computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may

   (B)   The reenactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a reenactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.

§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of such error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language should be used by the municipality to amend,
add, or repeal a chapter, section, or division:
      (1)   To amend a section: “Section                 of the Municipal Code
of Ordinances is amended to read as follows: . . . .”

statutory provision. Example: (R.C. § 4511.02)

§ 10.17 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.

incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The
liabilities, proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties, or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.

way, contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance,

documents by Robert's Rules of Order, newly revised.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.31 ORDINANCES.
   The term “ordinance” refers to the type of action by Council which is of a
general or permanent nature, creates a right, grants a franchise or invokes the
expenditure of money, the levying of a tax, or authorizes the purchase, lease,
sale or transfer of property.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.32 RESOLUTIONS.
   The term “resolution” is used in connection with the action of Council in

contempt of Council shall take place as the first item of business at the next
Council meeting following the vote in question.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.49 POLICY.
   When an ordinance, resolution or motion is before Council, an adequate and
reasonable opportunity shall be provided for all members of Council to be
heard. However, in order to expedite business and to assure that a member of
Council cannot effectively usurp Council's ability to conduct business, the
following shall apply:
   (A)   Rules of debate.
      (1)   The President or President Pro-Tem or such other member of the
Council as may be presiding shall recognize members and other persons who wish
to address Council. Such person shall confine himself or herself to the
question under debate, avoiding all personalities, refraining from impugning
the motive of any other member's argument or vote and abstaining from the use
of indecorous language.
         (a)   A member of Council shall not speak until recognized by the
President or President Pro-Tem. This shall be accomplished by the member
raising their hand.
         (b)   A member, once recognized, shall not be interrupted when
speaking unless it is to be called to order, or as herein otherwise provided.
         (c)   No member of Council shall be permitted to speak longer than
five minutes on any motion without permission of the President or President
Pro-Tem, who may grant the member additional time without exception from
Council.
         (d)   No member of Council shall be permitted to speak more than twice
on any one motion until every member desiring to speak on that motion shall
have had an opportunity to do so.
         (e)   Any member of Council granted the floor may yield to another
member of Council, with limitations set forth in divisions (c) and (d) above.
      (2)   No person (member of Council or public) shall utilize the privilege
of the floor before Council as a means for filibuster, prolonged speechmaking,
delaying legislative action and/or obstructionist tactics. If such person
engages in such behavior, he/she may be called to order by and subject to any
and all powers due the President of Council (see Duty of President of Council,
division (B) below).
   (B)   Duty of President of Council.
      (1)   The President of Council shall be the primary member of Council
responsible to preserve order and decorum and confine members in debate to the
question at hand.
      (2)   He/she may call any member to order who shall violate any of the
rules and shall, when in the chair, decide all questions of order, subject to
an appeal of Council made by at least two members. On such appeal, there shall
be no debate, but the member(s) making this appeal may briefly state his/her
reason(s) for the same, and the President shall have the same right to a
similar statement. A majority vote of Council shall decide the appeal.
      (3)   The President shall avoid appearance of partisanship on any
question. His/her function is to see that the business properly brought before
Council is conducted in an orderly, professional, effective and timely manner
and that the members of Council observe the rules of procedure.
      (4)   It is the duty of the President of Council to call a speaker to
order. If a speaker is called to order, he/she shall cease speaking
immediately, unless permitted to explain by the President. The question of
order shall then be decided without debate, and if the decision shall be in
favor of the speaker called to order, he/she shall then be at liberty to
proceed with his/her speech without leave of the Council.
   (C)   Decorum.
      (1)   While Council is in session, the members must preserve order and
decorum, and a member shall neither, by conversation or otherwise, delay or
interrupt the proceedings or the peace of the Council or disturb any member
while speaking or refuse to obey the orders of the Council or its presiding
officer, except as otherwise herein provided.
      (2)   Any person(s) making personal, impertinent or slanderous remarks
while Council is in session shall be forthwith, by the presiding officer,
barred from further attendance before the Council, unless permission to
continue be granted by a majority vote of the Council.
      (3)   The Chief of the Police Department, or such member or members of
the Police Department as he/she may designate, shall be Sergeant-at-Arms of the
Council meetings. He/she, or they, shall carry out all orders and instructions
given by the presiding officer for the purpose of maintaining order and decorum
at the Council meeting, including refusal of any person.
   (D)   Expulsion of members of Council. Council may punish or expel any
member for disorderly conduct or gross violation of these procedures,
regulations and rules of order, and declare his/her seat vacant for absence
without valid excuse, where such absence has continued for two months. No
expulsion shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the
members elected and until the delinquent member has been notified of the charge
against him/her and has had an opportunity to be heard.
   (E)   Protests against Council action. Any Council member shall have the
right to have the reason(s) for his/her dissent from, or protest against any
action of the Council entered in the minutes. This may be in protest against
Council action in the form of motion, resolution, ordinance, etc.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.50 EXCUSAL DURING MEETING.
   No member shall be excused while Council is in session except upon
permission of the Presiding Officer. no member shall be excused from attendance
at more than three council meetings except upon roll call and by a vote of the
majority of the members present.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.51 MOTIONS.
   (A)   Seconding of motions. All motions, except for a call to order, must be
seconded before being placed on the floor. The President of Council or Pro-Tem
shall restate the motion before entertaining debate or taking action.
   (B)   Motions that may be received during debate. When a question or
proposition is before Council or under debate, or when a motion has been made,
no motions shall be received except the following:
   To adjourn -   Undebatable
   To recess -    Undebatable
   To table -    Undebatable
   To end debate -    Undebatable
      To postpone to a definite time
      To refer to a committee
      To amend
      To postpone indefinitely
   These motions shall have precedence according to the above order.
   (C)   Motions enumerated.
      (1)   To adjourn. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except
upon immediate repetition thereof, or when a member has the floor, or when
Council is voting, and the same shall not be debatable.
      (2)   To appeal. An appeal may be made from any decision of the presiding
officer of Council, but it can be made only at the time when the ruling is
made. If this appeal is seconded, the presiding officer shall state clearly the
question at issue and his/her reason(s) for the decision, if he/she thinks it
necessary, and then state the question thus: The question is "Shall the
decision of the Chair be sustained?” If a majority vote yes, the ruling of the
presiding officer is sustained; otherwise the presiding officer is overruled.
      (3)   To withdraw a motion. When a motion is before Council and the mover
wishes to withdraw it if no one objects, the presiding officer grants
permission; if any objection is made, a formal motion to withdraw must be made.
When a motion is withdrawn, the effect is the same as if it had never been
made.
      (4)   To lay on the table. A motion to lay on the table shall preclude
all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the motion
shall prevail, the consideration of the subject may be resumed only upon a
motion to remove from the table by a member voting with the majority and with
the consent of a majority of the members present.
      (5)   To close debate. When a motion is made and seconded to close
debate, the presiding officer shall put the question “Shall debate be closed?”
If it fails, the discussion continues as if this motion had not been made. If
adopted, debate is immediately closed, except the member who introduced the
motion has the privilege of ending debate, and the vote is taken upon the
pending question including voting upon any pending amendments or motion to
refer.
      (6)   To reconsider. Any member who was absent or voted with the
prevailing side may move a reconsideration of any action of Council, except
measures which shall be in immediate effect. Such a motion for reconsideration
shall be made not later than the next regular meeting after the action to which
it relates was taken.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
§ 30.70 MEETINGS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC; CITIZENS MAY ADDRESS COUNCIL.
   (A)   All meetings of the City Council, except executive sessions, shall be
open to the public. R.C. § 121.22 requires that all public bodies generally
conduct their meetings in the open so that the public can have access to the
business discussed or transacted therein. However, access does not necessarily
include participation. There is nothing in the statute that requires that the
public body permit a member of the public to speak at the meeting.
   (B)   Therefore, every regular Council and Committee meeting of City Council
will be conducted in a way so that the citizens may address Council; except for
executive sessions or if a majority of Council members feel that citizen input
would not be practical or possible for that meeting.
   (C)   If a majority of Council decides to suspend these rules, thereby
prohibiting the ability of citizens to address Council during the meeting, then
that decision shall be announced prior to the beginning of the meeting.
(Ord. 99-3017, passed 5-20-99)
§ 30.71 RULES FOR ADDRESSING COUNCIL.
   (A)   Each person addressing the Council shall step up to the podium and
microphone, shall give his/her name and address in an audible tone of voice for
the record and unless further time is granted by Council, shall limit his/her
address to three to five minutes.
   (B)   The Mayor shall notify each speaker when four minutes has expired in
order that the speaker may begin to conclude his/her remarks. At the five-
minute point if the speaker is still speaking, the Mayor shall notify the
speaker that the time allocated has been completed and that the speaker should
conclude forthwith.
      (1)   In the event that the procedures, regulations and rules of order
for Council are not suspended to allow the speaker to continue, the speaker
shall be directed to return to his/her seat. In the event that the speaker
continues to speak, the President shall inform the speaker that the microphone
shall be disengaged.
      (2)   In the event the speaker continues to attempt to speak after the
microphone has been disengaged, he or she shall be escorted from Council
chambers by an appropriate municipal official and shall be asked either to
leave the premises or return quietly to his/her seat for the balance of the
Council meeting. In the event the person refuses either of these options, the
escorting officer may take such action as is appropriate under state law and/or
city ordinance.
   (C)   All remarks shall be addressed initially to the Mayor (President of
Council) who will respond to all comments/questions, as well as referring said
comments/questions to the appropriate Officer of Council, City Manager or
Department Head.
   (D)   No person, other than the Council and the person having the floor,
shall be permitted to enter into any discussion, either directly or through a
member of the Council, without the permission of the presiding officer.
   (E)   After the Mayor Officer of Council, City Manager or Department Head
responds to the initial comment/question, no other member of Council shall
enter into the discussion. This shall keep the proper division of committee
responsibilities, ensure an expedient Council meeting and prevent speechmaking
or other methods of filibuster.
   (F)   A public meeting or hearing is an opportunity for Council to receive
input from the citizens of the community. It is not a place for a debate
between persons in the audience, city staff or members of Council. Debating
tactics such as demanding answers to questions framed in favor of the speaker
are disfavored.

been an occasional entrant to the city performs services within the city, the
employer of said individual shall begin withholding the city income tax from
remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the city in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income

the taxpayer is considered a professional gambler for federal income tax
purposes.
   (B)   Allocation and apportionment of net profits. Net profits from a
business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the

property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
city during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer, and the value of that
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.

services performed during the taxable period in the city to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (4)   In the event the foregoing allocation formula in division (B)(1) of
this section does not produce an equitable result, the Board of Review, upon
application of the taxpayer, or the Tax Commissioner, shall, under uniform
regulations adopted by the Board of Review, have the authority to substitute
other factors (including the books and records method) or methods calculated to
effect a fair and proper allocation.

organizations and associations, when those receipts are from seasonal or casual

exempt from federal income tax.

copies of all W-2 and W-2G forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, page one of
form 1040, Page One and Two of Form 1120, 1120S (including (K-1), 2106, 1065,
schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or sold), schedule E,
schedule F and any other federal schedules, if applicable.
   (C)   Extensions. For taxable years 2004 and later, the extended due date
for individuals shall be the last day of the month following the month to which
federal income tax due date has been extended. For businesses, if the extension
is filed through the Ohio Business Gateway the extended due date shall be the
last day of the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return
has been extended. If not filed through the Ohio Business gateway the extended
due date shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. The Tax
Administrator may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails to file the request
timely, fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, or if the
taxpayer's income tax account with the city is delinquent in any way. The Tax
Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the
amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due.
If filed and paid within the extended time period, interest only shall be
assessed based on the date on which the extended return is actually filed and
paid. If filed and/or paid after the extended time period, interest and penalty
shall be assessed from the original due date.
   (D)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of §
36.05, or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of §
36.06, shall be deducted from the amount show to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the city is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded. Should the
taxpayer have a delinquent liability the overpayment will first be applied to
the delinquent liability. No taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall be
collected or refunded.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §
36.11. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e.
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return showing income subject the city tax based upon
such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax
shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (F)   Each resident taxpayer may offset business losses against business net
profits from any business conducted in the city or in any municipality that
does not levy an income tax on net profits therefrom.
   (G)   A loss from the operation of a business may not be used to offset the
income on a taxpayer's W-2 Form.
   (H)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (I)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the city.
      (2)    In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity with the city
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the city. If the Tax
Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the city by
reason of transaction with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the city.
   (J)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.

other compensation, the tax of one and one-quarter percent of the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, or other compensation due by the employer to the
employee and shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator
the amount of taxes so deducted. However, effective with tax withheld for the

the fifteenth day of the month following the month for which the tax was
withheld.
      (2)   The returns shall be on forms prescribed by or acceptable to the
Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. The employer shall be liable for the payment of the
tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not those taxes have in
fact been withheld.
   (B)   The employer in collecting the tax shall, until payment is made by the
employer to the city, be deemed to hold the same, as a trustee for the benefit
of the city, and any tax collected by the employer from his or her employees,
shall, until payment is made by the employer to the city, be deemed a trust
fund in the hands of the employer.
   (C)   (1)   On or before February 28 of each year beginning with the year
2001, each employer shall file a withholding return setting forth the names,
addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose compensation
the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax
withheld from his or her employees, and any other information required by the
Tax Administrator.
      (2)   On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or others who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (i.e. those who are not

of all 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses,
Social Security numbers and a total amount of earnings, payments, bonuses,
commissions and/or fees paid to each person for any services provided in the
city.

   (F)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the city,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall, prior to
commencement of the service, provide the city the names, addresses and federal
identification numbers of the subcontractors. The subcontractors shall be
responsible for all income tax employer requirements under this chapter.
   (G)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report
or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a
corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.

imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers, to
report all moneys so received, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration
or to make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and
amounts of payments thereof.
   (C)   (1)   The Tax Administrator is charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is empowered, subject to the approval of the
Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns. Taxpayers are
hereby required to comply not only with the provisions of this chapter, but
also with the rules and regulations.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Administrator that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. The
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under the chapter.

a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the city from
the taxpayer and shall send to the taxpayer a written statement (i.e.
assessment) showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and
penalties thereon, if any. If the taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment
within 30 days the tax, penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and

authorized to examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every employer, supposed
employer, taxpayer, or supposed taxpayer is directed and required to furnish,
within ten calendar days following a written request by the Tax Administrator,
or any authorized agent or employee thereof, the means, facilities, and
opportunity for making those examinations and investigations as are authorized.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to order any person presumed to
have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may examine that
person, under oath, concerning any income that was or should have been reported
for taxation or any transaction tending to affect that income, and for this
purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records, and federal and
state income tax returns and the attendance of all persons, whether as parties
or witnesses, whenever the Tax Administrator believes those persons have
knowledge of any income or information pertinent to the inquiry.
   (C)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records, and federal and state

      (2)   In addition to the penalty in §
36.99(B), any employee of the city who violates the provisions of this section
relative to the disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty of an
offense punishable by immediate dismissal.

§ 36.10 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after
they become due shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or fraction
of a month thereof.
   (B)   In addition to interest as provided in division (A) of this section,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld: 1.5% per
month or fraction of a month thereof.

   (C)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Tax Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Administrator. In the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may abate penalties in whole or in part.

§ 36.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; REFUNDS.
   (A)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by a by suit, as other debts of like amount
are recoverable. All additional assessments shall be made and all actions to
recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud, omission of 25% or more of
income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional
assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover municipal income
taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six years
after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later.
   (B)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for a
refund is made. Claims for refund of municipal income taxes must be brought
within three years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is
later. In addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld
from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employers terms and conditions
necessary to receive the non-qualified compensation.
   (C)   Income tax that has been deposited with the city, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the city as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that should have
been deposited with the city, but was deposited with another municipality,
shall be subject to recovery by the city. The city will allow a non-refundable
credit for any amount owed the city that is in excess of the amount to be
refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other
municipality is the same or higher than the city's tax rate. If the city's tax
rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates is also
subject to collection by the city.
   (D)   Amounts of less than $1 shall not be collected or refunded.

the Board of Review on appeal.
   (B)   All rules and regulations and amendments/changes thereto that are
adopted by the Tax Administrator pursuant to the authority conferred by this
chapter must be approved by the Board of Review before the same become
effective. The Board of Review shall hear and rule upon appeals from any ruling
or decision of the Tax Administrator, including appeals of penalty and
interest, and shall be empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation
at the request of the taxpayer or Tax Administrator.
   (C)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the Tax
Administrator that is made pursuant to the authority conferred by this chapter,
and who has filed the required returns or other documents pertaining to the
contested issue, may appeal therefrom to the Board of Review by filing a
request with the Board of Review. The request shall be in writing, shall state
why the ruling or decision should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be

beginning on or after January 1, 2004, any ruling or decision of the Board of
Appeal may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction or to the State
Board of Tax Appeals.

(Ord. 2643, passed 2-21-91)
PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY
§ 38.25 POLICY.
   It is the policy of the city to make all public records available for public
inspection by any person at reasonable times in accordance with R.C. § 149.43
(B)(1). All records of the city are public unless they are exempt from
disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.26 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The primary purpose of this policy is to set forth a general procedure
for providing city-wide, consistent, prompt, and equitable service to citizens
requesting access to public records. The Ohio Revised Code sets forth
categories of records to which the official custodian of records shall allow
public access and categories of records to which the official custodian shall
deny access.
   (B)   The secondary purpose of this policy is to establish reasonable and
consistent fees for providing copies as authorized by the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.27 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   PUBLIC RECORD, as defined by R.C. § 149.43(A) means records kept by any
public office including, but not limited to state, county, city, village,
township, and school district units, and records pertaining to the delivery of
educational services, by an alternative school in this state kept by the
nonprofit or for profit entity operating the alternative school pursuant to
R.C. § 3313.533. Ohio Revised Code § 149.43(A) expressly excludes certain
categories of records from the definition of PUBLIC RECORD. See R.C. § 149.43
(A)(1)(a)-(y).
   RECORDS, as defined by R.C. § 149.011(G), includes any document, device, or
item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, including an electronic
record as defined in R.C. § 1306.01, created or received by or coming under the
jurisdiction of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to
document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the office.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.28 SCOPE.
   This policy shall apply to all city public records and copies of information
requested or released with the exception of records exempted from the
definition of PUBLIC RECORD under R.C. § 149.43(A).
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.29 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Clerk of Council is the official Public Records Custodian of all
records which are centrally maintained by the city. Department heads or
designees are the official Public Records Custodians of all records maintained
within their departments. The Clerk of Council is the official Public Records
Custodian of emails. It is the responsibility of each department head to become
familiar with and to educate his or her affected employees about the standards
and requirements of this policy.
   (B)   Public records requests will be accommodated during regular business
hours between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. local time on regular business days.
Public records requests will not be accepted on weekends, holidays, or outside
regular business hours.
   (C)   A public records request may be made in writing or verbally. The
Public Records Custodian may ask the requestor to put a verbal request in
writing, or for the requestor to give identifying information, but neither a
written request nor identifying information are required. However, such would
benefit the requestor by enhancing the ability of the Public Records Custodian
to identify, locate, and deliver the public records requested.
   (D)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requestor must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, locate, retrieve, and review the
records. If it is not clear what records are being sought, the records
custodian must contact the requestor for clarification, and should assist the
requestor in revising the request by informing the requestor of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
   (E)   The actual time required to comply with the request may depend on the
circumstances, such as the location of the records or the volume of records
being requested, and the necessity for any legal review of the records
requested.
   (F)   Public records can be accessed by one of the following methods: a
request to view public records in person; a request for copies of public
records that the requestor will personally pick up from the Public Records
Custodian; or a request for copies of public records that the requestor wants
to have mailed or otherwise delivered to the requestor.
   (G)   Request to view public records. The requestor may make a request to
view public records to the Public Records Custodian, who shall prepare the
public records for inspection "promptly," as required by the Ohio Revised Code.
As set forth above, the actual time required to comply with the request may
depend on the circumstances, such as the location of the records or the volume
of records being requested.
   (H)   Copies of public records.
      (1)   The requestor may make a request to have copies of public records
made to the Public Records Custodian. Copies made on 8½" x 11" paper are $0.05
per black and white single-sided copy. Color copies requested on 8½" x 11"
paper cost $0.07 per single-sided copy. All copy charges must be paid in
advance before copies are made. If the Public Records Custodian uses an outside
copying service to make the copies (see division (H)(2) of this section), the
requestor will be required to pay the cost of the entire copying job, as billed
by the copying service. Copies that are requested in some format other than
paper will be "at cost," without taking into account employee time spent
preparing the copies. For example, public records in electronic format placed
on a CD will be assessed the cost of the CD, plus the cost, if any, of creating
the electronic copies.
      (2)   Public records will be copied only by the Public Records Custodian
or other authorized officers, employees, or representatives. The Public Records
Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies, at the Public
Records Custodian's discretion. Under no circumstances will the requestor be
permitted to make the copies himself or herself. The manner of the making of
copies is at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian. Requests to copy a
certain number of public records on a given page, by "reducing" copy size or
otherwise, may be met at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian.
      (3)   Copies will be made available by the Public Records Custodian
"within a reasonable time," as required by the Ohio Revised Code. The time for
compliance will depend upon the availability of records and the volume of
records requested.
   (I)   Transmitting copies of public records.
      (1)   A requestor may request that copies of public records be
transmitted to him or her by U.S. Mail or by any other means of transmission
that is available and is conducive to transmitting the public records, such as
FedEx, UPS, fax, or email. The cost of transmitting must be paid by the
requestor before the public records will be transmitted. There is no charge for
documents emailed. While the city is under no obligation to provide records in
electronic format, it is the policy of the city to provide information to the
public in the most convenient way that is practical, considering all of the
circumstances. Therefore, if the city receives a request for information to be
made available in an electronic format, such request will be forwarded to the
Public Records Custodian for a determination as to whether such information
will be generated and released in an electronic format.
      (2)   Copies will be transmitted to the requestor by the Public Records
Custodian "within a reasonable time," as required by the Ohio Revised Code. The
time for compliance will depend upon the availability of records and the volume
of records requested.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.30 PAYMENT.
   Charges for copies or for transmission of copies (e.g., via fax, U.S. Mail,
FedEx, UPS, etc.) can be paid for with cash, credit card, check, money order,
certified check, made payable to City of Silverton. If payment is made by
check, copies will not be made until the check has cleared and been paid by the
requestor's bank. All charges must be paid in their entirety, in advance. A
requestor may pay an amount that the Public Records Custodian estimates to
cover the cost of copies or means of transmission. If that amount is determined
to be insufficient, the copies will not be made or transmitted until the entire
amount due is paid. If the amount was in excess of the cost of the copies or
means of transmission, the excess will be repaid to the requestor. The Public
Records Custodian has the authority to waive such fees and charges.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.31 EMAIL.
   (A)   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content meets the definition of non-exempt public
records. Email is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats
and should follow the same retention schedules.
   (B)   Those records in private email accounts used to conduct public
business are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the
city are instructed to retain their emails that relate to public business and
to copy them to their business email accounts and/or to the city's Director of
Information Technology as the official Public Records Custodian of emails.
   (C)   The Public Records Custodian is to treat the emails used to conduct
public business from private accounts as records of the city, filing them in
the appropriate way, retaining them per established schedules and making them
available for inspection and copying in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 07-3250, passed 10-18-07)
§ 38.32 DENIAL OF A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   (A)   Under certain circumstances, records are not defined as "public
records" under Ohio law. In these situations, the public records request will
be denied on that basis. The Ohio Revised Code requires that any denial be
supported by legal authority. A denial that is responding to a written public
records request will also be given in writing. Written reasons for denial will
not be required for non-written public records requests.
   (B)   The Ohio Revised Code regards certain actions as being "denials" of
public record requests. These situations are addressed in the following
paragraphs.
   (C)   Redaction.
      (1)   The Ohio Revised Code defines a "redaction" as "obscuring or
deleting any information that is exempt from the duty to permit public
inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets the definition of a
'record' in section 149.011 of the Revised Code." Examples of redaction are
"blacking out" or "whiting out" or "cutting out" portions of a document.
      (2)   When a public record contains information that is not within the
definition of a "public record" as defined by law, the Public Records Custodian
will make available that portion of the public record that does meet the
definition of a "public record." The Public Records Custodian shall make a copy
of the public record, perform the redaction, then make a copy of that sheet and
make the second copy available to the requestor. The requestor will not be
charged for the first copy made. The first copy will be retained by the Public
Records Custodian. Each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting
explanation, including legal authority.
   (D)   Requests that are ambiguous, overly broad, or difficult to identify
the public records requested. At times, a requestor may make a public records
request from which the Public Records Custodian cannot determine what public
records the requestor is seeking. In such circumstances, the Public Records
Custodian will inform the requestor that the public records request is denied
but will give the requestor an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records sought. If the requestor is seeking public records organized in
a certain way, but the public records are not organized in that way, the Public
Records Custodian will inform the requestor of the manner that the public
records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed. The
requestor may then submit a public records request that more accurately
reflects the organization of the public records and the actual public records
sought by the requestor.

alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §

otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and

         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. or 2. of this section, the location that
the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2) of this section:
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §
39.04.

§ 39.04 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING; PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   An annual village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer and any taxpayer that is not an individual for each
taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax
is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under this section when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the village.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for village income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives municipal taxable income taxable to the village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the village, the return or notice required of that individual shall
be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)   The village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the village . No remittance is
required if the net amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the village's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
village's income tax return. The extended due date of the village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (G)(3), or (G)(4) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the village an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under §
39.06(B)(1)(a) or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in §
39.06 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file a village
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a village income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be
due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
      (4)   This division is not subject to R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95. See
division (Z) of this section for election to be subject to R.C. §§ 718.80 to
718.95.
   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (O)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the village in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (O)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) of this
section is binding upon the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Municipal Tax
Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (V)(3), and
(V)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
39.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
39.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the village;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (Z)   (1)   The village hereby adopts and incorporates herein by reference
R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
      (2)   (a)   A taxpayer, as defined in division (D) of this section, may
elect to be subject to R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95 by making the initial election
with the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner. A taxpayer shall make the initial
election on or before the first day of the third month after the beginning of
the taxpayer's taxable year by notifying the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner and
each municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducted business during the
previous taxable year, on a form prescribed by the State of Ohio Tax
Commissioner.
         (b)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the taxable
year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year until
the taxpayer notifies the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner and each municipal
corporation in which the taxpayer conducted business during the previous
taxable year of its termination of the election.
         (c)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of
the third month of any taxable year.
         (d)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95, and is instead
subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of R.C. Chapter 718 in
addition to the remainder of this chapter.
   (AA)   Upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State of Ohio Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole
administrator of each municipal income tax for which the taxpayer is liable for
the term of the election;
      (2)   The State of Ohio Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax
pursuant to R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95 and any applicable provision of R.C.
Chapter 5703.
   (BB)   Division (Z) of this section is effective for taxable years beginning
on or after January 1, 2018.
   (CC)   “Taxpayer” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 718.01, except that
“taxpayer” does not include natural persons or entities subject to the tax
imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745. “Taxpayer” may include receivers, assignees,

§ 39.05 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator. A taxpayer cannot change the method of accounting (i.e., cash or
accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
39.13 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division, if the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by the village. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
39.14.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended village return showing income subject to the
village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than $10.

§ 39.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT SOURCE.
   Withholding Provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or deemed to be received by each employee in the village. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under § 39.03 or
division (B)(4), (B)(6), or (B)(12) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in §
39.01(B)(1), of 1.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
            Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)   [Intentionally left blank.]
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the village as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

an employer.
         (b)   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (C)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted
for "municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.

an employee.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (C)(3), (C)(5), (C)(6), and (C)(7) of
this section, an employer is not required to withhold the village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the village if the employee performed such services in the village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
village.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in this section.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (C)

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the village.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
39.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the village.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of this section.

§ 39.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of

on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year,
90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual

39.04.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
39.12 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the village under §
39.04 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   Identification Information.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
39.12 in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
39.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
39.12.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
39.99 for a violation of §
39.21 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

return after the taxpayer files that return.

   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,

            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
39.22. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

the time limitation provided in §
39.14.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
39.14, with interest on that amount as provided by §
39.14(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover the village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

§ 39.14 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
§
39.12.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
39.22.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
39.12(A)(4).

§ 39.15 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the village is subject to recovery by the village. If
the village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If the village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
village's tax rate. However, if the village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

§ 39.17 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (1)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      (2)   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

§ 39.18 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
      "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

§ 39.19 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the village that arises pursuant to the village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

§ 39.20 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by R.C. Chapter 718 or by the
Code of Ordinances or by the ordinance of the village is confidential, and no
person shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a
proper judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's
official duties or the official business of the village as authorized by R.C.
Chapter 718 or the Code of Ordinances or the ordinance authorizing the levy.
The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed
or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax information to
the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of
other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the village from publishing or
disclosing statistics, or using such statistics for official purposes or
official business, in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.

claim, or document authorized or required by the village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Manager
of the village. This member may be an employee of the village, but may not be
the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or

purpose of construction, or for any other purpose, must first obtain a permit
from the municipality, for which no fee shall be charged.
      (2)   The City Manager has the authority to grant permits for the removal
of trees from public places. Such permits may be denied if the removal of tree
(s) from a public place is not necessary for the protection of public health
and safety; or can be reasonably avoided; or, in the case of realty development
or construction, unless the permit request is accompanied by a plan to protect
public trees in the general vicinity of construction and add new trees and/or
landscaping if part of the tree lawn is to be removed. The city shall review

right-of-way; or set fire or permit fire to burn in any manner that injures any
portion of any tree or shrub on public property or in the public right-of-way.

badly enough to justify removal, as determined by the City Manager, shall be
considered to be devalued. The person or entity causing such damage shall
compensate the city for such damage. The monetary amount shall be determined by
the City Manager or his or her designee, based on the assessment of an arborist
of the monetary investment required to save the tree(s); or, if there is a
likelihood the tree(s) will not survive the damage inflicted, then the cost of
replacement of tree(s) of like species and caliper; or, if a different species
is more suitable based upon current best practices, or the tree(s) is/are too
large to be replaced in kind, then the cost of replacement with tree(s) of
minimum caliper within one to two inches of the same species or more suitable
species, as judged by a licensed arborist.
   (E)   Crown reduction. As a matter of policy, the City Manager should make
all utility providers aware of the standards for crown reduction of public and
street trees within the city, and take all reasonable steps to ensure that the
pruning of public trees by utility companies is consistent with these
standards. Street trees or public trees shall not be topped. When the trees are
severely damaged by storms or other natural causes, or when such trees are
under utility wires or other obstructions, the branches shall be directional
pruned to mitigate the problem.

responsible for, the erection, alteration, or removal of any building or
structure in the municipality shall permit any tree upon any public place in
the vicinity of such operation to stand without a good and sufficient guard or
protection as to prevent injury, damage, or defacement to such tree arising out
of, in connection with, or by reason of such operation. The sufficiency of such
guard or protection shall be determined by the City Manager at the time of such
erection, alteration, or removal.
   (C)   No person shall excavate ditches, tunnels, trenches or install a
driveway or sidewalk within a radius of ten feet of any public tree or shrub
without first obtaining written approval from the City Manager.

that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of

section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an

traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or

control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

other substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, in addition to any other
sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class one suspension

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or

§ 70.24 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the holder’s parent
or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or

available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (F) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.

sentencing.

the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         (c)   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of

in R.C. § 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with
any other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or

the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical

tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.011, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any

private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of
abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,

shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests

      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who

submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (C) of this section, but the
officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person
refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable
means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise
the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of
this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant
to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (C) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of § 73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid,
or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle, in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

§ 74.44 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self- contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self- contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

(B)(6) of this section that the veterinarian who is charged with the violation
obtained, prior to debarking or surgically silencing the dog, a written waiver
form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and that attests that
the dog is not a dangerous dog.
      (9)   (a)   The County Auditor shall issue a dangerous dog registration

permanently identified by means of a microchip and the dog’s microchip number.
         (b)   Upon the issuance of a dangerous dog registration certificate to
the owner of a dog, the County Auditor shall provide the owner with a uniformly
designed tag that identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall
renew the certificate annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the
initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (B)(9)
(c)2. of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
         (c)   1.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.
            2.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration

section.
(R.C. § 955.22)
   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, §
90.38(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog, and § 90.46 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a
dangerous dog, and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those
provisions apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in
that manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper,
or harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a)
in an amount described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.
(R.C. § 955.222)
   (D)   Penalty.

a dangerous dog.
         (b)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (D)(2)(a) of
this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at
the owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final
determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that
division and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or
restrained in accordance with division (B)(4) of this section or at the county
dog pound at the owner’s expense.

county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed
under division (D)(4)(a)2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that §
90.38(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog and that § 90.46 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a
dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall order the offender to
obtain the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) of this
section in an amount, exclusive of interest and costs, that equals or exceeds
$100,000. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal of a violation of division (B)(3) of this section and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with the provisions described in division (B)(4) of this section or
at the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.

division (D)(3), (D)(4), or (D)(6) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all

determination under division (D)(3), (D)(4), or (D)(6) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (D)(9)(a) of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the
security provided under division (D)(9)(a) of this section is greater than that

GRAFFITI PREVENTION AND ABATEMENT
§ 91.90 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the words and phrases defined in the
sections of this subchapter shall have the meanings therein respectively
ascribed to them, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the
context.
(Ord. 10-3323, passed 6-17-10)
§ 91.91 GRAFFITI.
   GRAFFITI means any inscription, word, figure, marking or design that is
marked, etched, scratched, drawn or painted on any premises, including
buildings, structures, fixtures or other improvements, whether permanent or
temporary, whether public or private, without the consent of the owner of the
property or the owner's authorized agent, and which is visible from the public
right-of-way or other public or quasi-public location within the city.
(Ord. 10-3323, passed 6-17-10)
§ 91.92 PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Graffiti is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the community
in that it degrades the community and leads to urban blight. Also, it is
detrimental to property values, business opportunities and the city's aesthetic
standards. When graffiti is permitted to remain on property and is not promptly
abated, it invites additional graffiti and criminal activity, further
deteriorating the city's quality of life and discrediting the city's reputation
for livability. Graffiti, whether located upon public or private premises
within the City of Silverton, is hereby declared a public nuisance. Every
owner, occupant, or person in control of any premises within the city shall
cause the premises to be kept clear and free of such graffiti, and otherwise
comply with the requirements of this chapter.

the premises in accordance with division (C) of this section. The City Manager
may prepare and distribute forms for this purpose.
   (B)   If the City Manager or his designee determines that graffiti exists on
private property within the city, the City Manager may cause a graffiti
abatement notice to be served, which will provide notice of the City Manager's
determination that the premises contain graffiti in violation of §
91.92, and that the property owner has seven calendar days from the date of the
notice in which to remove the graffiti, consent to removal of the graffiti by
the City Manager, notify the City Manager in writing that he or she has
consented or consents to the graffiti, or request a hearing before the City
Manager or his designee. The notice shall be provided by the means specified in
§
91.94 and shall state that the owner may authorize the city to remove the
graffiti by giving written consent and a waiver of liability in accordance with
division (C) of this section.
   (C)   As a condition for allowing the City Manager to remove the graffiti,
the owner shall also sign a release on a form provided by the City Manager
releasing the city from liability for damage to public or private property in
connection with the removal of graffiti. The owner may give advance consent to
the City Manager to remove graffiti from the premises in the future without the
need for the City Manager to obtain the owner's consent prior to each removal.
Such prior authorization shall be in writing to the City Manager and shall be
signed by the owner. The prior authorization may be revoked by the owner at any
time by notifying the City Manager in writing.
   (D)   If the City Manager has not received consent from the owner within
seven days from the date of the notice provided in accordance with §
91.94, the City Manager may remove the graffiti found to be in violation of §
91.92.
   (E)   Whenever the City Manager is authorized by this subchapter to remove
graffiti, and uses public funds for such purpose, the City Manager shall not
authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or graffiti removal of any
more extensive area than that where the graffiti is located, except in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The City Manager determines in a written notice to the owner that a
more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid
an esthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community; or
      (2)   The owner agrees to pay for the costs of repainting the more
extensive area.
   (F)   Where property defaced by graffiti is owned by a public entity other
than the city, the City Manager shall remove the graffiti only after securing
the consent of an authorized representative of the public entity that has
jurisdiction over the premises.
   (G)   Nothing in this chapter shall relieve any private person or entity,
including utility companies, which occupy the public right-of-way pursuant to
permit, franchise or license, of the obligation to keep its facilities in
repair, clean, and free of graffiti.
(Ord. 10-3323, passed 6-17-10)
§ 91.94 GRAFFITI ABATEMENT ACTION; NOTICE; APPEAL.
   (A)   Whenever the City Manager determines that graffiti exists in violation
of §
91.92, the City Manager may cause a graffiti abatement notice to be served as
follows:

owner fails to take one of these actions within the above time, the premises
shall thereafter be subject to abatement of the graffiti by the City Manager.
(Ord. 10-3323, passed 6-17-10)
§ 91.95 HEARING; ABATEMENT ORDER.
   (A)   At the hearing requested by the owner of the premises, the owner shall
be entitled to present evidence and argue that his or her property does not
contain graffiti and address any other issue which pertains to the abatement
proceeding. The determination of the City Manager or his designee shall be
final.
   (B)   After the hearing, if the City Manager or his designee determines that
the premises contain graffiti, the City Manager or his designee may order that
the graffiti be abated. Before ordering such abatement, the City Manager or his
designee shall give final written notice ("abatement order") served in
accordance with §
91.94 that, unless the graffiti is removed within seven calendar days from the
date of the final notice, the Service Department shall enter upon the premises
and cause the removal, painting over or such other eradication of the graffiti
as the City Manager or his designee determines is appropriate.

are set forth below.
   (B)   Properties at which two or more violations of this chapter have
occurred within a 12 month period, which are abated, shall be charged an
administrative fee to recover the costs that the village incurs for the
repeated corrections of such violations. This fee shall only be charged when a
second violation occurs and for all other violations thereafter. In the event
this fee is not paid within 14 days of the mailing on the notice, then the cost
thereof shall be reported to the Clerk, who shall certify it to the County
Auditor, to be placed upon the tax duplicate and collected and paid back to the
city.
   (C)   In addition, the administrative fee, with the approval of Council,

schedule gives the administrative charges to be added to the total cost of

section, the Commission or trier of fact shall consider that reasonable
reliance upon the identification presented and the completed transaction scan

holder from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

who issued an identification card under R.C. §§ 4507.50 to 4507.52 shall be
permitted to submit certified copies of the records of that issuance in lieu of

operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the
city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier
and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.

current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (C)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the city is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
the city shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the city.
      (2)   If the city or the ICRC takes no action within 30 days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (D)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the city is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city shall, within
60 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the
city and by adoption of a formal ordinance, invoke the following additional
periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the city needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If the city has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day
period, the city shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the city or the ICRC shall hold at least one
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision ordinance is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector's name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the city or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
the city or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10% or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992 and
the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city will review a
cost-of-service review. The City may approve initial basic cable rates above
the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing. However, a
cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below
the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minimum 10%, will prescribe the
cable operator's new rates.
   (I)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the city or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city shall adopt its
decision by formal ordinance. The decision shall include one of the following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard

   (A)   Notice. a cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the
cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the city or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the
city shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city.
      (2)   If the city takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go into
effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, the city or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the city and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city
shall, by adoption of a formal ordinance, invoke the following additional
periods of time as applicable, to make a final determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the city or the ICRC need more time to ensure
that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable
price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the city has not made a decision within the 90 to 150 day
period, the city shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (D)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the city or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (E)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision ordinance is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of
the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector's name
and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the city is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the city later issues a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city shall
review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on the city's findings, the basic cable rates
shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the city shall disapprove the proposed rate increase
and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the city will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. The city may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate.
   (I)   Decision. The city's decision concerning the requested rate increase
shall be adopted by formal ordinance. If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increases, the ordinance must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the secretary to record the objection or may be submitted in
writing at any time before the decision ordinance is adopted.
   (J)   Refunds.
      (1)   The city may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with
interest if:
         (a)   The city was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period as described in paragraph (C) above; and
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The city determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the city disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city's decision ordinance.
   (K)   Appeal. The city's decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations.

determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.

      (2)   As used in this division:
         OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC
SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or

misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2).
         PUBLIC SERVANT. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 of the Revised
Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed
or five years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (‘91 Code § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (‘91 Code § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (‘91 Code § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) ('91 Code § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates’ industrial and entertainment
fund of the institution if the sender is not known.

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)

§ 130.21 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 to 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond

         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.22 SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the

(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the

               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.

treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs

confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.

this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering

installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §

         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),

and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or

offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same

(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

   It shall be the duty of each property owner to determine property lines and
to ascertain that the fence thus constructed does not deviate from the plans as
approved by the Building Inspector issuing permits, and said fence does not
encroach upon another lot or parcel of land. The city shall furnish such
inspection as is deemed necessary to determine that said fence is constructed
in accordance with plans submitted for permit as outlined in § 150.031 hereof,
provided, however, that the issuance of said permit by the city shall not be
construed as to mean the city has determined said fence is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duties imposed upon
him herein.

each. Any permit shall become invalid if the authorized work remains
uninitiated, or is suspended, postponed, or abandoned throughout any six-month
period.

over any land at any time if by virtue of the sale, lease, or easement any
clearance, yard, or court space prescribed by this chapter or the zoning of

permit is required by this chapter without first having obtained a permit
therefor shall, if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a
permit, pay double the permit fees prescribed by § 150.120 provided, however,
that this requirement shall not apply to emergency work or installations as
provided by § 150.057, when it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the
Building Inspector that such work or installation was urgently necessary and
that it would have been impractical to have awaited the normal time consumed in
the application for and issuance of the permit. Nevertheless, even in
emergencies, the required permit shall be obtained without unreasonable delay
after installation starts, and in no case more than three days in which the
office of the Building Inspector is open for business, or the extra fee as
herein provided shall be charged for the permit.
   (B)   Before issuing such permit, the Building Inspector shall take
necessary steps to determine whether the work performed prior to the date of
permit and inspection conforms to this chapter. These steps may include, but
shall not be limited to directing the tearing out of sections of surface work
for access to subsurface sections, digging for access to foundations, piping,
and other subterranean work, and the like. The applicant for the permit shall
perform all such work as may be directed at his own expense.

collapse of a building or structure, or the existence of defective equipment or
service facilities so as to endanger life or health, or any other condition
that requires immediate action to make repairs necessary to prevent the
occurrence of such a failure or collapse or the occurrence of any danger, where
the time available is not sufficient to allow the securing of a permit from the
Building Inspector as required by this chapter, the person, firm, or
corporation required to perform the repairs may proceed to do so after having
first notified the Building Inspector of the fact without obtaining a permit as
required by this chapter. In case the Building Inspector is unavailable, notice
shall be given to the nearest fire or police official.

indicates a conflict with an easement, right-of-way, or facility of a public
utility or public authority, the Building Inspector shall notify the utility or
authority concerned and allow seven days' interval before issuing a permit to
allow the utility or authority to contest the applicant's right to build as
proposed.
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, the record plan for a subdivision or

and the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for inspection, the Building
Inspector shall inspect the work or cause it to be inspected as soon as

district; and
            7.   Other factors deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission.
         (d)   City Council public hearing and final action.
            1.   After receiving from the Planning Commission the certificate
of such recommendations on the proposed amendment, supplement or change, and
before adoption of such amendment, supplement or change, Council shall hold a
public hearing thereon, at least 15 days’ notice of the time and place of which
shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
city. If the proposed amendment, supplement or change proposes to rezone or
redistrict ten or less parcels of land, as listed in the tax duplicate, written
notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the Clerk of Council, by certified
mail, with return receipt, at least 15 days before the date of the public
hearing to the owners of all real property within 300 feet of the parcel or
parcels, to the addresses of the owners appearing on the Hamilton County
Auditor's current tax list and such other lists as may be required by Council.
            2.   Following such hearing and after reviewing the recommendations
of the Commission thereon, Council shall consider such recommendations and vote
on the passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning Code or the
Zoning Map. Council may overrule the recommendations of the Commission by a
majority vote by Council.
         (e)   Stay of permits on pending Zoning Map change. Whenever Council
has taken under advisement, a change or amendment of the Zoning Map from a less
restricted district to a more restricted district classification, as evidenced
by resolution of record, no zoning permit or building permit shall be issued
within 75 days from the date of such resolution which would authorize the
construction of a building or the establishment of a use which would become
nonconforming under the contemplated redistricting plan.
   (G)   Zoning permits required. It shall be unlawful for an owner to use or
permit the use of any land or any structure, or part thereof hereafter created,
erected, converted, enlarged, or changed, wholly or partly in its use or
construction, until the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have issued a zoning
permit. The zoning permit shall show that the structure or premises, or part
thereof, and the proposed use thereof are in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
      (1)   Approval of a zoning permit. Within 30 days after the receipt of an
application containing information and fees as required by division (D) and (E)
of this section, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall either approve or
disapprove the zoning permit application in conformance with the provisions of
this Zoning Code. One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer after the Zoning Enforcement Officer has marked
such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to the same by his or
her signature on such copy. Failure to notify the applicant in the case of such
refusal or disapproval within the specified time shall entitle the applicant to
submit his or her request to the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Expiration of a zoning permit. If the work described in any zoning
permit has not yet been substantially initiated within one year of the date of
issuance thereof, said permit shall expire and be revoked by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer upon written notice given to the persons or business entity
affected. If the work described in any zoning permit has not yet been
substantially completed within two years of the date of issuance thereof, said
permit shall expire and be revoked by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. A written
notice shall be given to the persons or business entity affected, together with
notice that further work, as described in the canceled permit, shall not
proceed unless and until a new zoning permit has been obtained or an extension
granted. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may only issue one extension for an
additional calendar year based on good cause shown by the applicant. In the
event a zoning permit is deemed to have expired under the provisions under this
Zoning Code, any fees paid to the city required as part of the zoning permit
application and review process shall be non-refundable.
      (3)   Construction and use as provided in applications, plans and
permits. Zoning permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer authorize only the use and arrangement set
forth in such approved plans and applications or amendments thereof and no
other use, arrangement, or construction shall be allowed. Use, arrangement, or
construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a punishable violation
of this Zoning Code.
      (4)   Entry and inspection of property. The Zoning Enforcement Officer is
authorized to make inspections of properties and structures in order to examine
and survey the same, at any reasonable hour, for the purpose of enforcing the
provisions of this Zoning Code. Prior to seeking entry to any property or
structure for such examination or survey, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
attempt to obtain the permission of the owner or occupant to inspect. If such
permission is denied or cannot be obtained, the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall request the assistance of the City Solicitor in securing a valid search
warrant prior to entry.
      (5)   Zoning permit revocation. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may issue
a revocation notice to revoke a zoning permit which was issued contrary to this
Zoning Code or based upon false information or misrepresentation in the
application.
   (H)   Notice of violation. Whenever the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his or
her agent determines that there is a violation of any provision of this Zoning
Code, a certified letter to the property owner shall be issued and shall serve
as the notice of violation. Failure to remedy the alleged violation within the
specified time frame set forth in the violation letter shall result in the
levying of penalties and fines pursuant to §
153.01(G). Such certified letter shall:
      (1)   Include a statement of the reasons why it is being issued and refer
to the sections of this Zoning Code being violated.
      (2)   State the time by which the violation shall be corrected.
      (3)   If a certified mail envelope is returned with endorsement showing
that the envelope is unclaimed at a valid address, then service shall be sent
by ordinary mail and the mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing
which shall be filed by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Service shall be deemed
complete when the fact of mailing is entered in record, provided that the
ordinary mail envelope is not returned by the postal authorities with an
endorsement showing failure of delivery. A posting of the notice of violation
upon the property in a conspicuous manner shall constitute proper service under
this division.
      (4)   A copy of the administrative appeals procedure and documentation
requirements as set forth in this Zoning Code shall be included in the
certified letter.
   (I)   Remedies. In case any building or structure is or is intended to be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or
maintained, or any building, structure, or land is or is intended to be used,
in violation of this Zoning Code, the City Solicitor, in addition to the
remedies herein provided for, is authorized to institute any appropriate action
or proceeding in law or equity to prevent an unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use or to
restrain, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use or to restrain,
correct, or abate the violation.

limited to, photographs, maps, site plans, drawings, correspondence and any
other materials deemed to be relevant to the alleged error. The Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals all papers
constituting the record upon which the action being appealed was taken. Failure

applicant's right from seeking an administrative appeal under this section.
   (C)   Application for an area variance. Applications for an area variance
shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer with all fees and
application content required pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E).
   (D)   Public hearing by the Board. When an application for appeal or an area

the application fee has been paid, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall place
the request upon the calendar for public hearing before the Board of Zoning
Appeals pursuant to the procedural requirements set forth §
153.04(E).
   (E)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of the appeal has
been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the permit, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed by other than a restraining order granted by a court having appropriate
jurisdiction.
   (F)   Review of an appeal. 
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the appeal. To aid in
their review, the Board may transmit the application to appropriate
administrative departments and professional consultants for review and comment.
Any reports, comments, or expert opinions shall be compiled by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and transmitted to the Board prior to the time of the
Board's review.
      (2)   Decision of the Board. Within the limits of the powers set forth in
this Zoning Code, the Board of Zoning Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination being
appealed, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom
the appeal is taken, and it may direct the issuance of a zoning permit.
         (a)   Any decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals requires the
concurrence of a majority of the members present for the vote. The Board shall
render a decision on the appeal within 30 days from the date the Board closes
the public hearing, unless an extended period of time is mutually agreed upon
by the applicant and the Board.
         (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant in
writing of the decision of the Board, which shall include the reasons for the
action taken.
      (3)   Review criteria. An administrative order, decision, determination
or interpretation shall not be reversed or modified unless there is competent,
material, and substantial evidence in the record that the order, decision,
determination or interpretation fails to comply with either the procedural or
substantive requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (G)   Review of area variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize
upon appeal in specific cases of an area variance from the terms of this Zoning
Code as will not be contrary to the public interest according to the following
procedures:
      (1)   Definition. Area variances shall be considered those variances from
a zoning regulation that establishes minimum or maximum areas, heights,
distances, separation volume or any other measurement, which is expressed in
terms of a geometric measurement.
      (2)   Review by the Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a
public hearing and give notice of the same pursuant to §
153.04(E). The Board shall review each application for an area variance to
determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and
evidence demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will
result in practical difficulty. The following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the Board to determine practical difficulty:
         (a)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         (b)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         (c)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         (d)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         (e)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, or trash pickup;
         (f)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         (g)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         (h)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance;
         (i)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
         (j)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on
the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (3)   Requests for additional information. The Board of Zoning Appeals
may request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board
deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
      (4)   Conditions and safeguards. The Board may further prescribe any
conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the objectives
of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies will be met.
      (5)   Action by the Board. The Board shall either approve, approve with
conditions as specified in division (G)(4), above, or disapprove the request
for an area variance. In no case shall the Board of Zoning Appeals approve a
variance that establishes a nonconforming use of land, building or structure
where one had not previously existed.
      (6)   Term and extension of variance. Area variances shall be non-
assignable without the written approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals and
shall expire one year from the date of the variance issuance, unless prior
thereto, the applicant substantially initiated work within one year in
accordance with the granted variance or an extension of time has been granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. “Substantially initiated” shall mean expending
monies towards completing the project equal to at least 25% of the value of the
total work to be performed. A variance shall also expire if the applicant fails
to substantially complete the work within two years from the date of the
variance issuance. “Substantially completed” shall mean expending monies
towards completing the project equal to at least 90% of the value of the total
work to be performed. Once the time limit pursuant to this section has expired,
a request for a variance shall be considered to be a new application for a
variance and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to
this section. Area variances approved in conjunction with a site plan shall
remain valid for a one-year period.
   (H)   Use variances. The granting of use variances shall be prohibited. An
applicant seeking to use a structure or parcel of land in a manner that is not
consistent with the permitted uses or conditional uses for the zoning district
in question, may seek a change in land use through an amendment of the zoning
map or zoning text following the procedure set forth in §
153.02(F).
(Ord. 2025-10, passed 5-1-25)
§ 153.06 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   Site plan review applicability.
      (1)   In order to administer the provisions of this Zoning Code and to
evaluate site plans in the interest of the public health, safety and general
welfare, this section shall apply to new property development and any
collective substantial expansion of existing structures, new or expanded
parking lots consisting of the creation of five new parking spaces or more,
except for individual single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings
(duplexes). Substantial expansion of existing structures shall be defined based
on the criteria established below:
 
Table 1: Substantial Expansion of Existing Structures
When the Existing Structure is: A Substantial Expansion is:
0 - 1,000 sq. ft.               50% or greater
1,001 - 10,000 sq. ft.          40% or greater
10,001 - 25,000 sq. ft.         30% or greater
25,001 - 50,000 sq. ft.         20% or greater
50,001 sq. ft. and larger       10% or greater
 
      (2)   Furthermore, no building shall be erected or structurally altered
on any lot or parcel in cases where a site plan review is required, except in
accordance with the regulations of this section and all other applicable
sections within this Zoning Code and an approved site plan. No zoning permit
shall be issued prior to the approval of a site plan.
   (B)   Procedure for site plan review.
      (1)   Pre-application conference (optional).
         (a)   Prior to filing a site plan review application, an applicant may
request a meeting with the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a pre-application
conference to provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed
development and to provide general guidance to assist in the preparation of a
formal site plan. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may invite additional city
staff or review agencies to participate in the discussion.
         (b)   An applicant may also request a pre-application meeting with
Planning Commission or City Council to discuss the concept of the proposed
development. The applicant may request such meeting by submitting a written
request, along with any supporting documents, to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
for placement on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting or any
special meeting that may be called by Planning Commission or City Council.
         (c)   No action can be taken by the administrative staff, Planning
Commission, or City Council until the applicant submits an actual site plan
application. Therefore, all discussions that occur between the applicant and/or
applicant’s representative(s) and staff, Planning Commission, or City Council
that occur prior to the submission of an actual application are not binding on
the city and do not constitute official assurances or representations by the
city or its officials regarding any aspects of the plan or application
discussed.
      (2)   Application,
         (a)   Applications for site plan review shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer with all fees and application content required
pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E).
         (b)   For developments also requiring conditional use approval,
applications for site plan review and conditional use permit review may be
submitted simultaneously.
         (c)   After determining a site plan application is complete, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall transmit copies of the site plan to individual
departments and agencies to solicit comments to be transmitted to the Planning
Commission prior to their review.
      (3)   Planning Commission review.
         (a)   The application shall be placed on the Planning Commission’s
next regularly scheduled meeting or at a special meeting, as may be necessary.
         (b)   Site plans shall be reviewed during a public meeting. No public
hearing shall be required unless the proposed use requires a conditional use
permit approval, which is to be reviewed concurrently, in which case, the site
plan review and approval shall take place under the procedure established in §
153.16(C).
         (c)   Within 45 days following the determination that the application
is complete, one of the following actions shall be taken:
            1.   Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed plan will constitute a suitable development and the plan meets the
standards set forth in this Zoning Code;
            2.   Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that
the proposed project does not meet the standards for review set forth in all
applicable chapters of this Zoning Code;
            3.   Approval of the site plan subject to any conditions,
modifications, and restrictions as required to guarantee that the project meets
the standards for review; or
            4.   Tabling of the site plan application for a period not to
exceed 90 days to provide the applicant additional time to address one or more
deficiencies identified in the site plan application.
         (d)   If the site plan is disapproved, the specific basis for such
disapproval shall be provided, along with a clear description of how the site
plan could be modified to be approved. Appeals from Planning Commission
decisions may be made in the manner specified in this section.
   (C)   Amendment to an approved site plan.
      (1)   Minor changes to approved site plans may be reviewed and decided by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer, provided such changes comply with all
applicable requirements of this Zoning Code and all other federal, state,
county or township laws and regulations.
      (2)   Major changes must be submitted to the Planning Commission for
review in the same manner as the original application was submitted or
reviewed. Major changes include but are not limited to:
         (a)   Increases in the scope or density of land use, land area, or
building size;
         (b)   The addition of uses and/or buildings not authorized by the
original approval;
         (c)   The rearrangement of lot lines or building locations by more
than five feet;
         (d)   Changes in the character or function of access drives;
         (e)   Significant changes in the concept of the development; or
         (f)   Any changes which the Zoning Enforcement Officer refuses or
fails to approve.
   (D)   Standards for site plan review. The following standards shall be
utilized by the Planning Commission in the review of all site plans. These
standards are intended to provide a frame of reference for the applicant in the
preparation of the site plans as well as for the Planning Commission in making
their decision. Site plans should demonstrate:
      (1)   Convenience and safety of both vehicular and pedestrian movement
within the site and in relationship to adjoining ways and properties.
      (2)   Provisions for the off-street loading and unloading of vehicles
incidental to the normal operation of the establishment; adequate parking,
adequate lighting, and internal traffic control.
      (3)   Reasonable demands placed on municipal services and infrastructure.
      (4)   Adequacy of methods for sewage and refuse disposal and the
protection from pollution of both surface water and groundwater. This includes
controlling soil erosion both during and after construction.
      (5)   Protection of abutting properties from any undue disturbance caused
by excessive or unreasonable noise, smoke, vapors, fumes, dust, odors, glare,
storm water runoff, and the like. The performance standards set forth in §
153.18(G) may apply to the site plan application.
      (6)   Minimizing the area over which existing vegetation is to be
removed. Where tree removal is required, special attention shall be given to
planting of replacement trees.
      (7)   The applicant's efforts to integrate the proposed development into
the existing landscape through design features such as vegetative buffers,
roadside planting, and the retention of open space.
      (8)   The building setbacks, area and location of parking, architectural
compatibility, signage, and landscaping of the development, and how these
features harmonize with the surrounding landscape.
   (E)   Site plan development standards. In addition to other standards from
this Zoning Code that may apply to the proposed development, the following
additional standards shall apply:
      (1)   Streetscape improvements.
         (a)   The applicant shall be required to install improvements along
the public street area of the subject site that conform to the city's
Streetscape Plan. These items may include pavers, sidewalks, street trees,
street lighting and planters consistent with the specifications found in the
Streetscape Plan.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may permit the applicant to make a
streetscape improvement payment-in-lieu request where one or all of the
required streetscape improvements are deemed to be premature relative to
adjacent property development or the status of the overall streetscape
construction phasing. In this event, the city shall transfer these monies to
the City Streetscape Improvement Fund and hold the funds for no more than five
years. The monies placed in this fund shall be used exclusively for streetscape
improvements benefitting the applicant's property. If the streetscape
improvements are not made within the five-year period, the city shall promptly
return those remaining streetscape improvement funds to the applicant.
      (2)   Outdoor lighting standards. The outdoor lighting guidelines shall
apply to all new projects and qualified expansion projects subject to this site
plan review process.
         (a)   Lighting must be placed and shielded so as to direct the light
onto the site and away from adjoining properties. The lighting source shall not
be directly visible from adjoining properties. Floodlights, wall pack units,
other types of unshielded lights, and lights where the lens is visible outside
of the light fixture shall be prohibited. Non-cutoff light fixtures shall be
prohibited. A decorative light pole and fixture utilizing a traditional design
style approved by the Planning Commission must be utilized for all lighting not
affixed to a structure.
         (b)   Sidewalks and parking areas shall be properly lighted to
facilitate the safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles and provide a secure
environment. In parking areas, the light intensity shall average a minimum of
0.5-foot candles, measured five feet above the surface. In pedestrian areas,
the light intensity shall average a minimum of 2.0 foot candles, measured five
feet above the surface. Lighting levels shall not exceed 0.5 foot-candles at
any common property line with property zoned or used for residential uses.
         (c)   All freestanding light poles and fixtures shall not exceed 20
feet.
         (d)   Any freestanding light pole and fixture shall be placed a
minimum of ten feet from any property line when proposed to be located adjacent
to a residential land use. There shall be no setback requirements for any
freestanding light poles and fixtures when abutting any non-residential land
use.
      (3)   Access control requirements. General standards for parking areas,
circulation, and access shall be incorporated as part of the site plan. These
standards are found in §
153.19. As part of the site plan review process, access shall be reviewed
relative to the distance from other drive approaches and from roadway
intersections. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is to
minimize or eliminate driveways by using service roads, rear access roads, or
shared driveways. The Planning Commission may, as part of the site plan review
process, require that existing driveways be moved, combined, re-aligned, or
eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
         (a)   As part of the site plan review process, the Planning Commission
may approve a site plan with a specific driveway location with the condition
that an agreement be first entered into between the property owner and the
city, requiring that if a service road is constructed in the future, or if the
opportunity for a shared driveway should present itself with development of
adjacent property, one or more approved driveways shall be closed and
measurements taken to utilize such service road or shared drive. Approval of
driveways may also include restrictions on turning movements, locations, or
other requirements to ensure safe and efficient traffic movement.
         (b)   When a service road is required, such improvement shall be
constructed by the developer of the involved property before any occupancy or
use of the parcel or structure is permitted. When a service road is provided,
all access to an adjacent property shall use that service road and no direct
access to the main thoroughfare shall be provided.
      (4)   Traffic impact study. A traffic impact study shall be a requirement
for site plan review if the expected trip generation of the land use is 100 or
more cars per hour as identified in the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE)
Manual. A traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional
engineer registered in the State of Ohio at the developer's expense. The
traffic impact study shall investigate the feasibility and benefits of
improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway movement limitations, and
other relevant information to the site to protect the safety of the traveling
public. The traffic impact study shall include the following elements:
         (a)   A description of the site and study area;
         (b)   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels;
         (c)   Trip generation and distribution, including a description of all
assumptions used to generate findings of trip distribution;
         (d)   Modal split, if applicable;
         (e)   Traffic assignment resulting from the development;
         (f)   Projected future traffic volumes;
         (g)   An assessment of the impact that would result from driveway
alternatives;
         (h)   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements
needed to maintain traffic flow within and past the site at an acceptable and
safe level of service; and
         (i)   An evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have
on the level of service and roadway capacity.
   (F)   Conformity to an approved site plan.
      (1)   Property subject to site plan approval must be developed in strict
compliance with the approved site plan, inclusive of any amendments, which have
received the approval of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If construction and development does not conform with the approved
site plan, the approval of the site plan shall be revoked by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer by written notice of the revocation being posted upon the
premises involved, and mailed to the owner at his or her last known address.
Upon revocation of this approval, all construction activities shall cease upon
the site until the time the violation has been corrected or the Planning
Commission has, upon a proper site plan application being filed by the owner,
approved a modification to the site plan to coincide with the owner's
construction, or altered plans for construction to be in compliance with the
criteria contained in the site plan approval provisions and with the spirit,
purpose, and intent of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Approval of the site plan shall be valid for a period of one year
beginning from the date of Planning Commission approval. If a building permit
has not been obtained and substantial on-site development actually commenced
within one year, the site plan approval shall become void and a new application
for site plan approval shall be required and new approval obtained before any
construction or site preparation work is commenced upon the site.
      (4)   The city shall require the posting of a surety bond, letter of
credit or other similar performance guarantee to ensure that required
infrastructure improvements within the public right-of-way are completed in the
event that the project is abandoned. The city may suspend the zoning permit
when work is not performed as required by an approved site plan.

district to allow maximum lot coverage for clustered sales space and
utilization of shared parking facilities. Land uses within this district shall
also include personal services, professional services and office uses that may
attract a non-local customer base while maintaining the appropriate development
scale and intensity desired for this district. Residential dwelling units
located above first floor retail or office uses shall also be encouraged to
assist in creating a residential critical market mass within the district.
Areas included in this district will be readily accessible via major and minor
arterial streets and shall be organized to facilitate nuisance-free circulation
of traffic and to avoid adverse impact on the utilization of adjacent areas.

Officer.
         (g)   Where appropriate, the use of awnings is encouraged. Awning
color and form should be consistent. Plexiglas, metal and glossy vinyl awning
are prohibited, while canvas, fabric, and matte finish vinyl awnings are
encouraged.
         (h)   The use of standardized corporate architectural styles
associated with chain restaurants and stores is discouraged. Effort should be

   (K)   Site design standards. Design and placement of new buildings in this
district must consider the existing built environment of the surrounding area,
in particular existing setbacks, building size and massing. Towards this end,
the following objectives should be considered:
      (1)   Buildings should be sited in a manner that complements adjacent
structures. Sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to provide order
and diversity and avoid an unplanned, confused development pattern.
      (2)   When a development site features multiple integrated buildings and
other structures, a visual link between separate buildings and structures
should be established, by various means, including stamped concrete walkways,
arcade systems, trellises or other open structures.
      (3)   Buildings should be sited to minimize conflicts between pedestrians
and vehicle traffic. Buildings can be linked to adjoining street sidewalks with
textured paving, landscaping and trellises.
      (4)   Outdoor spaces between buildings should be recognized as outdoor
"rooms" that have clear recognizable shapes, as opposed to being considered as
"left over" areas. These spaces can be used to provide important pedestrian
amenities such as benches, trellises, fountains, artwork, etc.
      (5)   Freestanding structures should be oriented with the main entry
towards the street and should have the main facade parallel to the street.
      (6)   Structures located on a corner lot shall orientate the primary
access and building entry in a manner that fronts the street corner when
feasible.

      (1)   Architectural standards. All new principal and accessory structures
permitted in this zoning district should be designed to conform to the
following architectural standards in order to achieve a uniform and well-
planned community appearance. As a category of structural types, industrial
buildings house a variety of uses or uses that maintain a high level of land
use intensity, and as such, often present unattractive and monotonous facades.
However, there are a variety of design techniques that can be utilized to
promote visual variety and facilitate a cohesive, attractive design statement:
         (a)   Avoid long, blank building facades, particularly on walls
visible form the public right-of-way. Facades with varied setbacks are
encouraged. If possible, wall planes should not run in one continuous direction
for more than 50 feet without an offset.
         (b)   All elevations to a building should be architecturally treated
to avoid monotonous overall design.
         (c)   Windows and doors are key elements of a building's form and
should relate to the scale of the facade on which they appear. Windows and
doors can help establish character by their rhythm, spacing, and variety.
Recessed openings further work to provide depth and contrast on elevation
planes.
         (d)   Metal buildings should be architecturally designed, providing
variety and visual interest to the streetscape.
         (e)   All roof-mounted equipment shall be screened from public view by
materials similar to those used in the overall structure. Mechanical equipment
should be located below the highest vertical element of the building. Rooftop
solar panels may be visible from public view provided the connections securing
the solar panels to the rooftop are approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         (f)   Building entries shall be readily identifiable through the use
of canopies, marquees and architectural treatment.
         (g)   It is encouraged that the front and two side elevations of all
buildings and structures be constructed of brick, architectural block or
architectural precast concrete. Painted or natural utility concrete panels or
masonry units should be confined to rear elevations and in loading dock areas
where applicable.
         (h)   Glass windows or some similar architectural treatment shall
occupy at least 10% of the front elevation of a building.
         (i)   Design elements which are undesirable and should be avoided
include:
            1.   Highly reflective surfaces;
            2.   Large blank, unarticulated wall surfaces; and
            3.   Exposed, treated block walls.
      (2)   Exterior building materials. All principal buildings and accessory
structures in the C-1 District shall be subject to the same exterior material
standards as the R-1 District. See §
153.09(J)(2).
      (3)   Nonconforming structures. Principal buildings that do not conform
to these architectural and building material standards on the date these
standards became effective shall be considered nonconforming. Any such building
damaged to the extent of 50% or greater of its fair market value shall be
required to be reconstructed in compliance with these standards in accordance
with §
153.21.

site.
   (R)   Site design standards. Design and placement of new buildings in this
district must consider the existing built environment of the surrounding area,
in particular existing setbacks, building size and massing. Towards this end,
the following objectives should be considered:
      (1)   Buildings should be sited in a manner that compliments adjacent
structures. Sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to provide order
and diversity and avoid an unplanned, confused development pattern.

other structures, a visual link between separate buildings and structures
should be established, by various means, including stamped concrete walkways,
arcade systems, trellises or other open structures.
      (3)   Buildings should be sited to minimize conflicts between pedestrians
and vehicle traffic. Buildings can be linked to adjoining street sidewalks with
textured paving, landscaping and trellises.
      (4)   Outdoor spaces between buildings should be recognized as outdoor
"rooms" that have clear recognizable shapes, as opposed to being considered as
"left over" areas. These spaces can be used to provide important pedestrian
amenities such as benches, trellises, fountains, artwork, etc.
   (S)   Applications subject to review.

§ 153.15 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD).
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   It is the purpose and intent of this Planned Unit Development
District (PUD) to permit and encourage the orderly, cooperative, and flexible
development and expansion of certain medical, office, retail, and residential
land uses in a planned environment. It is further the intent of this district:
         (a)   To insure compatible relationships between land use activities;
         (b)   To insure the compatible orientation of one building to another
in regard to building bulk, architecture and open space;
         (c)   To provide for visually pleasing and functional treatment of
open areas;
         (d)   To provide for an efficient and safe circulation system for
pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles;
         (e)   To provide adequate and flexible parking space for immediate and
future needs;
         (f)   To ensure that signs are adequate, but properly controlled to
prevent them from detracting from the appearance of the development;
         (g)   To encourage cooperation among individual owners, and/or
developers to achieve the above listed objectives;
         (h)   To permit flexibility of design in the placement and use of
buildings and open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas,
and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site characterized by special
features of geography, topography, size or shape; and
         (i)   To provide flexibility in the application of certain provisions
of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Because of the special characteristics of a PUD, special provisions
governing the development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there
is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this section and those of
other sections in this chapter, the provisions of this section shall prevail
for the development of land for PUD developments.
   (B)   Scope and applicability.
      (1)   The intent of the PUD regulations is to provide a means for
applying comprehensive and flexible planning and design techniques on
properties substantially sized to accommodate such a plan. As such, the minimum
size of any PUD project or plan shall be one acre.
      (2)   Any Planned Unit Development District (PUD), Planned Institutional
Development District (PID), or Planned Mixed Use Development District (PMUD)
approved prior to the effective date of this amendment shall carry forward with
the approved plans and be considered a PUD. All future construction or changes
in previously approved PUDs, PIDs, or PMUDs shall comply with the applicable
approved plan unless a modification is required, in which case, the
modification shall be reviewed in accordance with this section.
   (C)   Project ownership. The project land may be owned, leased, or
controlled by a single person or corporation, or by a group of individuals or
corporations. Such ownership may be by a public or private corporation.
   (D)   Application procedure; zoning approval process. Whenever PUD is
proposed, before a permit for the erection of a permanent building in such PUD
shall be granted, and before a subdivision plat of any part thereof may be
filed in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, the applicant or their
authorized agent shall apply for and secure approval of such PUD in accordance
with the following procedures:
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting Required.
         (a)   Prior to filing an application for a PUD, an applicant shall
meet with the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a pre-application conference to
provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed development and to
provide general guidance to assist in the preparation of a formal site plan.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer may invite additional city staff or review
agencies to participate in the discussion.
         (b)   An applicant may also request a pre-application meeting with
Planning Commission or City Council to discuss the concept of the proposed
development. The applicant may request such meeting by submitting a written
request, along with any supporting documents, to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
for placement on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting or any
special meeting that may be called by Planning Commission or City Council.
         (c)   No action can be taken by the administrative staff, Planning
Commission, or City Council until the applicant submits an PUD application.
Therefore, all discussions that occur between the applicant and/or applicant’s
representative(s) and staff, Planning Commission, or City Council that occur
prior to the submission of an actual application are not binding on the city
and do not constitute official assurances or representations by the city or its
officials regarding any aspects of the plan or application discussed.
      (2)   Step 2 – PUD Development Plan and Zoning Map Amendment Review.
         (a)   Application.
            1.   Applications for a PUD shall be submitted to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer with all fees and application content required pursuant to
§
153.02(D) and (E).
            2.   After determining a PUD application is complete, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall transmit copies of the plans to individual
departments and agencies to solicit comments to be transmitted to the Planning
Commission prior to their review.
         (b)   PUD Development Agreement Submission. As part of the information
to be transmitted to the Planning Commission, the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall provide the Planning Commission with a draft of the PUD Development
Agreement. The development agreement will provide for various development
related items, including, but not limited to:
            1.   PUD waivers as mutually negotiated between the city and the
applicant;
            2.   Operational details of the proposed uses for the site;
            3.   Site inspection details and procedure;
            4.   Project construction phasing details; and
            5.   Any other details relevant to the timing and construction of
the proposed development as agreed upon by the city and the applicant.
         (c)   PUD Development Plan Review and Zoning Map Amendment Review.
            1.   The PUD Development Plan approval procedure involves a zoning
map amendment to rezone the subject property to a PUD with an approved PUD
Development Plan.
            2.   The procedure for this stage shall comply with the
requirements of §
153.02(F).
            3.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review procedure,
the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to review the PUD
Development Plan and make a recommendation to City Council to approve, approve
with modifications, or deny the application. The recommendation shall be made
based on review of the application using the criteria contained in §
153.15(E). The Planning Commission may, in its recommendation to City Council,
authorize that zoning permit applications (Step 3) may be submitted in stages
upon evidence assuring completion of the entire development in accordance with
the PUD Development Plan and a phased development schedule.
            4.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review procedure,
City Council shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Development Plan and PUD
zoning map amendment and decide to approve, approve with modifications, or deny
the recommendation of the Planning Commission using the criteria contained in §
153.15(E).
            5.   In making its recommendations or decisions, the Planning
Commission and/or City Council may impose such conditions of approval as are in
its judgment necessary to insure conformity to the applicable criteria and
standards of this zoning code and to the Comprehensive Plan. In so doing, the
Planning Commission and/or City Council may require that the applicant to
revise the plan and resubmit it as a PUD Development Plan within 60 days of
such action.
         (d)   PUD Development Agreement Action.
            1.   As part of the PUD Development Plan review and decision, the
City Council shall also act on the PUD Development Agreement. Upon an approval
of the PUD Development Plan, the applicant shall cause the final PUD
Development Agreement document to be recorded at the Hamilton County Recorder's
office no later than 90 days upon the date the PUD zoning map amendment is
legal as evidenced by the running of the mandatory 45-day referendum period.
            2.   In the event a valid referendum petition has been submitted
and the question is certified as a ballot issue being placed on the next
eligible general election, the applicant shall not have the responsibility to
record the PUD Development Agreement document until such time as the PUD may be
approved by the voters at the next eligible general election.
      (3)   Step 3 – Zoning Permit Review.
         (a)   Zoning permits shall be required for any PUD development
activities, as established in §
153.02(G).
         (b)   The applicant may submit a zoning permit application after
approval of the PUD Development Plan and zoning map amendment, however, no such
permit may be issued during the mandatory 45-day referendum period.
         (c)   A zoning permit shall not be issued until the lot or applicable
subdivision has been fully recorded in the office of the Hamilton County
Recorder’s Office, and public improvements have been installed in accordance
with the applicable subdivision regulations.
         (d)   Zoning permits shall only be issued when the application
demonstrates compliance with the approved PUD Development Plan.
   (E)   PUD review criteria and factors for consideration. The Planning
Commission and City Council may call upon other public and/or private

      (2)   In general, any standards that apply to a specific use in this code
shall also apply to those same uses in a PUD. However, the Planning Commission
and City Council may adjust or waive any of those use-specific standards as
part of the PUD Development Plan approval based on unique circumstances
specific to the applicable development.
      (3)   As part of any approval, the Planning Commission and/or City
Council may restrict the uses permitted within an individual PUD by adopting a
list of uses permitted within the PUD, particularly for nonresidential
buildings where uses may change in the future.
      (4)   Any changes in uses within an approved PUD shall be required to be
reviewed as part of a major PUD amendment.
      (5)   The following uses are explicitly prohibited from being established
in a PUD District:
         (a)   Single-family detached dwellings;
         (b)   Drive-thru or drive-in restaurants;
         (c)   Gas stations unless secondary and accessory to another principal
use;
         (d)   Free-standing pharmacies that are not located in a building
containing a principal use. Pharmacies that are accessory to another principal
use, and where the pharmacy is located within the building are permitted; and
         (e)   Any use that the Zoning Enforcement Officer determines is not
listed as a permitted use or a conditionally permitted use in any other zoning
district (i.e., not listed as allowed anywhere in the city).
   (I)   Permitted accessory uses. Any accessory use that the Zoning
Enforcement Officer determines to be a traditional accessory use to a principal
use allowed in the PUD.
   (J)   Development standards. This PUD District allows for a master planned
blend of commercial and residential uses within a property, area, or building.
Development proposed under this PUD District shall comply with the development
standards herein and any other applicable zoning regulation or standard
provided in this Zoning Code, unless specifically waived by the Planning
Commission and City Council as part of the review process. The Planning
Commission and City Council shall have the authority to waive any zoning
requirement as part of the PUD Development Plan approval. Development standards
shall include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Minimum lot size. There shall be no specific minimum lot area
required in a PUD District except that there shall be sufficient area to
satisfy any off-street parking loading or landscaping requirements as
established in this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Height. Structures shall provide for adequate light and air, and
shall provide for considerations of solar access from adjacent properties. The
maximum height of a principal structure located in this district shall be 55
feet and contain no more than five occupied stories.
      (3)   Density. The maximum density of a development shall be set by the
approval of the PUD Development Plan. In general, the following guidelines
shall apply:
         (a)   Densities shall reflect the recommendations of the Silverton
Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   Residential density of PUDs surrounded by R-1 Districts shall
not exceed five units per acre.
         (c)   Residential densities of PUDs surrounded by R-1 and R-
2 Districts shall not exceed 12 units per acre.
         (d)   Residential densities that are adjacent to nonresidential zoning
districts shall not exceed 16 units per acre.
         (e)   Planning Commission and City Council may approve increased
densities from those established above based on the specific design of the PUD
and the provision of adequate buffering from less intense uses.
      (4)   Setbacks.
         (a)   Principal buildings may have a build-to line of zero feet except
that the front or corner side street facades of such buildings may be set back
to accommodate pedestrian oriented outdoor uses and amenities, as determined
are appropriate to an urban setting, such as outdoor patio dining areas, plazas
and courtyards, fountains, public art, entry forecourts, and landscaping.
         (b)   The scale and relationship to the development pattern of
adjoining property shall be used to evaluate the required setback. Design
emphasis shall be placed on enhancing a pedestrian environment with adequate
sidewalk width, street trees, and pedestrian scaled signs and building facades.
         (c)   The PUD review process shall be used to assure that buildings
are designed and oriented on lots to provide adequate light and air, assure
sufficient distance between adjoining uses to minimize any incompatibility, and
to promote excellence of development.
         (d)   The PUD shall be designed to have sufficient setbacks and
buffering between adjacent properties with a less intense use.
      (5)   Yards/setbacks.
         (a)   Buildings with ground floor residential uses shall have a
maximum front yard and corner side yard of ten feet to accommodate stairs,
landings, porches, covered architectural entry features, and similar building
features.
         (b)   When provided, the front or corner side yard shall include
landscaping or a hard-surface expansion of the sidewalk. Walkway connections to
building entrances shall include special paving treatment or materials. The use
of awnings, canopies, and arcades shall be incorporated as appropriate to
provide visual interest, shade, and protection of pedestrians from the
elements.
         (c)   All other buildings shall generally have no required yard and be
located adjacent to the sidewalk to facilitate pedestrian access to the public
realm. Portions of the front or corner-side street facades may be set back to
allow for pedestrian-oriented outdoor areas and amenities only, such as plazas
and courtyards, outdoor patio dining areas, public art, fountains, entry
forecourts, landscaping, or other amenities appropriate to an urban setting.
When provided, such yards shall generally be no more than ten feet, except
where ground floor building space is occupied by retail or other pedestrian-
oriented uses with entrances opening directly to a plaza or courtyard. In such
cases, the plans may allow for the maximum front or corner-side yard to be
extended.
      (6)   Lot coverage. There shall be no specific maximum lot coverage in
this zoning district except as follows:
         (a)   Sufficient space shall be provided to satisfy off-street parking
and loading area requirements;
         (b)   Undeveloped areas and redeveloped areas shall be designed with
low impact development principals where possible; and
         (c)   Standards for open space are met.
      (7)   General site planning. The location of structures and other site
improvements shall create a pedestrian-oriented environment with safe,
pleasant, convenient, and accessible pedestrian routes to public sidewalks,
transit facilities, and adjacent uses. Site planning shall incorporate the
following when feasible:
         (a)   Structures shall be sited along street frontages of sites with
parking in the rear or in limited circumstances to the side. Placing parking
areas behind rather than in front of buildings helps preserve an attractive
streetscape and improves pedestrian access to surrounding activities and uses.
It also provides an urban border for the street.
         (b)   Placement of structures, entrances, and open space areas, such
as plazas and courtyards, shall be oriented to provide direct access to public
sidewalks, and provide midblock corridors and streets to the maximum extent
possible to facilitate pedestrian access and movement between adjacent uses.
         (c)   Buildings shall be arranged to create a sense of unity and
overall harmony with adjacent structures. A visual link between separate
structures can be established through the use of an arcade system, trellis, or
similar feature.
         (d)   Buildings shall be sited in a manner that maximizes visibility
of plazas, courtyards, streets, and alleys to provide opportunities for people
engaged in their normal behavior to observe the spaces around them.
         (e)   The location of outdoor spaces shall have clear, recognizable
shapes that reflect careful planning and are not simply left over areas between
structures. Such spaces shall provide pedestrian-oriented amenities such as
shaded areas, art, benches, fountains, landscaping, and the like.
      (8)   Privacy for residences.
         (a)   Windows should be oriented away from loading, service, recycling
and solid waste disposal areas.
         (b)   Views from public right-of-way or other businesses or residences
into primary living areas should be avoided by:
            1.   Locating residences on the upper floor(s);
            2.   Orienting windows away from other adjacent windows;
            3.   Using translucent, louvered or offset windows;
            4.   Incorporating privacy screening with landscaping, fencing or
in combination with garden walls for outside private open space areas.
         (c)   To the extent residential windows face the windows of an
adjacent dwelling unit, the windows shall be offset or incorporate other
features to provide privacy.
      (9)   Mixed use buildings programming. Where there is a mix of uses in a
single structure that includes residential uses, the ground floor land uses
situated along public street frontage shall include permitted nonresidential
uses only. Permitted ground floor residential uses situated along public street
frontage may be permitted if approved by the Planning Commission. Residential
dwellings, storage and parking should be oriented at the rear or interior
building frontages. Residential dwellings may be allowed above the first floor
or to the rear or side of the commercial use on the ground floor.
         (a)   The main building entrance or entrances shall be oriented to the
street or plazas, as applicable, to maximize natural surveillance and provide
"eyes on the street." The main entries to buildings shall be clearly
demarcated, visible and accessible from the street or pedestrian walkways. Main
entries shall be recessed or framed by a sheltering element such as an awning,
arcade, porch, or portico. Such entrances shall open directly to the outside
and shall not require a pedestrian to first pass through a garage, parking lot,
or loading area to gain access to the entrance from the street. Secondary
building entries may be from parking areas.
         (b)   All residential dwellings fronting on streets shall have a main
entrance opening onto the front or corner side facade of the dwelling at the
ground floor level. Such an entrance shall open directly to the outside. The
entrance may be above grade level through a porch, stoop, portico, or similar
architectural feature. Ground floor single-family attached dwellings fronting
on a street shall have separate entries directly from the sidewalk or a
pedestrian walkway. Upper story and ground floor residential dwelling units in
a multifamily or mixed-use building fronting on streets may share one or more
entries accessible directly from the street.
         (c)   Multifamily residential buildings with facades over 150 feet in
length facing a street frontage shall provide a minimum of two or more
pedestrian building entrances on that frontage.
         (d)   Entrances to residential units shall be physically separated
from the entrance to the permitted commercial uses and clearly marked with a
physical feature incorporated into the building or an appropriately scaled
element applied to the facade.
         (e)   Structures and buildings with ground floor residential uses
shall have a front and corner side yards of at least five feet, but no greater
than ten feet. Stairs, landings, patios, unenclosed porches and architectural
entry features, landscaping and similar features may occupy such yards.
      (10)   Mass, scale and facade.
         (a)   The mass and scale of a new development shall be compatible with
adjacent neighborhoods and surrounding developments and not overwhelm them with
disproportionate size or a design that is out of character or obstructs solar
access.
         (b)   Building scale shall be reduced through the proper use of window
patterns, structural bays, roof overhangs, awnings, moldings, fixtures, and
other details that promote a human scale.
         (c)   Building design shall avoid large monotonous facades, long
straight-line building fronts, plain box shapes, and barren exterior treatment.
All building facades visible from streets or public areas such as plazas shall
be highly articulated, and incorporate the chosen design theme in a consistent
manner.
      (11)   Pedestrian orientation.
         (a)   Windows on public street frontages should be at a height that
enables pedestrians to easily view retail products and services within the
building.
         (b)   Darkly tinted and mirrored windows that obstruct two-way
visibility are prohibited on the ground floor facing streets and pedestrian
corridors.
         (c)   Pedestrian linkages between buildings and uses shall include
features such as walkways, corner entrances, paseos, outdoor patios, water
features, benches and tangible public art in mixed-use developments.
      (12)   Treatment adjacent to residential districts.
         (a)   To provide privacy for adjacent dwelling units, windows on the
second and higher floors of buildings, which directly face or abut residential
zones, should be designed either as translucent, louvered, offset from existing
residential windows, or utilizing another solution to achieve privacy for the
adjacent dwelling units.
         (b)   Parking areas shall be located and designed to be convenient in
order to minimize parking problems in adjacent residential neighborhoods.
         (c)   Building facades and garages that face existing dwelling units
shall be designed to be compatible with the setbacks and scale of the existing
development.
      (13)   Signs. Signs shall be allowed in accordance with §
153.22 unless otherwise modified through the PUD Development Plan approval.
      (14)   Other site development standards.
         (a)   All public and private utility facilities and structures
required to be newly constructed or relocated as a result of the project shall
be placed underground within the project area and within any public right-of-
way located adjacent to the project boundaries. Appurtenances to these systems
which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement if it
is determined that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of
the proposed planned development.
         (b)   All external light fixtures and mounting structures shall
conform to the standards set for in §
153.06(E)(2).
         (c)   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access
shall be incorporated as part of the site plan following the standards set
forth in §
153.06(E)(3) including those applicable off-street parking and loading
facilities standards contained in §
153.19.
         (d)   A traffic impact study shall be a requirement for the PUD
Development Plan application if the expected trip generation of the land use is
100 or more cars per hour as identified in the Institute of Traffic Engineers
(ITE) Manual. The proposed project's land uses as provided for on the Stage II
Preliminary Development Plan shall be used to calculate any traffic impact
study analysis. The traffic impact study standards set forth in §
153.06(E)(4) shall apply.
         (e)   All permitted uses in the PUD district must be conducted within
completely enclosed buildings unless otherwise expressly authorized. This
requirement does not apply to off-street parking or loading areas, automated
teller machines, or outdoor seating areas.
   (K)   Architectural and exterior material standards.
      (1)   Architectural standards.
         (a)   All new principal and accessory structures permitted in this
zoning district should be designed to conform to the following architectural
standards in order to achieve a uniform and well-planned community appearance.
         (b)   As a category of structural types, nonresidential buildings may
house a variety of uses or uses that maintain a high level of land use
intensity, and as such, often present unattractive and monotonous facades.
However, there are a variety of design techniques that can be utilized to
promote visual variety and facilitate a cohesive, attractive design statement:
            1.   Avoid long, blank building facades, particularly on walls
visible from the public right-of-way. Facades with varied setbacks are
encouraged, if possible, wall planes should not run in one continuous direction
for more than 50 feet without an offset.
            2.   All elevations to a building should be architecturally treated
to avoid monotonous overall design.
            3.   Window and doors are key elements of a building's form and
should relate to the scale of the facade on which they appear. Windows and
doors can help establish character by their rhythm, spacing, and variety.
Recessed openings further work to provide depth and contrast on elevation
planes.
            4.   Metal buildings should be architecturally designed, providing
variety and visual interest to the streetscape.
            5.   All roof-mounted equipment should be screened from public view
by materials similar to those used in the overall structure. Mechanical
equipment should be located below the highest vertical element of the building.
            6.   Building entries should be readily identifiable through the
use of canopies, marquees and architectural treatment.
            7.   Glass windows or some similar architectural treatment should
occupy at least 10% of the front elevation of a building.
            8.   Design elements which are undesirable and should be avoided
include:
               a.   Highly reflective surfaces.
               b.   Large blank, unarticulated wall surfaces.
               c.   Exposed, treated block walls.
      (2)   Exterior building materials. All principal buildings and accessory
structures in PUD shall be subject to the same exterior material standards as
the R-1 District, unless waived by the Planning Commission and City Council as
part of the PUD Development Plan approval. See §
153.09(J)(2).
   (L)   Common open space.
      (1)   A minimum of 5% of the total land area developed in any PUD project
shall be reserved for common open space for the users of the area being
developed.
      (2)   Functional use of open space should be developed in favor of
placement of landscaping in unusable areas or passive landscape area.
      (3)   The design of the common usable open space shall complement the
street pedestrian realm with plazas, pocket parks, public gathering spaces,
street furniture, multi-purpose drainage facilities and landscaping.
      (4)   Nonresidential and mixed-use projects are encouraged to incorporate
plazas and courtyards, which are oriented to the public realm/sidewalks, into
their design. Buildings may be clustered to create usable pedestrian areas.
      (5)   The design shall provide visual and physical cues that demark the
public space from the private space.
      (6)   To integrate new buildings within the surrounding area, such
buildings are encouraged to provide passageways that allow for light and air to
adjacent buildings.
      (7)   In mixed-use residential and residential projects, common usable
open space shall be provided in large, meaningful areas that are visible from
the residential dwellings they serve.
      (8)   Common open space areas shall be convenient to the majority of
dwellings and shall contain amenities appropriate to the project's size.
      (9)   In mixed use and residential projects, private usable open space
shall be contiguous to the dwelling unit it serves and be screened from public
view for privacy. All balconies and patios that front a public street shall be
designed to screen items being stored on the balcony or patio.
      (10)   Rooftop open space may be used as common usable open space or
private usable open space, when directly accessible to the dwelling unit(s) it
serves.
      (11)   Disposition of open space. The required amount of common open
space reserved under a planned unit development shall either be held in
corporate ownership by owners of the project area for the use of each owner who
buys property within the development, or be dedicated to the city and retained
as common open space for parks, recreation and related uses. All land dedicated
to the city must meet the Planning Commission's requirements as to size, shape,
and location. Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way, for water
courses and other similar channels, are not acceptable for common open space
dedication to the city, unless such land or right-of-way is useable as a trail
or other similar purpose and approved by the Planning Commission. City Council
shall have the discretion to accept or deny any common open space proposed to
be dedicated to the city.
      (12)   Maintenance of open space. The responsibility for the maintenance
of all open spaces shall be specified by the developer as part of the
Development Agreement.
   (M)   Utility requirements. All public and private utility facilities and
structures required to be newly constructed or relocated as a result of the
project shall be placed underground within the project area and within any
public right-of-way located adjacent to the project boundaries. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this
requirement if the Planning Commission finds that such exemption will not
violate the intent or character of the proposed planned unit development.
   (N)   Financial responsibility for public improvements. No building permits
or zoning permits shall be issued for construction within a PUD until required
public improvements are installed or performance bond posted in accordance with
the same procedures as provided for by the City Engineer. Other such
requirements may also be established from time to time by the City Engineer.
   (O)   Public improvements security. If the applicant is required to install
any public infrastructure at a condition of an approved plan or Development
Agreement under this PUD section, the city shall require the posting of a
surety bond, letter of credit or other similar performance guarantee to ensure
that required infrastructure improvements within the public right-of-way are
completed in the event that the project is abandoned. This security must be
established prior to a zoning permit or building permit being issued. The city
may suspend the zoning permit when work is not performed as required by an
approved PUD plan.

§ 153.16 CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the procedure for
approval of uses conditionally permitted under the provisions of the various
districts created by this chapter. These divisions are necessary because of the
considerable impact certain uses which might be appropriate in the district
might have on other permitted uses.
   (B)   Application for conditional use. Applications for a conditional use
permit shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer with all fees and
application content required pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E).
   (C)   Conditional use permit procedure.
      (1)   Prior to authorizing a conditional use, the Planning Commission
shall conduct a public hearing after notice of said hearing has been given in
accordance with §
153.03(E). The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue a conditional use permit
for the conditional use following the hearing and upon an affirmative vote by
the Planning Commission that such conditional use satisfies the requirements of
this section.
      (2)   The Planning Commission, as part of an affirmative vote, is
authorized to attach reasonable conditions to a conditional use permit
application to meet the overall spirit and intent of the zoning district for
which the conditional use is proposed to be located, and to comply with the
objectives of this Zoning Code and the Silverton Comprehensive Plan.
   (D)   Appeals of decisions concerning conditional use permits. Appeals of
decisions made by the Planning Commission concerning conditional use permits
shall be made in writing to the Board of Zoning Appeals within 30 days from the
date of the official Planning Commission decision to either approve or
disapprove the conditional use application. In reviewing conditional use
decisions by the Planning Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall apply
the general conditional use standards and the applicable specific conditional
use standards provided for in this section.
   (E)   General standards applicable to consideration of conditional uses. In
reviewing the applications for conditional use permits, the Planning Commission
shall consider whether there is adequate evidence that the proposed
conditionally permitted use is consistent with the following standards:
      (1)   The proposed use is a conditional use as established under the
provisions of district use regulations;
      (2)   The proposed use will be harmonious with and in accordance with the
general objectives or with any specific objective of the Comprehensive Plan and
Zoning Code of the city;
      (3)   The proposed use will be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained in a manner harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      (4)   The proposed use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or
future neighborhood uses;
      (5)   The proposed use will be served adequately by essential public
facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection,
drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the
persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall
be able to provide adequately any of those services;
      (6)   The proposed use will not create excessive additional requirements
at public cost for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community;
      (7)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment, and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to
any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors;
      (8)   The proposed use will have vehicular approaches to the property
which shall be so designed as not to create an interference with traffic on
surrounding public thoroughfares;
      (9)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
      (10)   When applicable, minimum standards for parking and loading shall
be as required in the off-street parking and loading facilities section of this
Zoning Code;
      (11)   When applicable, parking areas shall not encroach upon any
bufferyard required in the landscape and bufferyard standards section of this
Zoning Code;
      (12)   When applicable, minimum standards for landscaping shall be as
required in the landscaping and bufferyard standards section; and
      (13)   When applicable, minimum standards for architectural or exterior
material requirements and site design guidelines provided for in the zoning
district for which the proposed conditional use may be located shall apply.
   (F)   Specific standards for certain conditional use. The following minimum
requirements shall be imposed on certain specified conditional uses. All
conditional uses are subject to the general standards identified in division
(E), above, and the lack of specific standards in this section shall not imply
a lack of standards at all. Additional requirements may be imposed by the
Planning Commission if deemed appropriate to meet the spirit and intent of this
Zoning Code and the Silverton Comprehensive Plan. In granting any conditional
use, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. Violations of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use
is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
      (1)   Automated teller machines (ATMs).
         (a)   No stand-alone automated teller machine structure nor any
portion of an automated teller machine constructed as part of a building facade
shall exceed 15 feet in height.
         (b)   All structures and activity areas, except off-street parking,
shall be located no less than 50 feet from all lot lines abutting any
residential zoning district and no less than 35 feet from all lot lines
abutting non-residential zoning districts.
         (c)   The Planning Commission may require that a photometric analysis
be provided in order to ensure that the foot candle measurement at any property
line abutting against any residential use or zoning district does not exceed
0.5-foot candles.
      (2)   Automobile sales.
         (a)   The minimum lot size shall be four acres.

converted to another use.
         (k)   As a condition of approval under this section, an automobile
gasoline or service station shall provide a performance bond to the city in an
amount equal to the estimated removal cost of any underground storage
containers or other site element remediation or abatement that may require
specific costs to fully bring the site in full compliance with all local, state
and federal environmental laws and guidelines. Such performance bond must
remain in effect until the site ceases to be used as an automobile gasoline or
service station. Changes in ownership of the property and/or the business
entity shall require the submission of a new or modified performance bond to
the city within 30 days upon change of ownership.
         (l)   The following shall regulate the abandonment of automobile
gasoline and automobile service stations:
            1.   If any automotive gasoline or service station is abandoned for
a period of at least six consecutive months, such station shall be presumed to
be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values and to be
detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, property or
general welfare of the community and shall be abated.
            2.   Such abandoned condition shall be abated within 60 days either
by placing the station in operation in accordance with this section and other
applicable laws and regulations of the city and state, adopting and using the
building or structure for another permitted use in the district in which it is
located, or by razing the station, removing the pumps and signs, abandoning the

§ 153.17 ACCESSORY USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. In addition to the principal uses expressly included in the
zoning districts such use types shall be deemed to include such accessory uses
which are specifically identified by these accessory use regulations; and such
other accessory uses which are necessarily and customarily associated with, and
are appropriate, incidental, and subordinate to, such principal uses. When
provided by these regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer to determine if a proposed accessory use is necessarily and
customarily associated with, and is appropriate, incidental, and subordinate to
the principal use, based on the Zoning Enforcement Officer's evaluation of the
resemblance of the proposed accessory use to those uses specifically identified
as accessory to the principal uses and the relationship between the proposed
accessory use and the principal use.
   (B)   Zoning permit required. Unless otherwise expressly stated, a zoning
permit shall be required for the construction or establishment of an accessory
use or structure.
   (C)   Accessory use standards. In all districts, except as specified in each

the ground where located, which shall be of such design and construction as to
effectively prevent a child from crawling or otherwise passing through or under
such barrier. Rails are not permitted in place of a wall or fence. Such fence
or other barrier shall be of conventional design and each gate in it shall be
provided with a self-closing, self-latching gate with secure lock and shall be
kept locked at all times, unless such pool is under the immediate observation
and supervision of a responsible person. The latch shall not be lower than 48
inches and located on the inside of the gate, not accessible to a small child.
In the case of pools which are partially or completely above-ground, in lieu of
a fence or other permissible barrier, the outside structure of the pool wall
may constitute part of the conventional barrier but must have a permissible
topper-barrier, so that the complete barrier, measured from the adjacent grade
or the highest point of access to the pool, is not less than 72 inches or six
feet. The steps or ladder can be designed to be secured, locked or removed to
prevent access, or the steps or ladder can be surrounded by and completely
enclosed by a fence or other permissible barrier with gate as stated above.

completion date of the project shall require a zoning permit authorized by the
Planning Commission.
   (E)   Fence and wall regulations. Fences, walls, plant materials designed in
a manner similar to a fence, and similar screening devices shall be subject to
the following:
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, the terms “fence,” shall include
walls, plant materials designed in a manner similar to a fence (e.g., hedge),
and similar screening devices, and all are subject to the standards of this
section.
      (2)   Fences are prohibited in the front yard. See §
153.08(B)(4) for information on the location of the front yard.

the fence that faces outward from the lot or yard being fenced. If a fence has
two similarly finished sides, either side may face the adjacent property.
      (7)   All electric and barbed wire fences shall be prohibited.
      (8)   All fences shall be properly maintained by the owners of the
property on which they are located. Such maintenance shall include painting,
cleaning, and structural soundness in the case of a fence, wall, or other man-
made object; and trimming, pruning, cutting, and other landscaping in the case
of a hedge or other planting so that there is no aesthetic detriment to the
surrounding area.
      (9)   All fences, regardless of type or height, require an approved fence
permit on a form provided by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, and including all
applicable fees. Fence permits shall be reviewed in the same manner as a zoning
permit.
      (10)   It shall be the duty of each lot owner and contractor, or an agent
thereof, to determine lot lines and to ascertain that the fence does not
deviate from the plans as approved by the Zoning Enforcement Office issuing the
permit, and that the fence does not encroach on another lot or existing
easement. The issuance of the permit and any inspection by the city shall not
be construed to mean that the city has determined the fence is not encroaching
on another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed on
him or her herein.
      (11)   Fences shall not impede, inhibit, or obstruct culverts, drains,
natural watercourses, or storm water drainage in any zoning district. Fences
may be permitted to include outlets at the bottom of the fence or wall to
eliminate the possibility of the accumulation of water and allow for natural
drainage past the wall or fence.
      (12)   Walls shall be prohibited within all utility easements. Fences
that are placed in utility easements shall require the written permission from
the applicable utility and without such permission, are subject to removal
without notice by utility companies or the city when work is being done in the

expense.
   (F)   Architectural projections. Open structures such as fireplace chases,
porches, canopies, balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios, and similar
architectural projections shall be considered parts of the building to which
they are attached and shall not project into the required minimum front, side,
or rear yards.
   (G)   Performance standards. It is the purpose of the performance standards
to provide for the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of property and to set forth
regulations so that no use shall be constructed or operated so as to create a
nuisance or to create any noxious, objectionable or other undesirable effect on
persons or property outside of the lot line of said use. Materials, uses and
products produced shall be adequately housed, shielded or screened so that the
health, safety and welfare of persons occupying the property or adjacent
properties are not jeopardized.
      (1)   Applicability and compliance. The performance standards are
applicable to all land uses in all zoning districts within the city, and both
initial and continued compliance is required. Any condition or land use falling
under the jurisdiction of the standards of this Zoning Code and not in
conformance with these standards shall be brought into full compliance
immediately upon discontinuance of the existing use of land, structure or
building. Any change in the principal use of land, a structure or a building
shall constitute a discontinuance and be fully subject to these standards and
provisions.
      (2)   Noise. No business or commercial operation or residential use shall
create a persistent or recurring noise which is a nuisance. No business or
commercial operation or residential use may raise the noise level more than two
decibels above the normal background level (measured at any lot line).
      (3)   Odors. No use shall cause or allow the emission of odorous air
contaminants from any source sufficient to result in detectable odors beyond
any lot line on which the use occurs.
      (4)   Vibrations. Every use shall be so operated that ground vibration
inherently and recurrently generated is not perceptible, without instruments,
at any point on or outside the property line of the property on which the use
is located.
      (5)   Glare and heat. Any operation producing intense light or heat,
including high temperature processes such as combustion or welding, shall not
be visible or felt beyond any lot line bounding the property wherein the use is
conducted. All exterior lighting on private property shall be positioned as to
extend glare away from adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.
      (6)   Air and water pollutants. The emission of air and water pollutants
shall not violate the standards and regulations of any local, state or federal
agency having jurisdiction in this matter.
      (7)   Hazardous materials. The storage, utilization and manufacture of
solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals and other materials shall be permitted
subject to the standards and regulation of any local, state or federal agency
having jurisdiction in this matter.
      (8)   Smoke. The emission of smoke or dust by any land use in an amount
sufficient to create a general nuisance to adjoining properties shall be
prohibited.
      (9)   Enforcement.
         (a)   Notice of violation. In enforcing performance standards on
existing uses, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may issue a written notice of
violation to an alleged violator. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall, before
issuing such notice, make technical determinations of any probable violation
when such determinations can be made using equipment and trained personnel
normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense. In
other cases, however, technical complexity or extraordinary expense may make it
unreasonable for the city to maintain personnel or equipment for making
determinations of violation prior to issuing a notice of violation. In such
cases, a notice of violation may be issued when the Zoning Enforcement Officer
has other reason to believe there is probable violation. The Zoning Enforcement
Officer shall give notice of violation by any means that ensures a signed
receipt for such notice to the party responsible for the alleged violation. The
notice shall describe the alleged violation and the results of technical
determinations or the other reasons why the Zoning Enforcement Officer believes
there is a violation.
         (b)   Notice contents. The notice shall require either an answer or
correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and within a time limit he or she shall specify in the
notice. The notice shall also state that failure to provide an answer or
correct the alleged violation within this time limit shall constitute admission
of a violation. The notice shall further state that, if technical
determinations have not already been made, upon request of the alleged violator
such determinations will be made. If a violation is found as a result of such
determinations, the cost of the determinations will be assessed against the
properties or parties responsible in addition to any other penalties provided
for. If no violation is found, the city shall pay the cost of the
determinations.
   (H)   Mobile storage structures.
      (1)   A portable on-demand storage structure may be utilized as a
temporary structure within the city when in compliance with the standards of
this section upon the issuance of a temporary structure permit from the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. Any use of such structures within the city not in
compliance with this section shall be unlawful.
      (2)   The term PORTABLE ON-DEMAND STORAGE STRUCTURES (POD) shall be
defined to be: Any container, storage unit, shed-like container or other
portable structure that can or is used for the storage of personal property of
any kind and which is located for such purposes outside an enclosed building
other than an accessory building or shed complying with all building codes and
land use requirements.
      (3)   POD standards.
         (a)   A POD storage structure may be located as a temporary structure
on property within the city for a period not exceeding 30 days in duration from
time of delivery to time of removal. A POD structure shall not be located in
the front yard of any lot within the city. Such temporary structure shall be
located no closer than five feet to any property line.
         (b)   Permits for such temporary uses and structures may be issued by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer after submission of a completed temporary
storage structure permit application and payment of the permit application fee.
An approved permit is valid for the specified 30-day time frame only. Such POD
structure may not be located on a specific property more than four times in any
given calendar year period. Applicants seeking to extend the time frame
consistent with the provisions in this section must complete a new application
and submit a new permit application fee payment for each time period sought.
         (c)   No more than one POD storage structures may be located on a
specific piece of property within the city at one time.
         (d)   Such structure may not exceed eight feet six inches in height,
ten feet in width or 20 feet in length.
         (e)   All such temporary structures shall comply with the appropriate
building code provisions and such other requirements as are imposed by the city
or the Chief Building Official to ensure the safety of the public.
      (4)   It shall be the obligation of the owner of the property on which
the POD is located or the user of such temporary structure to secure it in a
manner that does not endanger the safety of persons or property in the vicinity
of the temporary structure. In the event of high winds or other weather
conditions in which such structure may become a physical danger to persons or
property, the appropriate law enforcement officers may require the immediate
removal of such temporary structure.
      (5)   Any portable on-demand storage structure which is not removed at
the end of the time for which it may lawfully remain in place, or immediately
upon the direction of a law enforcement officer for removal of such temporary
structure for safety reasons, may be removed by the city immediately, without
notice, and the cost of such removal, together with the cost of administration
of its removal, may be assessed against the property on which the temporary
structure was located and may be filed as a lien against such property by the
city. Such lien shall be superior in priority to all other liens or
encumbrances upon the property, including the lien of a mortgage, and shall be
equal in priority to the lien of ad valorem taxes.
   (I)   Regulation of farm animals. The raising of farm animals shall not be
permitted in any zoning district within the city unless the area consists of 20
acres or more, is classified for current agricultural use valuation (CAUV)
regulations through the Hamilton County Auditor, or has been approved as an
agricultural district under R.C. § 929.02.
   (J)   Regulation of chickens. Notwithstanding other provisions in the Code
of Ordinances, after obtaining the required permit, chickens may be kept within
the city in any residential district subject to the following rules and
conditions.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, chickens are not deemed to be "farm
animals" as defined in division (I) of this section so long as said chickens
are kept, raised, or used in any manner related to a personal or household use,
such as for personal consumption, education, or to maintain such animals as
pets. Chickens may not be kept, raised or used for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the sale of chickens or eggs or to convey the same
for profit, in which case such chickens are deemed to be "farm animals" as
defined in this code.
      (2)   Restrictions.
         (a)   Each household in the city may keep up to six chickens on the
premises at any one time.
         (b)   Only female chickens, aka hens, may be kept in the city. Males,
aka roosters, are not allowed at any time.
         (c)   No chickens may be slaughtered on any residential property in
the city.
         (d)   Chicken feed must be kept in a rodent and predator-proof
container.
      (3)   Habitat.
         (a)    Chickens may only be maintained outdoors in a predator-proof
chicken house, coop, or other structure that is thoroughly ventilated, of
sufficient size to permit free movement of the animals, designed to be easily
accessed, cleaned, and maintained by the owner, and at least two square feet in
size for each chicken.
         (b)   All such structures are herein defined as "habitat" or "habitat
structure" and shall be considered as accessory structures as defined elsewhere
in this code. A zoning permit is required for this and all other accessory
structures. All such structures shall comply with the provisions set forth in §
153.17, including but not limited to a ten-foot setback from adjoining side
yard property lines and a five-foot setback from rear property lines in R-1 and
R-2 Districts.
         (c)   In addition to the other conditions and restrictions applicable
to accessory structures, at least 50% of any structure housing chickens must be
appropriately screened from the street and abutting properties by either a
fence, wall, or landscaping as permitted in the city to provide reasonable and
appropriate cover to reduce, lessen, or obscure the visual impact of the
structure. Such screening shall be evenly spaced around the structure as
appropriate.
         (d)   Chickens shall be enclosed within the habitat structure at night
from sunset to sunrise. If chickens are allowed by the owner to be outside of
the structure from sunrise to sunset, the chickens must be contained within an
area that is fenced or surrounded by other barriers ("containment area") so as
to prevent access to the chickens by dogs or other predators, and to prevent
chickens from traveling outside of the containment area. Fencing may not exceed
six feet in height and must be constructed of fencing liner or mesh and shall
not be visible from the street.
         (e)   All areas in and around the chicken habitat structure must be
maintained in a clean, safe, sanitary and orderly manner for the health and
welfare of the chickens as well as all other animals and persons. No part of
the structure or surrounding area shall constitute a nuisance. In addition to
the provisions and remedies set forth in the Property Maintenance Code, no
person shall allow the chickens or the habitat to be a nuisance, including but
not limited to allowing noxious odors or any noise of a loud or persistent and
habitual nature.
      (4)   Permits.
         (a)   No person shall keep a chicken on property within the city
without a permit issued by the city. There is no fee for the permit. The Zoning
Enforcement Officer has the authority to consider all such permit applications
as well as revocations of any such permit. Applications for a permit shall be
made in writing and submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer. A decision on
a permit application shall be made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer within 15
business days of receipt, excluding weekends and holidays. If a permit
application is denied, or if a permit is revoked, the property owner may appeal
the Zoning Enforcement Officer's decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals within
20 days of the date the Zoning Enforcement Officer's written decision is
issued. If a permit is revoked, the property owner may continue to maintain
chickens on the subject property pending an appeal and decision by the Board of
Zoning Appeals unless the revocation is due in whole or part to a nuisance, in
which event such nuisance must be remedied as directed by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer whether or not the revocation is appealed.
         (b)   Any person submitting an application for a permit under this
section shall consent to an inspection by the city of the property where the
chicken(s) will be kept.
         (c)   If the Zoning Enforcement Officer becomes aware of a possible
violation of this section on property subject to a permit under this section,
the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to inspect the property at
any reasonable time after written notice to the occupants of the subject
property to determine whether or not a violation exists. If the Zoning
Enforcement Officer determines that a violation of the Code of Ordinances
exists, the property owner shall be notified to bring the property into
compliance within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. If the property is not brought into compliance within the
time to remedy a violation, the permit shall be automatically revoked.
      (5)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer may designate any employee or agent
of the city to perform any of the duties of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, or
exercise the authority of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, as prescribed by this
section.
      (6)   Whoever violates this section is in violation of this code and is
subject to enforcement and penalties as established in §
153.01(G).

§ 153.19 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these off-street parking and loading
regulations is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by regulating
those facilities in all zoning districts. The intent is to provide for
convenient and sufficient access to activities which require parking or
loading, to limit on-street parking and loading to facilitate traffic flow and
safety, to encourage a more attractive economic, business, and residential
climate, and to enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community.
   (B)   Compliance; general requirements.
      (1)   No building or structure shall be erected, substantially altered,
or its use changed unless permanently maintained off-street parking and loading
spaces have been provided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
The review process to determine adequacy of parking or loading spaces shall be
congruent with the review of site plan applications.
      (2)   The provisions of this section, except where there is a change of
use, shall not apply to any existing building or structure. Where the new use
involves no additions or enlargements, there shall be provided as many spaces
as may be required by this section.
      (3)   Whenever a building or structure constructed after the effective
date of this section is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees,
number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise to create a need for
an increase in the number of existing parking spaces, additional parking spaces
shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a
building or structure existing prior to the effective date of this section is
enlarged to require a site plan application as provided for in §
153.06 or enlarged to the extent of 50% or more in floor area, number of
employees, number of housing units, seating capacity or otherwise, the building
or structure shall then and thereafter comply with the full parking
requirements set forth herein.
   (C)   Parking space dimensions. A parking space shall have minimum
rectangular dimensions as provided Table 3 and Figure K. All dimensions shall
be exclusive of driveways, aisles, and other circulation areas.

shall be provided and maintained on the same lot for every separate occupancy
requiring delivery of goods and having a modified gross floor area of up to
5,000 square feet. One loading space shall be provided for each additional
10,000 square feet or fraction thereof. Off-street loading spaces located
within a C-1 District may be reduced in size or waived if the applicant can
adequately demonstrate the scale and intensity of the goods intended to be
delivered does not warrant a dedicated off-street loading space in lieu of an
on-street location or an off-street loading space located on an adjacent parcel
upon written consent of the adjacent property owner.
   (G)   Lighting. Any parking area which is intended to be used during non-
daylight hours shall be properly illuminated to avoid accidents. Any lights
used to illuminate a parking lot shall be so arranged as to reflect the light
away from the adjoining property. The illumination standards set forth in §
153.06(E)(2) shall govern.
   (H)   Location of parking spaces. The following regulations shall govern the

      (4)   Parking spaces constructed to serve residential structures
converted to commercial use shall be located in the rear yards to the maximum
extent practical.
      (5)   New development and expansion projects located within the C-
1 District may request a waiver from the minimum off-street parking space
requirements required under this section when it is shown that adequate off-
street parking area is not available to meet the required standards and the
existence of other parking arrangements will satisfy the parking space
requirements including, but not limited to utilizing on-street parking or other
off-street parking lots located on an adjacent lot or lots in close proximity
to the subject parcel, as determined by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   (I)   Parking lot landscaping and perimeter buffering.
      (1)   In order to mitigate visual impacts on adjacent uses, particularly

parking areas shall conform to the landscaping and perimeter buffering
requirements contained in division (I) of this section.
         (d)   There shall be a paved hard surfaced driveway leading to the
gravel parking area that is a minimum of 12 feet in length. The length of the
paved driveway is to be measured from the existing near edge of pavement or
from the property line. The exact requirement for the length of the paved
driveway shall be determined by the Planning Commission based on the need to
minimize impact on nearby properties from dust, noise, or gravel infiltration.
         (e)   Gravel parking surfaces shall remain free of grass and weeds.
         (f)   The infiltration of environmental contaminants shall be
minimized. Environmental contaminants include, but are not limited to, motor
oils, volatile organic compounds, for example: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
zylene, and ethylene glycol.
         (g)   Gravel parking areas are auxiliary to the primary use of the
property. The applicant must provide a paved primary lot that serves the
parking needs of customers and employees on a regular basis for the primary use
of the lot. The parking spaces within the gravel lot shall not count towards
the parking requirements outlined in division (M) of this section.
         (h)   A temporary gravel parking lot shall have side borders
consisting of pressure treated landscape timbers, railroad ties, pressure
treated wood, composite "plastic wood", or similar border materials as approved

         (i)   Wood borders shall be pressure treated or be treated to prevent
the decomposition of the wood when the wood is applied to the ground surface.
The minimum size of any wood borders or composite plastic wood borders shall be
3½ inches wide by 3½ inches high and shall be continuous around the border.
Multiple pieces may be stacked to achieve the required size. Where railroad
ties are used, the ties shall be structurally sound and fully intact and shall
be continuous around the border. All wood borders or composite plastic wood
borders must be affixed to the ground by driving a metal stake through the

not listed in division (M) of this section shall be the same as required for a
use of similar nature as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   In calculating parking requirements, fractional numbers shall be
increased to the next whole number. For example, 13.01 shall mean 14.
      (3)   For the purposes of this section on parking, “floor area” shall
mean the outside dimensions of the building, including all projections such as
stairways and porches, multiplied by the number of floors. The resulting number
shall be the square footage of the building used for determining the number of
off-street parking spaces required.
      (4)   Where there is an adequate public transit system or where parking
demand is unusually low, the parking space requirements may be reduced
proportionally by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   (R)   Enforcement. Whoever violates any provision of these off-street
parking and loading facilities, and fails to conform to any provision thereof
or fails to obey any lawful order of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, issued in
pursuance thereof, and for which no other penalty is provided is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor on a first offense; on a second offense within one year after
the first offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree;
on each subsequent offense within one year after the first offense such person
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. Each day's violation or failure
to conform shall constitute a separate offense.

NOTES:
•   Capital letters in parenthesis mean plantings from the referenced plant list in division (K) of
this section. For example (B) means the plant shall be selected from Plant List B.
•   O.C. means on center, unless otherwise noted.
 
   (E)   Bufferyard materials and standards. New development and expansion
projects shall provide buffering yards as provided in division (D) of this
section. Existing vegetation shall be preserved in accordance to acceptable
nursery industry procedures. The following items are suitable for screening use
individually or in combination with each other provided they create a dense
screen, subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission. Nursery
stock identification tags shall not be removed from any planting prior to
inspection and approval of final installation by the city.
      (1)   Walls and fences. When walls or fences are used to fulfill
screening requirements, they shall be detailed on the plan. They are to be of
weather-proof materials. This includes pressure treating or painting of lumber
if it is not redwood or cedar and using aluminum or galvanized hardware. Chain
link fences with or without wooden or synthetic slat material shall not be
permitted when used to satisfy bufferyard requirements.
      (2)   Plants. All plants are to be living and part of the acceptable
plants list identified in this section or identified as acceptable plant
material for hardiness in this USDA Agricultural Zone and as approved by the
Planning Commission. Plant materials used in conformance with the provision of
this section shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspection required under state
regulations. Trees shall be balled and burlapped or in containers. Shrubs,
vines and ground covers can be planted as bare root as well as balled and
burlapped or containers. All trees shall be measured from the top of the root
ball to the top of the tree mass.
         (a)   Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of
at least three inches with a single central leader, for large and medium trees,
conforming to acceptable nursery industry procedures at the time of planting.
If deciduous trees are to be used for screening purposes, additional materials
listed in this section must be used to create a dense bufferyard.
         (b)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of eight
feet in height at the time of planting and shall be unsheared, full and
branched to the ground. Evergreen plantings shall be designed to provide an
effective, dense screen within four years of planting.
         (c)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least 36 inches
in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges shall be designed to
provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at least six feet
within four years after the date of the final approval of each planting. The
height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the level of the
surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the screening.
         (d)   Grass or ground cover. Grass of the Fescue (Gramineak) or
Bluegrass (Poaceae) family shall be planted in species normally grown as
permanent lawns in southwest Ohio. In swales or other areas subject to erosion,
solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch and temporary seeding shall
be used for immediate protection until complete coverage otherwise is achieved.
Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Grass
shall be sown or placed in any area not landscaped or paved. Ground cover shall
be planted in such a manner as to provide 75% complete coverage after two
growing seasons, but in no circumstance shall planting be more than 12 inches
on center to present a finished appearance. Rocks, pebbles, sand and similar
materials are not approved ground cover.
         (e)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds may be used as physical barriers
which block or screen a view. Differences in elevation between areas requiring
screening does not constitute an earth mound. Earth mounds shall be constructed
of earthen materials and shall conform to the following standards:
            1.   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one
vertical (3:1) and the design shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission to
ensure that proper erosion prevention and control practices have been utilized.
            2.   Berms and earth mounds shall be designed with physical
variations in height and alignment throughout their length.
            3.   Landscape plant material installed on berms and earth mounds
shall be arranged in an irregular pattern to accentuate the physical variation
and achieve a natural appearance.
            4.   The landscape plan shall show sufficient detail, including a
plan and profile of the berm or earth mound, soil types and construction
techniques to demonstrate compliance with the above provisions.
            5.   Berms and earth mounds shall be located and designed to
minimize the disturbance to existing trees located on the site or adjacent
thereto.
            6.   No part of any berm or earth mound which is elevated more than
30 inches above natural grade shall be located within ten feet of any right-of-
way or property line.
            7.   Adequate ground cover shall be used and maintained to prevent
erosion of the earth mound.
            8.   Topsoil shall be placed over the all earth mounds at a depth
of four inches to facilitate vegetation growth on the mound.
         (f)   Bedding surface. Any landscaped area shall not contain bare
soil, aggregated stone or decorative rock. Any ground area shall be covered
with hardwood mulch, grass or other vegetative ground cover. All plant material
will be mulched with shredded hardwood mulch, or approved equal. Plant material
massings will be incorporated into mulch beds.
      (3)   Maintenance of bufferyards and landscaping.
         (a)   All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained
according to accepted nursery industry procedures. The owner of the property
shall be responsible for the continued property maintenance of all landscaping
materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free
from refuse and debris at all times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall
be replaced within one year of the certified date of planting, or by the next
planting period, whichever comes first, by plant material similar in size and
type to that which was removed.
         (b)   Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall
be grounds for the Zoning Enforcement Officer to refuse the issuance of a
zoning permit, require replacement of the landscape material or institute legal
proceedings to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   The owner or developer must provide a maintenance plan at the
site plan review before Planning Commission which indicates how the established
bufferyards and landscaping will be maintained.
      (4)   Bufferyard establishment. Once a bufferyard has been approved by
the Planning Commission and established by the owner, it may not be used,
disturbed or altered for any purpose. No temporary or permanent structures
shall be placed or erected within any required bufferyard areas. Approved
bufferyard walls may be placed in the bufferyard areas.
   (F)   Easements and setbacks.
      (1)   Required landscaping may be placed wholly or partially in utility
or other easements providing all requirements can be fulfilled and approval is
granted by the holder of the easements. Trees placed under overhead utility
wires must be from Plant List A provided in division (K) of this section.
      (2)   In no case, however, shall landscaping and bufferyards be
established so as to block the sight distance at street or drive intersections.
Ground cover and trees with at least eight feet of limbless trunk shall be
permitted within the sight distance triangle. In the case of a city street
intersection, the sight triangle shall consist of the area between points 35
feet from the right-of-way line along both intersecting streets.
   (G)   Landscaping for service structures. Service structures shall include
but not be limited to loading docks, propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical
transformers, utility vaults which extend above the ground, ground mounted
utility equipment and electrical and other equipment or elements providing
service to a building or a site located in the C-1 or C-2 Districts. Structures
may be grouped together. However, screening height shall be based upon the
tallest of the structures.
      (1)   Location of screening. A continuous planting of evergreen, solid
wood fence, solid brick wall must enclose any service structure on all sides,
unless such structure must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case
screening material shall be one foot more than the height of the enclosed
structure, but shall not be required to exceed ten feet in height. Whenever a
service structure is located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping
material shall be of an average height sufficient to meet the height
requirements set out in this section. Whenever service structures are screened
by plant material, such material may count towards the fulfillment of required
site landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be required within an area
screened for service structures.
      (2)   Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied
or removed mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the placement of
the container shall be provided within the screening material. The curbing
shall be at least one foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent
possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.
   (H)   Street tree planting requirements.
      (1)   In all zoning districts, applicants shall plant and maintain shade
trees along any portion of the proposed development site that abuts a public or
private street in full compliance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 52,
Tree Maintenance, of the Codified Ordinances of the city. The Urban Forestry
Board shall review each landscape and buffering plan proposing the planting of
trees or other vegetation in the public right-of-way. The Urban Forestry Board
shall provide a written recommendation to the Planning Commission regarding the
compliance of the provisions of Chapter 52 to be incorporated into the site
plan review process. The Planning Commission may deny a site plan application
for non-compliance of the provisions set forth in Chapter 52.
      (2)   Species and location requirements.
         (a)   Trees shall be limited to species approved by the Urban Forestry
Board.
         (b)   One tree shall be provided for every 40 linear feet of frontage,
or fraction thereof, along each public or private.
         (c)   Trees are to be planted within the public rights-of-way within
and abutting the development as directed by the Planning Commission.
         (d)   Trees shall be planted an adequate distance from intersections
so that at full maturity such planting shall ensure the unobstructed visibility
of motorists and pedestrians.
      (3)   Silverton streetscape plan requirements. Any property located
within the designated Silverton streetscape plan area shall install the
landscape and streetscape elements as provided for in the streetscape plan. The
requirements set forth in the Silverton streetscape plan shall prevail over the
street tree planting requirements provided in this section. The applicable
provisions of Chapter 52, Tree Maintenance, of the Codified Ordinances of the
city shall apply to the streetscape plan area.
   (I)   Building foundation landscaping. A building foundation planting area,
a minimum six feet in width, including ornamental and/or coniferous trees,
shall be provided between the building face and any public or private street
and between the building face and any off-street parking areas. Building
foundation landscaped areas shall contain a minimum of one tree and 12 shrubs
for every 100 square feet of required building foundation landscape area. For
example, if the required building foundation planting area is 425 square feet,
then four trees and 48 bushes would be required.
   (J)   Street frontage landscaping. Any project located within a C-2 District
and meeting the applicability requirements of this section shall provide
landscaping along the perimeter of the front yard area when abutting any public
right-of-way and public or private street. A minimum of 10% of the front yard
area shall be landscaped with a combination of trees, shrubs, planting beds or
perennials. Street frontage landscaped areas shall contain a minimum of one
tree and 12 shrubs for every 100 square feet of required building foundation
landscape area. The minimum width of any street frontage landscape area shall
be six feet and shall be located adjacent to the edge of the public right-of-
way or other suitable location as determined by the Planning Commission. For
example, if the required building foundation planting area is 425 square feet,
then four trees and 48 bushes would be required. Required building foundation
planting areas shall not be counted toward the street frontage planting area
requirements.

   (L)   Landscape and bufferyard modifications.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may approve modifications to the
landscaping and bufferyard requirements. The Planning Commission shall base its
decision on all of the following criteria:
         (a)   The specific conditions which are unique to the applicant's
land.
         (b)   The manner in which the strict application of the provision of
this section would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in a
manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zoning
district.
         (c)   The unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this section.
         (d)   Reasons that the modification shall preserve, not harm, the
public safety and welfare, and shall not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
         (e)   A demonstration that the applicant has provided for a buffer
that achieves the spirit of this section.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may also approve the use of existing trees
within the proposed bufferyard area if the tree is not included on the plant
lists in division (K) of this section, if native and hardy to Zones 5-6 of the
United States Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone Map.
(Ord. 2025-10, passed 5-1-25)
§ 153.21 NONCONFORMING USE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. Within the districts established by this chapter or
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of
land which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter
or future amendments. It is the purpose of this section to permit these
nonconforming lots, structures, and uses to continue until they are removed,
but not to encourage their permanent establishment. It is further the purpose
of this section that a nonconforming structure or use shall not be enlarged or
extended beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time it became a
legal nonconforming use, except as specified in division (D) of this section.
   (B)   Single nonconforming lots of record. Any lot of record which does not
meet the requirements for intensity or size, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district wherein the lot is located, and which exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, may be developed in
conformance with all other requirements of this chapter, provided that the lot
is of separate ownership from all adjacent and contiguous parcels.
   (C)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter and
if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements
established for intensity or size, the lands involved shall be considered to be
an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter and no portion of that
parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with
intensity or size requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any
parcel be made which creates a lot with an intensity or size below the
requirements stated in this chapter.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on intensity or size
or lot coverage or height or bulk or setback, or other requirements concerning
the structure, that structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, and shall be subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered in a manner that does not increase its nonconformity or altered to
decrease its nonconformity;
      (2)   Any building or structure maintaining a physical nonconforming
status as to height, building setback, exterior materials, or otherwise, which
is damaged by explosion, fire, flood, wind or other act of God to the extent of
50% or more of its fair market value immediately prior to such damage, shall
not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code except legal nonconforming residential dwellings may be
reconstructed, regardless of the amount of damage, as provided below:
         (a)   Legal nonconforming residential dwelling structures shall be
permitted to be rebuilt as the same category of dwelling type (i.e. a single-
family dwelling may not be rebuilt as a multiple family dwelling).
         (b)   Any rebuilt residential dwelling structure shall not exceed the
original dwelling's total livable and non-livable square footage area nor
exceed the original structure height.
         (c)   Any rebuilt residential dwelling structure shall not encroach
beyond the original building setbacks.
      (3)   In the event that the Zoning Enforcement Officer's estimate of the
extent of damage or fair market value for the purposes of determining the
applicability of division (D)(2), above, is not acceptable to the applicant for
the zoning permit to repair or reconstruct such building or structure, the
applicant may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (4)   When a nonconforming use qualifies for reconstruction through
damage, a building permit shall be secured for that purpose and reconstruction
shall be diligently completed without delay. Failure to reconstruct within 18
months of the damage revokes the right to the nonconforming use and the
premises shall conform thereafter to the established district regulations.
      (5)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses. Where, at the time of adoption of this chapter
lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed by this chapter, the uses may be continued so long as they remain
otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (2)   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by those uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
      (3)   If any such nonconforming uses of land or structures are
discontinued or abandoned for more than a continuous six-month period (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of
such land or structure shall conform to the regulations specified by this
chapter for the district in which such land is located; and
      (4)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be created in connection with a nonconforming use of land.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe and sanitary
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe or unsanitary
by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of that
official.
   (G)   Avoidance of undue hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon
which the actual building construction has been carried on diligently;
provided, that construction is not found to have been or be a purposely planned
evasion of the intents of this chapter. Actual construction is hereby defined
to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work
shall be carried out diligently, but subject to the same clarifications of
planned intent above.
   (H)   Change from one nonconforming use to another. The Planning Commission
shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to permit a change from
one nonconforming use to another. The Commission shall not permit a change
unless the new nonconforming use is equally or more compatible with permitted
uses in the district in which it is located than the existing nonconforming
use. The Commission shall not allow any changed nonconforming use to be
increased or enlarged, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by the original nonconforming use. In permitting the change, the
Commission shall require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with
other provisions of this chapter.

      (2)   Sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance
from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly
established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,
mounding or excavating solely undertaken for the purpose of locating or
increasing the height of sign.

         (c)   For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted
on a building facade or window where there is no background panel, cabinet or
surface distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to serve as the
background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by means of the
smallest square area that encloses all the letters or elements associated with
the sign. See Figure N.

   Figure N: Illustration of sign area calculation for wall signs with
individual letters
         (d)   In cases where there are multiple sign elements of sign copy on
the same surface, any areas of sign copy that are within two feet of one
another shall be calculated as a single sign area that shall be computed by
means of the smallest permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that
encloses all sign copy within two feet of one another, otherwise the sign area
shall be computed for each separate piece of sign copy. See Figure O.

   Figure O: Illustration of sign area calculations for multiple sign areas on
a window sign
         (e)   Decorative edging or other window treatments that are not an
integral part of the sign copy shall not be considered a part of the sign for
the purposes of this chapter. See Figure O.
         (f)   Except for three-dimensional signs, the sign area for a sign
with more than one face (multi-faced signs) shall be computed by adding
together the area of all sign faces when the interior angle is greater than 45
degrees.
         (g)   When two identically sized, flat sign faces are placed back-to-
back or at angles of 45 degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed
from any one point at the same time, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the sign faces. If the two faces are unequal, the sign
area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.
         (h)   In the case of a three-dimensional sign where the sign faces are
not mounted back-to-back, the sign area shall be calculated by the smallest
permitted shape, or combination of permitted shapes, that encompasses the
profile of the sign message. The profile used shall be the largest area of the
sign message visible from any one point.
      (4)   Facade measurements.
         (a)    When calculating the permitted sign area based on the width of
any facade, such calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a 90-
degree angle (i.e., straight on), regardless of facade insets, offsets, or
angles. See Figure P.

   Figure P: Illustration of facade width measurement on varied façade shapes
         (b)   The primary facade shall be the portion of a frontage that
serves as the main access point to a building or building unit. A site or
building will be considered to have secondary facades when any of the following
site/building characteristics are present (See Figure Q.):
            1.   The subject site is a corner lot;
            2.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; or
            3.   The building or unit has walls with public or customer
entrance points that do not face the public street.

   Figure Q: Common examples of the location of primary and secondary facades
         (c)    When a site has primary and secondary facade as defined herein,
the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall determine which wall shall be the primary
building facade and which wall(s) shall be the secondary building facade. Only
one outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary facade.
         (d)   For multi-tenant buildings where each tenant has its own
exterior entrance, the portion of a building that is owned or leased by a
single occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit. The facade width
for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party walls
defining the building unit. For uses, such as office buildings, where multiple
tenants may locate within the same building and all tenants have interior
access to their tenant space, such building shall be considered one building
without separate building units.
         (e)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to make
the determination of what facades are primary facades and secondary facades for
the purposes of this section.
   (F)   General sign requirements. The following regulations shall apply to
all signs in all use districts:
      (1)   All signs hung and erected shall be plainly marked with the name of
the person, firm, or corporation responsible for maintaining the sign;
      (2)   Glass in any sign shall be either double strength, plate, or wired
glass;
      (3)   All signs that have become insecure must be repaired and made safe
or taken down by owner or agent, within 24 hours of notice; and
      (4)   Sign illumination standards.
         (a)   Signs shall be externally illuminated only by steady,
stationary, shielded light sources directed solely at the sign, except for
signs located in the C-2 Highway Commercial District, which may be externally
lit as expressly approved by the Planning Commission during site plan review.
For sign permits that are not part of a site plan review process (e.g., the
permit is strictly for the sign), then the applicant may seek approval of
alternative illumination through the same process as site plan review.
         (b)   Use of glaring, unshielded or undiffused lights or bulbs shall
be prohibited. Lights shall be shielded so as not to project onto adjoining
properties or thoroughfares.

the application. At the discretion of the city, any false or misleading
statement in the application may subject the applicant to denial of the
application without further consideration or opportunity for correction.
      (3)   Applications for any zoning permit or conditional use permit
required by this section shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
with all fees and application content required pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E). Applications not meeting the requirements stated herein or
which are otherwise incomplete may be rejected by the city.
      (4)   General requirements. In addition to providing all of the required
information, the following shall apply as part of the application:
         (a)   Any and all representations made by the applicant to the city on
the record during the application process, whether written or verbal, shall be
deemed a part of the application and may be relied upon in good faith by the
city.
         (b)   All utilities at a wireless telecommunications facilities site

National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code, as well as
accepted and responsible workmanlike industry practices and recommended
practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors. The codes referred to
are codes that include but are not limited to construction, building,
electrical, fire, safety, health, and land use codes. In the event of a
conflict between or among any of the preceding the more stringent shall apply.
         (g)   A holder of a conditional use permit granted under this section
shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses required by
applicable law, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain the same, in full
force and effect, for as long as required by the city or other governmental
entity or agency having jurisdiction over the applicant.
         (h)   An applicant shall submit to the city the number of completed
applications determined to be needed at the pre-application meeting. Written
notification of the application shall be provided to the legislative body of
all adjacent municipalities and to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         (i)   The applicant shall examine the feasibility of designing a
proposed tower to accommodate future demand for at least five additional
commercial applications, for example, future co-locations. The tower shall be
structurally designed to accommodate at least five additional antenna arrays
equal to those of the applicant, and located as close to the applicant's
antenna as possible without causing interference. This requirement may be
waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the
provisions of future shared usage of the tower is not technologically feasible,
is commercially impracticable or creates an unnecessary and unreasonable
burden, based upon:
            1.   The foreseeable number of FCC licenses available for the area;
            2.   The kind of wireless telecommunications facilities site and
structure proposed;
            3.   The number of existing and potential licenses without wireless

potential shared-use applicant;
            2.   Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared
use of the new tower by other telecommunications providers; and
            3.   Allow shared use of the new tower if another
telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges. The
charges may include, but are not limited to a pro rata share of the cost of
site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design,
construction and maintenance financing, return on equity less depreciation, and
all of the costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared
user without causing electromagnetic interference.
         (k)   Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds
for revocation of the conditional use permit for the tower.
         (l)   There shall be a pre-application meeting. The purpose of the
pre-application meeting will be to address issues which will help to expedite
the review and permitting process. A pre-application meeting shall also include
a site visit if there has not been a prior site visit for the requested site.
Costs of the city's consultants to prepare for and attend the pre-application
meeting will be borne by the applicant.
         (m)   The holder of a conditional use permit shall notify the city of
any intended modification of a wireless telecommunication facility and shall
apply to the city to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications
facility.
         (n)   In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
telecommunication tower, the applicant shall, prior to the public hearing on
the application, hold a balloon test. The applicant shall arrange to fly, or
raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a three-foot in diameter brightly
colored balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower. The dates,
(including a second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date) times
and location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant seven
and 14 days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the city. The applicant shall inform the city, in writing, of
the dates and times of the test, at least 14 days in advance. The balloon shall
be flown for at least four consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 4:
00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary date shall be on a weekend, but in
case of poor weather on the initial date, the secondary date may be on a
weekday.
         (o)   The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis,
completed by a qualified individual or organization, to determine if the tower
or existing structure intended to support wireless facilities requires lighting
under Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This requirement
shall be for any new tower or for an existing structure or building where the
application increases the height of the structure or building. If this analysis
determines that the FAA must be contacted, then all filings with the FAA, all
responses from the FAA, and any related correspondence shall be provided in a
timely manner.
   (E)   Exceptions from a conditional use permit.
      (1)   No person shall be permitted to site, place, build, construct,
modify or prepare any site for the placement or use of wireless
telecommunications facilities as of the effective date of this section without
having first obtained a conditional use permit for wireless telecommunications
facilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, no
conditional use permit shall be required for those non-commercial exceptions
noted in the definition of wireless telecommunications facilities.
      (2)   All wireless telecommunications facilities existing on or before
the effective date of this section shall be allowed to continue as they
presently exist, provided however, that any visible modification of an existing
wireless telecommunications facility must comply with this section. This
includes the maintenance of existing facilities or the replacement of existing
antenna that does not substantially change the visible appearance of the
existing facility. The replacement of any existing antenna shall require an
approved zoning permit to confirm compliance with this requirement.
      (3)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to
determine if any modification is substantial enough as to not comply with this
division and require the application to be resubmitted as a conditional use
permit, pursuant to this Zoning Code.
      (4)   The placement of a new antenna on a previously approved tower that
can accommodate an additional antenna, or the replacement of an existing
antenna, shall require approval of a zoning permit.
   (F)   Location.
      (1)   Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate,
site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with
the following priorities, division (a) below being the highest priority and
division (d) below being the lowest priority.
         (a)   On existing towers or other structures without increasing the
height of the tower or structure;
         (b)   On city-owned properties located in any zoning district;
         (c)   On properties in areas zoned for C-2 Highway Commercial
District; and
         (d)   On properties in areas zoned for R-E Recreation-Education
District.
      (2)   If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority
listed above, then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of
a higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must
satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be
granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
      (3)   An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating
the site proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant
must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the city why co-location is
commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting
or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of
commercial impracticability or hardship.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the city finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the city and its inhabitants, and will not have a deleterious effect
on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
      (5)   The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating
the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on
selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why
sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the
application.
      (6)   Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the city may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
         (b)   Conflict with the historic nature or character of a
neighborhood;
         (c)   The use or construction of wireless telecommunications
facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning
or land use designation;
         (d)   The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable
probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the
city, or employees of the service provider or other service providers; or
         (e)   Conflicts with the provisions of this section.
   (G)   Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities and other
structures.
      (1)   Locating on existing towers or other structures without increasing
the height shall be preferred by the city, as opposed to the construction of a
new tower. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying
existing towers and other suitable structures within four miles of the location
of any proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some other
distance is more reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower
or other suitable structure cannot be used.
      (2)   An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other
suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing
owner to permit its use by the applicant.
      (3)   Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array
technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within
the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.

use permit, but shall be required to received a zoning permit approval.
   (H)   Height.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total
height of any tower, facility and/or antenna and the basis therefore. Such
documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the
height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the city, to
the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
      (2)   The maximum permitted height of a new tower shall be 140 feet,
based on six co-located antenna arrays requiring ten feet of vertical space
each, and an ambient tree height of 80 feet.
      (3)   No tower constructed after the effective date of this section,
including allowing for all attachments, shall exceed that height which shall
permit operation without required artificial lighting of any kind in accordance
with municipal, city, state, and/or any federal statute, law, local law, city
ordinance, code, rule or regulation.

no larger than four square feet located near the base of the tower in order to
provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate area of the presence
of an antenna that has transmission capabilities and shall contain the name(s)
of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s), as well as emergency phone
number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter or cabinet of the
applicant and be visible from the access point of the site and must identify
the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. The sign shall not be lighted,
unless lighting is required by applicable law, rule or regulation. No other
signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
   (L)   Lot size, setbacks, and screening requirements.
      (1)   All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless
telecommunications facility structures shall be set back from any
nonresidential property line a minimum of a distance equal to the height of the
proposed tower or wireless telecommunications facility structure plus 10% of
the height of the tower or structure.
      (2)   Towers and any other proposed wireless telecommunications facility
structures shall be located no less than 500 feet from any residential district
and no less than 250 feet from any public right-of-way.

      (2)   An applicant shall deposit with the city funds sufficient to
reimburse the city for all reasonable costs of consultant and expert evaluation
and consultation to the city in connection with the review of any application,
including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The
initial deposit shall be $8,500. The placement of the $8,500 with the city
shall precede the pre-application meeting. The city will maintain a separate
escrow account for all such funds. The city's consultants/experts shall invoice
the city for its services in reviewing the application, including the
construction and modification of the site, once permitted. If at any time
during the process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500, the
applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the city, replenish the
escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000. Such additional
escrow funds shall be deposited with the city before any further action or
consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in
escrow by the city is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the
conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to
the applicant.
      (3)   The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in division (M)
(2) of this section may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the
completeness of the application and other information as may be needed to
complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction or
modification.
   (N)   Public hearing and notification requirements.
      (1)   Prior to the approval of any application for a conditional use
permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, a public hearing before the
Planning Commission shall be held by the city, notice of which shall be

prior to the scheduled date of the public hearing. In order that the city may
notify nearby landowners, the application shall contain the names and addresses
of all landowners whose property is located within 1,500 feet of any property
line of the lot or parcel on which the new wireless telecommunications
facilities are proposed to be located.
      (2)   There shall be no public hearing required for an application to co-
locate on an existing tower or other structure, as long as there is no proposed
increase in the height of the tower or structure, including attachments
thereto.
      (3)   The city shall schedule the public hearing referred to in division
(N)(1) of this section once it finds the application is complete. The city, at
any stage prior to issuing a conditional use permit, may require such
additional information as it deems necessary.
   (O)   Action on an application for a conditional use permit.
      (1)   The city will undertake a review of an application pursuant to this
section in a timely fashion, and shall act within a reasonable period of time
given the relative complexity of the application and the circumstances, with
due regard for the public's interest and need to be involved, and the
applicant's desire for a timely resolution.
      (2)   The city may refer any application or part thereof to any advisory
or other committee for a non-binding recommendation.
      (3)   After the public hearing and after formally considering the
application, the Planning Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or
deny a conditional use permit. Its decision shall be in writing and shall be
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The burden of
proof for the grant of the permit shall always be upon the applicant.
      (4)   If the city approves the conditional use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities, then the applicant shall be notified of such
approval in writing within ten calendar days of the city's action, and the
conditional use permit shall be issued within 30 days after such approval.
Except for necessary building permits, and subsequent certificates of
compliance, once a conditional use permit has been granted hereunder, no
additional permits or approvals from the city, such as site plan or zoning
approvals, shall be required by the city for the wireless telecommunications
facilities covered by the conditional use permit.
      (5)   If the city denies the conditional use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities, then the applicant shall be notified of such
denial in writing within ten calendar days of the city's action.
   (P)   Recertification of a conditional use permit.
      (1)   Between 12 months and six months prior to the five-year anniversary
date after the effective date of the conditional use permit and all subsequent
five-year anniversaries of the effective date of the original conditional use
permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, the holder of a conditional
use permit for such wireless telecommunication facilities shall submit a signed
written request to the city for recertification. In the written request for
recertification, the holder of such conditional use permit shall note the
following:
         (a)   The name of the holder of the conditional use permit for the
wireless telecommunications facilities;
         (b)   If applicable, the number or title of the conditional use
permit;
         (c)   The date of the original granting of the conditional use permit;
         (d)   Whether the wireless telecommunications facilities have been
moved, relocated, rebuilt, or otherwise visibly modified since the issuance of
the conditional use permit and if so, in what manner;
         (e)   If the wireless telecommunications facilities have been moved,
relocated, rebuilt, or otherwise visibly modified, then whether the city
approved such action, and under what terms and conditions, and whether those
terms and conditions were complied with;
         (f)   That the wireless telecommunications facilities are in
compliance with the conditional use permit and in compliance with all
applicable codes, laws, rules and regulations; and
         (g)   Recertification that the tower and attachments both are designed
and constructed and continue to meet all local, city, state and federal
structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads. Such
recertification shall be by a professional engineer licensed in the state, the
cost of which shall be borne by the applicant.
      (2)   If, after such review, the city determines that the permitted
wireless telecommunications facilities are in compliance with the conditional
use permit and all applicable statutes, laws, local laws, ordinances, codes,
rules and regulations, then the city issues a recertification of the
conditional use permit for the wireless telecommunications facilities, which
may include any new provisions or conditions that are mutually agreed upon, or
that are required by applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, codes, rules or
regulations. If, after such review, it is determined that the permitted
wireless telecommunications facilities are not in compliance with the
conditional use permit and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, codes,
rules and regulations, then the city may refuse to issue a recertification of
the conditional use permit for the wireless telecommunications facilities, and
in such event, such wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be used
after the date that the applicant receives written notice of the decision by
the city, until such time as the facility is brought into compliance. Any
decision requiring the cessation of use of the facility or imposing a penalty
shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a
written record, and shall be promptly provided to the owner of the facility.
      (3)   If the applicant has submitted all of the information requested and
required by this section, and if the review is not completed, as noted in
division (P)(2) of this section, prior to the five-year anniversary date of the
conditional use permit, or subsequent five-year anniversaries, then the
applicant for the permitted wireless telecommunications facilities shall
receive an extension of the conditional use permit for up to six months, in
order for the completion of the review.
      (4)   If the holder of a conditional use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities does not submit a request for recertification of
such conditional use permit within the time frame noted in division (P)(1) of
this section, then such conditional use permit and any authorizations granted
thereunder shall cease to exist on the date of the fifth anniversary of the
original granting of the conditional use permit, or subsequent five-year
anniversaries, unless the holder of the conditional use permit adequately
demonstrates that extenuating circumstances prevented a timely recertification
request. If the city agrees that there were legitimately extenuating
circumstances, then the holder of the conditional use permit may submit a late
recertification request or application for a new conditional use permit.
   (Q)   Extent and parameters of a conditional use permit. The extent and
parameters of a conditional use permit for wireless telecommunications
facilities shall be as follows:
      (1)   Such conditional use permit shall be non-exclusive;
      (2)   Such conditional use permit shall not be assigned, transferred or
conveyed without the express prior written notification to the city. In the
event the real property interest in the telecommunications facilities is wholly

for co-locating on an existing tower or other suitable structure, where no
increase in height of the tower or structure is required, the non-refundable
fee shall be $2,000.
      (2)   No application fee is required in order to rectify a conditional
use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, unless there has been a
visible modification of the wireless telecommunications facility since the date
of the issuance of the existing conditional use permit for which the conditions
of the conditional use permit have not previously been modified. In the case of
any modification, the fees provided in division (R)(1) of this section shall
apply.
   (S)   Performance security. The applicant and the owner of record of any
proposed wireless telecommunications facilities property site shall, at its
cost and expense, be jointly required to execute and file with the city a bond,

punitive, or expenses arising therefrom, either at law or in equity, which
might arise out of, or are caused by the placement, construction, erection,
modification, location, products performance, use, operation, maintenance,
repair, installation, replacement, removal, or restoration of said facility,
excepting, however, any portion of such claims, suits, demands, causes of
action or award of damages as may be attributable to the negligent or
intentional acts or omissions of the city, or its servants or agents. With
respect to the penalties, damages or charges referenced herein, reasonable
attorneys' fees, consultants' fees, and expert witness fees are included in
those costs that are recoverable by the city.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the requirements noted in division (W)(1) of this
section, an indemnification provision will not be required in those instances
where the city itself applies for and secures a conditional use permit for
wireless telecommunications facilities.
   (X)   Fines.

upon conviction for a third or subsequent offense, all of which were committed
within a period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more
than $1,000, or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial
officers generally, violations of this section or of such ordinance or
regulation shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each
week's continued violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything in this section, the holder of the
conditional use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities may not use
the payment of fines, liquidated damages or other penalties, to evade or avoid
compliance with this section or any division of this section. An attempt to do

an interim temporary use agreement/permit, such as to enable the sale of the
wireless telecommunications facilities.
      (3)   The holder of the conditional use permit, or its successors or
assigns, shall dismantle and remove such wireless telecommunications
facilities, and all associated structures and facilities, from the site and
restore the site to as close to its original condition as is possible, such
restoration being limited only by physical or commercial impracticability,
within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the city. However, if the
owner of the property upon which the wireless telecommunications facilities are
located wishes to retain any access roadway to the wireless telecommunications
facilities, the owner may do so with the approval of the city.
      (4)   If wireless telecommunications facilities are not removed or
substantial progress has not been made to remove the wireless

day time period, then the city may take possession of and dispose of the
affected wireless telecommunications facilities in the manner provided in this
section.
   (AA)   Relief. Any applicant desiring relief, waiver or exemption from any
aspect or requirement of this section may request such at the pre-application
meeting, provided that the relief or exemption is contained in the original
application for either a conditional use permit, or in the case of an existing
or previously granted conditional use permit, a request for modification of its
tower and/or facilities. Such relief may be temporary or permanent, partial or
complete. However, the burden of proving the need for the requested relief,
waiver or exemption is solely on the applicant to prove. The applicant shall
bear all costs of the city in considering the request and the relief, waiver or
exemption. No such relief or exemption shall be approved unless the applicant
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, if granted, the relief,
waiver or exemption will have no significant affect on the health, safety and
welfare of the city, its residents and other service providers.
   (BB)   Periodic regulatory review by the city. 
      (1)   The city may at any time conduct a review and examination of this
entire section.
      (2)   If after such a periodic review and examination of this section,

(Ord. 2025-10, passed 5-1-25)
§ 153.24 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Short title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
Subdivision Ordinance of Silverton, Ohio and shall be referred to herein as
"these Subdivision Regulations."
   (B)   Purpose and scope.
      (1)   The purpose of these Subdivision Regulations is to provide rules,
regulations and standards to guide the subdivision of land in order to promote
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare within the city.
Standards shall be administered to ensure orderly growth and development, the
conservation, protection and proper use of land, and adequate provisions for
traffic circulation and services. These Subdivision Regulations shall not apply
to any lot or lots forming a part of subdivision created and recorded prior to
the date these Subdivision Regulations are enacted.
      (2)   These Subdivision Regulations shall apply to all unsubdivided land
proposed as a major subdivision or a minor subdivision, and to any land
replatted in the city, but shall not be deemed a basis for, nor shall it in any
way diminish or relax any existing restrictions or provisions set forth in any
subdivision protective covenants, or any such restrictive covenants which may
appear in any deed, contract or plat of record.
   (C)   General compliance regulations.
      (1)   After the adoption of these Subdivision Regulations, no land shall
be subdivided or replatted without complying with the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations. No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision
or constituting a subdivision under R.C. Chapter 711 shall be offered for sale,
nor shall any sale or contract for sale which is intended to be recorded with
the county have any validity, until such subdivision, together with the plans
for the improvements thereto, has been properly reviewed and officially
approved by the Planning Commission and, where required, by Council.
      (2)   No permits required for any work in connection with any subdivision
shall be issued until the plat has been approved as herein prescribed.
      (3)   No improvements, such as water supply, storm water drainage,
sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service or lighting, or major
grading operation, paving or surfacing of any street, shall be made within any
such subdivision by any owner or owners or his or their agent, or by any public
service corporation at the request of such owner or owners or by his or their
agent, until the plats for the subdivision and also the plans for the
improvements have been properly reviewed by the City Engineer and officially
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Where a tract of land is proposed to be subdivided in several
stages over a period of years and the subdivider requests approval in parts, he
or she shall, at the time of submission of the first part, submit a complete
preliminary plan of the entire tract to be eventually developed, with
appropriate sectioning adequate to demonstrate to the Planning Commission that
the total design as proposed for the entire subdivision is acceptable under the
terms of these Subdivision Regulations including conformance with the official
Transportation Master Plan. The Planning Commission may give preliminary
approval to the overall plan and final approval on the parts as submitted from
time to time. The city hereby defines its policy to be that the city will
withhold all public improvements of whatsoever nature, including the
maintenance of streets and the furnishing of water service, from the
subdivisions which have not been approved and from all areas dedicated to the
public which have not been accepted by the Planning Commission and Council in
the manner prescribed herein.
      (5)   The provisions of these Subdivision Regulations shall be held to be
the minimum requirements necessary in the subdivision of land.
   (D)   Minor subdivisions.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, a minor subdivision is a lot
split, lot consolidation, or transfer of land between adjacent property owners
that complies with all of the following requirements:
         (a)   The subdivision shall not result in or create more than five
lots, including the remainder of the original lot (e.g., four new lots and the
remainder of the original lot);
         (b)   The subdivision shall be in compliance with all applicable site
development standards in this code or with any variance approved from such
standards;
         (c)   All lots resulting from the minor subdivision shall have
frontage and access on an existing street and shall not require the
construction, expansion, or improvement of any street;
         (d)   The subdivision shall not require any public improvements or the
dedication of rights-of-way;
         (e)   The property has been surveyed and a survey sheet or record
plan, in the form provided for in this code, and a full legal description of
the changes resulting from the split, are submitted with the application; and
         (f)   No landlocking of parcels shall occur as a result of the minor
subdivision.
      (2)   A minor subdivision also includes the recombination of land,
consolidation of lots, transfer of property from one lot to an adjacent lot,
and the dedication of additional land for the widening of existing streets,
where no new lots are created.
      (3)   Minor subdivisions may be administratively approved by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer or the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have the authority
to forward the application to the Planning Commission for review if there is
any question about the applicability of the standards in this Zoning Code or if
there is a need for the Planning Commission to consider waiving any of these
Subdivision Regulations.
      (4)   Applications for a minor subdivision shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer with all fees and application content required
pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E).
      (5)   All major subdivision improvement standards set forth in these
Subdivision Regulations shall apply unless otherwise waived by the Planning
Commission.
      (6)   When the development of new residential dwellings is proposed in
conjunction with a minor subdivision application, a reciprocal access easement
and common infrastructure maintenance agreement shall be submitted with the
application contents. No zoning permit shall be issued until the applicant
provides the city with evidence of proper recordation of the reciprocal access
easement and common infrastructure maintenance agreement.
      (7)   All subdivisions that are not considered to be minor shall be
reviewed as a major subdivision by the Planning Commission in accordance with
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (E)   Major subdivision review procedure.
      (1)   Pre-application conference (optional).
         (a)   Prior to filing a subdivision, an applicant may request a
meeting with the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a pre-application conference to
provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed development and to
provide general guidance to assist in the preparation of the subdivision plats.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer may invite additional city staff or review
agencies to participate in the discussion.
         (b)   An applicant may also request a pre-application meeting with
Planning to discuss the concept of the proposed development. The applicant may
request such meeting by submitting a written request, along with any supporting
documents, to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for placement on the agenda of the
next regularly scheduled meeting or any special meeting that may be called by
Planning Commission.
         (c)   No action can be taken by the administrative staff or Planning
Commission until the applicant submits an actual subdivision application.
Therefore, all discussions that occur between the applicant and/or applicant’s
representative(s) and staff or Planning Commission that occur prior to the
submission of an actual application are not binding on the city and do not
constitute official assurances or representations by the city or its officials
regarding any aspects of the plan or application discussed.
      (2)   Preliminary plat review.
         (a)   The applicant shall begin the formal review process by filing a
preliminary plat applications for a major subdivision shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer with all fees and application content required

required drawing standards for any plats. The preliminary plat submission shall
be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio and
shall include a general location map.
         (b)   Preliminary plat applications shall also include a traffic
impact study for all applications where the expected trip generation of the
land use is 100 or more cars per hour as identified in the Institute of Traffic
Engineers (ITE) Manual. The traffic impact study shall contain the information
established in §
153.06(E)(4).
         (c)   All proposed subdivisions shall have a storm drainage system
designed to serve the area being developed. It shall be compatible to any
adjacent storm drainage system and shall have in all cases a clear and
unobstructed outlet. The storm drainage system shall be designed in such a
manner to minimize the effects on the downstream properties within reasonable
limits. The preliminary drainage plan shall:
         (d)   The developer, owner or their engineer may apply to the Planning
Commission for an exception to the detention or retention requirements. Each
request shall be accompanied by a study showing the effects of the proposed and
required drainage system on the watershed it is located in.
         (e)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall keep one copy of the
application, together with one copy of the preliminary plat for the city
records.
         (f)   Five copies of the preliminary plat shall be retained by the
Planning Commission for review. The remaining copies shall be submitted to the
Health Department, City Engineer, Fire Department, Police Department or other
agencies.
         (g)   The preliminary plat application contents shall be placed on the
meeting agenda of Planning Commission for consideration. Upon review of the
application for conformance to these Subdivision Regulations, the zoning code
and any other applicable document, the Planning Commission shall transmit a
letter to the applicant either approving or disapproving (with reasons
provided) or, where such changes or corrections are minimal, the Commission may
give a conditional approval, stating the plat is approved, subject to the set
forth requirements being met. Where it appears that for any reason conditions
do not warrant either complete approval or conditional approval, the
preliminary plat shall be returned to the applicant or his agent setting forth
reasons for disapproval. The plat, revised and corrected, may be resubmitted
within one year without payment of an additional application fee.
         (h)   Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for two
years from the date of approval, and such approval may, at the discretion of
the Commission and upon written request of the applicant, be renewed for one
additional year.
         (i)   If the construction drawings and specifications are not
submitted for at least a reasonable section of such plat within the following
two-year approval period or renewal year, the preliminary plat approval shall
be deemed to have expired. If no construction activity consistent with an
approved construction drawing and specification plan is not instituted within
six months following the end of the renewal period, then the preliminary plat
approval shall be deemed to have expired.
         (j)   Also, where a portion of the lands shown on any preliminary plat
have been developed and platted in a phased manner, the approval of the
remainder of the preliminary plat shall be deemed in effect for one year from
the date Council approves such final plat; and unless plans and plats for
additional sections are submitted prior to expiration of the one-year period,
the preliminary plat approval shall be deemed to have lapsed. The timely
submission of such plans or plats for approval shall extend effective approval
for one additional year.
      (3)   Filing construction drawings for approval.
         (a)   Prior to the submission of the final record plat, 12 copies of
the necessary construction drawings shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission.
         (b)   A review fee established by ordinance of Council equaling 1.5%
of the estimated infrastructure improvement costs for the portion of the plat
for which the construction drawings have been designed shall be paid to the
city prior to the construction drawings being placed on the agenda for
consideration of recommendation of the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Construction drawings and specifications.
            1.   Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning
Commission, construction or improvement plans, as prepared by the owner's
engineer, shall be submitted and reviewed by the City Engineer, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and any other proper city officials, and evidence shall be
provided that such plans have been duly approved by the State Environmental
Protection Agency, the County Health Department or any other governing agencies
or departments when approval by such agencies is required by law.
            2.   The construction plans shall be prepared by or under the
immediate direction of a registered professional engineer, registered in the
State of Ohio, and same shall be complete, showing all improvements, including
storm and sanitary sewers, culverts, water and gas mains, with typical cross-
sections of streets, profiles and any necessary special details.
            3.   The plans shall in every way equal or exceed the standards as
adopted by the city for subdivision improvements.
            4.   The plans, when submitted to the City Engineer for review,
shall be accompanied with a map showing division of drainage runoff areas and a
complete set of storm water calculations determining pipe or ditch channel
sizes and detention/retention volumes and routing.
            5.   In the preparation of construction or improvement plans, every
reasonable effort shall be made to avoid placing utility pipe lines, storm and
sanitary sewer pipe lines (but not including service connections which must
necessarily cross the streets) under pavements or curbs.
            6.   After the completion of the construction of the improvements,
as-builts shall be submitted in a digital format compatible with the city
consultant's CAD system, and on one set of mylars.
            7.   It shall be the duty of the owner, his or her agent or
engineer to consult with public service and utility companies as to location of
all underground conduits, pipe lines, cable and telephone conduit, overhead
poles, street lights, wires, etc., and to provide necessary easements for such
facilities on the final plat.
            8.   The approval of plans by the City Engineer, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer and the Planning Commission shall not relieve the owner,
developer or his or her engineer of any liabilities, damages or legal action
which may result from faulty, careless or negligent design or construction
observed within the guarantee period.
      (4)   Final plat review.
         (a)   Upon approval of the construction drawings for the proposed
subdivision or a particular phase of the proposed subdivision, the final record
plat, together with a durable reproducible copy thereof, shall be submitted to
the Zoning Enforcement Officer. The applicant shall submit all fees and
application content required pursuant to §
153.02(D) and (E). The required checklist of information shall also include the
required drawing standards for any plats. The final plat submission shall be
prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio and shall
include a general location map.
         (b)   Both copies of the plat shall be referred to the City Engineer
for review and signed by him or her if approved, or returned to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer with recommendations and comments attached.
         (c)   The plat shall thereupon be presented to the Planning Commission
for approval. If the Commission approves the final plat, it shall be so
indicated on both original and reproducible copy over the signature of the
Secretary of the Commission, whereupon same shall be returned to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer for submission to Council.
         (d)   City approval. After the approval of the final plat by Council,
the developer shall submit cost estimates, bonds, and letters of credit to the
Clerk of Council prior to Council signing the final plat for recording. Once
the information is submitted, the Clerk of Council shall indicate the approval
of Council on both copies of the final plat with a statement of approval,
including the date and ordinance number, bearing the signature of the City
Clerk. The reproducible copy shall be permanently filed in the office of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         (e)   Approval notification. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
notify the subdivider of the action of the Planning Commission and Council by
mail within ten working days after the date of such action. The original
tracing of such approved plat shall be returned to the subdivider or his or her
agent for recording in the County Recorder's office. If such recording is not
made within 90 days, the approval will become void and a resubmission for
approval of the Planning Commission and Council must be made.
         (f)   Performance guarantee. The Mayor and City Clerk shall not
indicate Council's approval on any plat by affixing their names and the
ordinance number until such time as the subdivider has posted the performance
guarantee as set forth in division (QQ) of this section.
   (F)   Conformance. The subdivider shall conform to the following principles
and standards of land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion
thereof which has not been officially recorded in the office of the Recorder of
Hamilton County, Ohio, on or before the date of the enactment of these
Subdivision Regulations.
   (G)   General design considerations.
      (1)   The subdivision plat shall conform to design standards that will
encourage good development patterns and particularly to the principles,
standards, policies and proposals which are specified in the Comprehensive
Plan. Therefore, the Official Transportation Master Plan, drainage rights-of-
way, school sites, public parks and recreation sites and other public buildings
and facilities shown on the officially adopted Comprehensive Plan shall be
considered in the decision to approve or disapprove subdivision plats. Each
subdivision design shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the
Zoning Code, as amended. The City Engineer, at any time during design or
construction or even after the recording of the final plat, shall have the
authority to modify any engineering or construction detail, whenever required
for the protection of the public interest, health, safety or welfare.
      (2)   Every residential lot in any subdivision shall abut and have access
to a dedicated street or right-of-way, except that in a division of land
abutting several lots with the intent of conveying same to such abutting owners
without creating additional residential building sites, these parcels need not
abut a public street.
      (3)   No land shall be subdivided for residential use if considered by
the Planning Commission to be unsuitable for such use because of flooding or
improper drainage, inability to provide proper sanitation or any other feature
harmful to the health and safety of the future residents or the community as a
whole.
      (4)   Every subdivision shall be planned so as to be in conformance with
the regulations for the zone in which it exists.
   (H)   Street regulations.
      (1)   The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of
land within the subdivision. Street jogs at intersections of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided. Street terminations in a cul-de-sac shall not exceed 700 feet
in length unless necessitated by site topography. The measurement shall be
taken from the center of the closest intersection that allows two or more
alternative access routes from the entrance of the subdivision to the center of
the cul-de-sac.
      (2)   Local or marginal streets shall be designed by pattern and layout
so as to discourage through traffic unless otherwise noted in the Comprehensive
Plan.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as
to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
      (4)   Proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to the
boundary of the tract to be subdivided so as to provide for normal circulation
of traffic with adjacent existing or future subdivisions or developed areas.
      (5)   Wherever a dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley exists
within the proposed subdivision, the street or alley shall be platted to the
prescribed width within the proposed subdivision unless such use is vacated.
      (6)   Widths of interstate highways, major and minor arterials, collector
and local street rights-of-way shall conform to the widths specified in the
typical right-of-way sections provided herein. These widths may be increased or
decreased or varied in unusual circumstances by the Planning Commission as
recommended by the City Engineer.
         (a)   Additional right-of-way may be required by the Planning
Commission to accommodate adjacent storm water runoff and drainage.
         (b)   Pavement width shall be measured from back of curb to back of
curb.
      (7)   The minimum right-of-way of local streets, including marginal
access streets and cul-de-sacs, shall be 50 feet. All cul-de-sacs shall
terminate in a circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 110 feet;
minimum pavement width shall be 86 feet on turnaround. No parking shall be
permitted in a cul-de-sac terminus. The developer shall be required to place
"No Parking" signs at the beginning radius, center and ending radius of the
cul-de-sac with signs approved by the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices.
      (8)   Where a street having two or more lots fronting thereon ends at a
subdivision line for future extension, it shall be provided with a temporary
paved turnaround until such extension is completed. The size of the turn-around
shall not be less than 60 feet in diameter.
      (9)   Subdivisions that include, or border on, existing streets that do
not conform to the required widths shall dedicate additional width along either
or both sides of such street. The half width of all public rights-of-way
abutting the proposed subdivision shall be brought to all applicable city
improvement standards.
      (10)   All street intersections shall be a 90-degree angle of
intersection unless special conditions warrant consideration and approval of
other design.
      (11)   At all street intersections, the roadway turning radii shall be
adequate to allow all motor vehicles, trucks, and emergency vehicles adequate
room to turn into a development in a single movement.
      (12)   At street intersections the right-of-way line shall be rounded by
an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be 20 feet. Street curb intersection
shall be rounded by radii of at least 30 feet.
      (13)   Intersection of more than two streets at one point shall not be
permitted.
      (14)   In the interest of public safety, and as a matter of policy, all
points of ingress and egress shall be located as far as possible from the
intersection of two or more major thoroughfares. Access control at major
thoroughfares shall be taken into consideration in the design of the
subdivision plat. The city or ODOT has the right to define access along major
thoroughfares as shown in the Transportation Master Plan set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (15)   Where parkways or special types of streets are involved, the
Planning Commission may apply special standards to be followed in the design of
such parkways or streets.
      (16)   Whenever the subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad
right-of-way, or a highway designated as a limited access highway by the
appropriate highway authorities, provision shall be made for either a marginal
access street or a parallel street at a distance adequate to permit use of
adjoining land.
      (17)   Horizontal visibility on curved streets and vertical visibility on
all streets shall be maintained along the centerlines as follows:
         (a)   Major highways and thoroughfares: 500 feet.
         (b)   Collector streets and parkways: 300 feet.
         (c)   Residential access streets: 100 feet.
         (d)   Where topographic or other conditions warrant, the Planning
Commission may, with the recommendation of the City Engineer, reduce the above
requirements.
      (18)   Horizontal curvature measured along the centerline shall have a
minimum radius as follows:
         (a)   Major highways and thoroughfares: 500 feet.
         (b)   Collector streets and parkways: 300 feet.
         (c)   Residential access streets: 150 feet.
         (d)   Where topographic or other conditions warrant, the Planning
Commission may, with the recommendation of the City Engineer, reduce the above
radii requirements.
      (19)   All changes in grades shall be connected by vertical curves of
sufficient radii to provide smooth transitions and required sight distances.
      (20)   Between reverse curves on major arterial streets there shall be a
tangent of not less than 100 feet, and on collector and local streets such
tangent shall be not less than 40 feet. For hillside areas between reverse
curves on major arterial streets there shall be a tangent of not less than 50
feet, and on collector streets such tangents shall not be less than 20 feet.
      (21)   Maximum grades for streets shall not be greater than those shown
below unless approved by the City Engineer and the Planning Commission.
 
Table 8: Maximum Grade of Streets
Type of Street                Maximum Grade
Major arterials               4%
Minor arterials               7%
Collector streets             7%
Local streets                 10%
Pedestrian ways or crosswalks 12%
 
      (22)   The minimum grade of any street gutter shall not be less than
0.5%.
      (23)   New streets may be called avenue, circle, court, drive, place,
street and way, but they shall not be called roads.
      (24)   Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas but shall be
included in commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and
unloading or access purposes where required; alley rights-of-way shall be at
least 20 feet in width and shall be fully paved.
      (25)   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, but if unavoidable, shall be
provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end, as determined by
the Planning Commission.
      (26)   The street approach to any proposed stub streets or cul-de-sac
street shall not exceed more than 5% grade.
      (27)   The use of cul-de-sac street designs shall be utilized only when
physical features of the site warrant the use this design. Generally, a grid
style street network is encouraged including the use of curvilinear design
elements.
      (28)   Each major subdivision shall provide for multiple access points to
provide more efficient traffic flow, greater connectivity between adjacent
developments and an adequate number of access points for fire, EMS and police
personnel.
      (29)   Medians shall not be located within any cul-de-sac street.
   (I)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall not normally exceed 1,250 feet in length, unless
unusual circumstances justify greater length.
      (2)   Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a limited access
highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way.
      (3)   No other specific rule is made concerning the shape of blocks, but
blocks shall fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their
design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow and public
areas.
      (4)   Within blocks of over 700 feet in length, the Planning Commission
may require, at or near the middle of the block, a public walk connecting
adjacent streets or other public areas, shopping centers, etc.
   (J)   Lots.
      (1)   All lots shall abut on a dedicated street of right-of-way.
      (2)   Side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to
straight streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from
this rule is permissible, but points or very irregular lots shall be avoided.
For hillside areas, side lines of lots shall be located as to provide the most
suitable building site.
      (3)   Minimum lot areas, widths and building setback lines shall be as
provided in the Zoning Code for the district in which the subdivision is
located within the incorporated area of the city, except that where a water
main supply system or a sanitary sewer system is not available, the lot area
necessary to install a private water supply or sewage disposal system on the
lot in accordance with the Hamilton County Board of Health or the Ohio
Department of Health, shall become the minimum lot area.
      (4)   Panhandle lots shall be discouraged and may only be approved if
necessitated by unique topographic features or other special physical
conditions as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission. The panhandle
portion of the lot shall have a minimum width of 20 feet at the road.
         (a)   The stacking of panhandle lots shall be prohibited.
         (b)   The minimum lot size for panhandle lots in any residential
district shall be 150% of the minimum lot size as set forth in the underlying
zoning district regulations.
      (5)   Through lots shall be avoided wherever possible. Where through lots
do exist, the minimum front yard setback shall be required wherever the lot
abuts a right-of-way.
      (6)   Lot design for all residential subdivisions shall utilize the
minimum front yard building setback stated in the underlying zoning district as
the basis for determining lot width.
      (7)   Any major subdivision providing for common area amenities and uses
including but not limited to: Landscaped areas, swimming pool and other
recreational uses, gateway sign areas, stormwater detention or retention
facilities and other similar common use areas shall be wholly located within a
dedicated lot with proper title and interest held by a home owners association
or similar property owners association for the proposed development.
   (K)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements shall be provided for utilities. Such easements shall
have a minimum width of 15 feet, and where located along interior lot lines,
one-half the width shall be taken from each lot. Before determining the
location of the easements, the plan shall be discussed with the local utility
companies to assure the proper placing for the installation of services. Slope
easements shall be provided when required by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Easements of adequate width shall be provided for all streams and
drainage channels.
      (3)   All underground public utility lines, wires, cables, conduits,
vaults, laterals, pipes, mains, valves and other similar distributing equipment
shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in such a manner so
as not to conflict with any other underground service previously installed.
   (L)   Public use areas. Where sites for parks, schools, playgrounds or other
public use areas as shown in the Comprehensive Plan are located within the
subdivision area, the city shall require that such areas be so designated on
the final plat. Within one year after the approval of the final plat, the
authority having jurisdiction shall acquire the designated land or commence
proceedings to acquire it by condemnation, otherwise the owner may make any
other permitted use of the site, as permitted by the zoning district within
which it lies.
   (M)   Topography, natural vegetation and flooding.
      (1)   In the subdivision of any land within the city, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses or other
similar elements which, if preserved, would add attractiveness to the proposed
development.
      (2)   The natural topography shall be retained wherever possible in order
to reduce excessive runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive
regarding of the site.
      (3)   Floor elevations of all buildings shall be carefully studied in
relation to existing topography, proposed street grades, existing trees and
other pertinent site features.
   (N)   Standards and requirements for utility and street improvements.
Utility and street improvements shall be provided by the subdivider in each new
subdivision in accordance with the standards and requirements described in the
following sections. All item numbers that appear below refer to the Ohio
Department of Transportation's Construction and Material Specifications, latest
edition, unless specifically noted as otherwise.
   (O)   Streets. Streets shall be completed in accordance with the plans,
profiles, specifications, and cross-sections prepared for the subdivider by a
registered professional engineer in accordance with sheets one through four of
the standard drawings, and approved by the City Engineer, Zoning Enforcement
Officer and Planning Commission.
   (P)   General requirements.
      (1)   Approval. All construction drawings shall be approved by the
Planning Commission acting upon recommendation for approval by the City
Engineer.
      (2)   Construction drawings. Construction drawings shall be complete in
detail, and shall include plans, profiles, drainage facilities, sanitary sewers
and all utilities and service facilities which are to be installed by the
subdivider.
      (3)   Pavements. Pavements shall be installed with curb and gutter as
shown in sheets one through four of the standard drawings. An equivalent
concrete section may be considered for industrial and collector streets.
      (4)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on all residential
subdivision streets, on both sides of the street. Concrete for sidewalks shall
be concrete, and shall meet the specifications set forth in ODOT Item 608, and
shall be given a reasonably smooth float finish. Where site features prevent
the construction of a sidewalk on both sides of the street, the owner or
developer may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance.
Subdivisions that abut existing public streets shall provide sidewalks along
the full distance of the development beginning and terminating at the project's
property lines, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Storm drainage.
         (a)   Pipe for storm water system, when any portion of the run is
underneath the pavement, shall be per ODOT Item 706.02(IV) minimum and in all
cases shall be placed with good bedding. Pipe for storm sewers and drains, when
entirely outside of the pavement, may be per ODOT Item 707.42.
         (b)   The storm water system shall be designed based on a post-
development 25-year storm. The storm water system includes all closed conduits,
open channels, inlets, manholes and all features designed to collect storm
water from streets and lots, including the necessary piping for the collection
of sump pump drains. The Rational Method will normally be used when calculating
peak rate of runoff in determining conduit size and grade. If the drainage area
is greater than 20 acres, TR55 should be used.
         (c)   In general, all conduits shall be designed on a 25-year flowing
full design using the Manning Formula, with a minimum diameter of 12 inches
with a minimum cover of 18 inches. All changes in size, grade, alignment and
the intersection of two or more sewers must take place in a manhole or catch
basin. If the main route of the storm sewer passes through a catch basin, the
catch basin must have a separate access point for cleaning purposes. The
roughness coefficient (n) shall equal 0.015 for all pipe materials, unless
approved by the City Engineer. The allowable velocity shall not be less than
3.5 feet per second or greater than 18 feet per second based on a 25-year
frequency storm. Rock channel protection and/or other means of energy
dissipation must be used when the outlet velocity is higher than the
permissible erodible velocity for the channel it enters.
         (d)   Inlets or catch basins shall have a capacity not less than the
quantity of flow tributary to the inlet. Inlets at low points or grade pockets
should have extra capacity as a safeguard for flooding from flows in excess of
design flows. Calculations shall be submitted verifying the capacity of each
inlet. Special inlets may be required for streets with steep gradient to
provide the extra capacity such situations require. The inlets shall be so
located that they shall pick up no more than 5.0 cfs, and this only when street
grades do not exceed 6% on either side of the inlet, and when the maximum
concentration of water on each side of the inlet does not exceed 2.5 cfs.
Inlets shall be located upstream of all sidewalks at street intersections,
crosswalks, driveways, and roadways; in all pockets in streets, where a street
grade flattens, and at intervals no greater than 350 feet in gutters. Inlets or
catch basins shall be spaced and located as the conditions may require, but
generally not over 400 feet apart or from a high point. Inlets shall be placed
in such a manner that no storm water shall flow through or into any
intersection. Not more than 500 linear feet of street shall be permitted to
drain into one pair of catch basins when draining from two directions. Gutters
shall be depressed 1½ inches at all catch basins or inlets. Manholes shall be
placed on conduits 36 inches in diameter or less, at not more than 400 feet.
Manhole tops, which otherwise cannot be set outside of the pavement area, shall
be set to meet the pavement grades evenly. All manholes and catch basins which
are on the main route of the storm sewer system shall be provided with channels
to afford a smooth, unobstructed flow. Easements not less than 15 feet in width
shall be provided for all sewers or pipe drains not in a dedicated public
right-of-way, depending on the depth of the sewer. Inlets or catch basins shall
have a capacity not less than the quantity of flow tributary to the inlet.
Inlets at low points or grade pockets should have extra capacity as a safeguard
for flooding from flows in excess of design flows.
         (e)   All subdivisions must include an adequate flood routing system
designed to carry runoff from a 100-year frequency storm. Minimum opening
elevations are to be set by the owner's engineer along all 100-year flood
routes. These elevations are to be a minimum of one foot above the 100-year
water elevation. All storm water is to be routed into the detention or
retention area. When a storm sewer system outfalls into a flood plain of any
major watercourse, the outfall must not be subject to frequent floods or
backwaters. Standard wingwall with erosion control shall be constructed for all
outfalls. Suitable baffles or other energy dissipaters shall be provided if
determined to be necessary by the City Engineer. The invert of the first storm
sewer appurtenance upstream of the outfall structure shall be above the
elevations of the flood plain.
         (f)   Streets may be used as a routing path. Where a street is
designated as the major drainage way, the depth of flow shall not exceed eight
inches at the face of the curb. Where the major drainage way is located outside
a street right-of-way, easements shall be provided and a grading plan is to be
submitted with detailed elevations showing the flood being contained in this
area.
      (6)   Culvert design.
         (a)   Technical Release 55 and the Hydraulic Circular No. 5 are the
recommended procedures for design. A single-span culvert should always be used
in lieu of multiple-span openings. The only time a multiple-opening culvert
shall be considered is when no other single-span structure will function. All
culverts which are a part of the flood route for the 100-year storm shall be
designed for the 50-year storm with head water and a flood route provided to
accept a 100-year storm. Maximum allowable head water shall be 18 inches below
the top of the curb and 12 inches below the edge of pavement where curb does
not exist.
         (b)   The design of the drainage system should not cause back water
onto any adjacent property. If additional back water is caused, an easement
from the affected property owner must be obtained. The back water condition
should be checked on the 50-year frequency storm.
         (c)   A structure having a clear opening of ten feet or more shall be
classified as a bridge and be subject to special conditions under the direction
of the City Engineer.
      (7)   Open drainage ditches.
         (a)   All newly designed open channels shall only accommodate a small
drainage area (i.e. lot swale). All other design drainage features shall be
enclosed with storm sewer, with the exception of large, major channels. All
drainage ditches, where provided as a part of the drainage system, shall have
rights-of-way or easements provided for the city to access and maintain the
ditches. Ditches are to be designed using a full flow 25-year frequency storm
unless the channel is part of the flood routing system, in which case it must
be designed using a 100-year storm frequency. The longitudinal slope of a
channel should be 1% or greater. All side slopes shall be 4:1 or flatter in
residential areas and 3:1 or flatter in commercial areas unless otherwise
approved by the City Engineer and Planning Commission.
         (b)   The maximum permissible design velocity shall not be greater
than the erodible velocity of the design year storm used to design the ditch.
Channel linings will be required as per the ODOT Design Manual. In designing an
open ditch, the flow and grade shall be addressed so as to prevent stagnation.
All seeding, mulching and sodding shall be installed immediately after
construction as per ODOT Item 659 and 660, and kept in ideal growth conditions
until established.
         (c)   Easements or right-of-way widths for open ditches shall be equal
to the bottom width, plus six times the design depth of flow and not less than
15 feet.
      (8)   Retention/detention basins.
         (a)   An adequate amount of land shall be designated for the sole
purpose of detention or retention of storm water runoff. Said area shall be
located on a separate non-buildable lot deeded to and maintained by a
homeowner's association or similar legal entity. Said homeowner's association
or similar legal entity shall execute a perpetual maintenance agreement
suitable for recording with the final record plat at the Recording Office of
Hamilton County. If the maintenance of the area does not meet the requirements
of the city's NPDES permit, the city has the right to maintain said property as
applicable under R.C. § 715.41 and 715.47. The detention or retention area
shall be used as a temporary sedimentation basin during construction. It will
be the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the detention or
retention area meets all original design characteristics prior to the end of
each of the maintenance bond periods for each of the sections of development.
         (b)   In order to minimize storm runoff damage to downstream
properties and overloading of existing drainage courses, the following criteria
shall be followed on all development of parcels one acre or larger in size, and
on all redevelopment of existing buildings or site usage as determined by the
Planning Commission.
            1.   Stage 1 shall allow the discharge of the ten-year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the
ten-year storm flow, post-development less the ten-year pre-developed
discharge.
            2.   Stage 2 shall allow the discharge of the 25-year pre-developed
storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 25-year storm
flow, post development less the 25-year pre-developed discharge.
            3.   Stage 3 shall allow the discharge of the 25-year pre-developed
storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 100-year

new residential structure.
      (7)   The developer shall plant first-class nursery grade street trees,
with not less than a three-inch caliper, every 25 feet on both sides of the
street. At the time of planting, the minimum tree size shall be a three-inch
caliper. Existing trees that are properly located may be used in lieu of
required trees. All tree-planting plans may be modified and/or approved by the
Planning Commission. Street trees located within a center median of any private
or public roadway shall have a water service line extended to the median and
the city's typical water spigot and lock system installed for the purposes of
adequate water supply for tree maintenance.
      (8)   Payments in lieu of tree planting.
         (a)   The Planning Commission may permit the developer to completely
or partially elect out of the tree planting requirement stated above by making
a park development payment in lieu of tree plantings. Said election must be
requested for in writing by the developer and state the reasons such
modification from the 25-foot tree planting requirement should be considered.
         (b)   If the Planning Commission permits the developer to proceed
under this option, the payment in lieu of tree plantings shall be $50 per tree,
based upon the total number of trees required to be planted under this section.
Payment must be made to the city prior to the final record plat being placed on
the City Council agenda for final consideration. Each payment shall only
account for the required trees contained within the subdivided section being
considered for recordation as indicated on the final record plat. All payments
made under this division shall be earmarked for the exclusive use of developing
and maintaining municipal park facilities.
         (c)   The developer shall provide the city with a suitable bond or
letter of credit for the maintenance of all street trees planted within any
public right-of-way areas within the project area. The bond or letter of credit

area of the city included in the adopted Silverton Streetscape Plan, the
developer shall be required to install improvements along the public street
area of the subject site that conform to the city's Streetscape Plan. These
items may include pavers, sidewalks, street trees, street lighting and planters
consistent with the specifications found in the Streetscape Plan.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may permit the developer to make a
streetscape improvement payment-in-lieu request where one or all of the
required streetscape improvements are deemed to be premature relative to
adjacent property development or the status of the overall streetscape
construction phasing. In this event, the city shall transfer these monies to
the Streetscape Improvement Fund and hold the funds for no more than five
years. The monies placed in this fund shall be used exclusively for streetscape
improvements benefitting the applicant's property. If the streetscape
improvements are not made within the five-year period, the city shall promptly
return those remaining streetscape improvement funds to the development.

lay out any private road, street, highway, lane or boulevard, unless the
proposed road, street, highway, lane or boulevard is built in compliance with
the standards of design and construction applicable to public streets. Where
the subdivision is to contain sewers, sewage treatment facilities, water supply
systems, park areas or other physical facilities which will not be maintained
by existing public agencies, the same shall be designed and built according to
the city's, or where applicable, the county's prevailing design standards. The
Planning Commission may waive those public improvement standards for minor
subdivision improvements on a case per case basis.
   (BB)   Soil erosion and sediment control standards.
      (1)   These regulations establish technically feasible and economically
reasonable standards to achieve a level of subdivision design and construction
to minimize damage to property, degradation of natural resources, and to
promote and maintain the health, safety and general well-being of all life and
inhabitants of the city. Further, these regulations promote development while
keeping downstream flooding, erosion and sedimentation at existing levels, and
reduce damage to receiving streams and drainage systems which may be caused by
impairment of their capacity, which may be caused by sedimentation.
      (2)   Construction site erosion and sediment control.
         (a)   No person shall cause or allow earth-disturbing activities, land
clearing, grading, excavating or filling except in compliance with the
performance criteria set out in division (BB)(3) of this section.
         (b)   Erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy the
performance criteria shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of The Rainwater and Land Development handbook (a copy of this may be
obtained from Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District).
         (c)   The performance criteria are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the city to impose additional, more stringent requirements,
nor shall the criteria limit the right of the city to waive individual
requirements.
      (3)   Performance criteria.
         (a)   Sediment control practices shall be functional throughout earth-
disturbing activity. Settling facilities, sediment barriers, and other
practices intended to trap sediment shall be implemented as the first step of
grading and within seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue
to function until the up-slope development area is restabilized.
         (b)   Denuded areas shall have soil stabilization applied within seven
days if they are to remain dormant (undisturbed) for more than 45 days.
Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas
within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and
shall also be applied within seven days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade, but will remain dormant longer than 45 days.
         (c)   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at
rates which exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through
a sediment-settling facility. The facilities storage capacity shall be 133
cubic yards per acre of drainage area.
         (d)   Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be intercepted by
sediment barriers. Sediment barriers, such as sediment fences or diversions
directing runoff to settling facilities, shall protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment transported by sheet flow.
         (e)   All storm sewer inlets which accept storm water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer system without first being treated to remove sediment, unless
the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility.
         (f)   Streams, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized
immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or stopped. To the
extent practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where
in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work
area during construction to minimize erosion.
         (g)   If a live (wet) stream must be crossed by construction vehicles
regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
         (h)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto surfaces
where runoff is not checked by sediment controls or onto public roads.
         (i)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource, unless such dumping or placing is
authorized by the Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District, and
when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for such purposes as but not
limited to construction of bridges, culverts, and erosion control structures.
         (j)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or landslides shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendation to
correct, eliminate, or adequately address such problems.
         (k)   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a
manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given to the length
and steepness of the slope, soil type, up-slope drainage area, groundwater
conditions, and slope stabilization.
         (l)   Outfalls and constructed or modified channels shall be designed
and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a post-
development, 25-year frequency storm without eroding.
         (m)   Permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be
considered established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of
the city, provides adequate cover and is mature enough to control soil erosion
satisfactorily and to survive adverse weather conditions.
         (n)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
removed or permanently stabilized within 30 days after final site stabilization
is achieved, or after the temporary practices are no longer needed, unless
otherwise authorized by the city.
         (o)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control
practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance
requirements. They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure
continued performance of their intended function. The person or entity
responsible for the continued maintenance of permanent erosion controls shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the city.
      (4)   Administration; Soil Erosion Sediment Control (SESC) Plan content.
In compliance with division (BB)(2) and (BB)(3) of this section, a SESC plan
shall identify potential erosion and sediment pollution problems from the
development area and describe measures to be taken to control those problems.
The SESC plan must be submitted to and approved by and a permit shall be
obtained from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency prior to any earth-
disturbing activity on the development area. The SESC plan shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   Narrative. The following narrative shall be included on the site
plans in the form of notes:

            7.   Proposed utilities which may affect erosion and sediment
control practices.
      (5)   Inspection and enforcement actions. The City Engineer shall inspect
any permitted development area to determine compliance with the approved plan
and these regulations. When it is determined that there is a violation or the
development area is not in compliance the following procedure shall be
followed:
         (a)   The inspector representing the city shall notify the site
superintendent of the violation and the work required to be in compliance with
the approved plan and these regulations. Notification will be in writing.
         (b)   If the violation still exists, the issue may be reported to the
City Engineer for consideration. If the City Engineer determines that a
violation exists one or all of the following options may be pursued:
            1.   The SESC permit may be revoked. No earth-disturbing activity
shall proceed without a SESC permit.
            2.   An injunction or other appropriate relief may be sought
through a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (6)   The inability to perform any of the inspection and enforcement
procedures as defined in this section shall not preclude the use of any other
procedure, nor shall the procedure be binding in cases of severe hazard or
threat to public welfare as determined by the city.
   (CC)   Hillside development regulations. These regulations apply to all
hillside areas in the city. A hillside area as referred to herein is defined as
one with an average slope of more than 15%. The subdivider shall submit
sufficient detailed information as to geologic conditions, soil types, and
underground water level in order that a determination can be made by the City
Engineer as to the safety of development of the particular location.
      (1)   Determination of average slope. The average slope for any hillside
development shall be determined by the Planning Commission from the preliminary
subdivision submittal. Determination will be on area-by-area basis with each
lot sized according to the average topographic change falling within each area.
      (2)   Grading plan and controls. The overall development plan shall show
contour lines at two-foot intervals. Elevations are to be based on the sea
level datum (U.S.G.S.), with conversions shown to local datum. The lot layout
and the approximate dimensions shall be shown for each lot and each building
site. Where pads are utilized or proposed for building sites, engineering data
shall show the existing topography and the proposed finished grades, location
and size of each building site, and finished grade of streets prior to
consideration of the final record plat.
      (3)   Cuts and fills. No land shall be graded, cut, or filled so as to
create a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one-foot for each three feet of
horizontal distance between abutting lots, unless a wall of sufficient height
and thickness is provided to retain the graded bank. Major cuts, excavation,
grading, and filling, where the same materially changes the site and its
relationship with the surrounding areas or materially affects such areas, shall
not be permitted if such excavation, grading, and filling will result in a
slope exceeding a vertical rise of one-foot for each three feet of horizontal
distance between abutting lots or between adjoining tracts of land, except
where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and erosion by cribbing and
retaining walls.
      (4)   Compaction of fill. All fill shall be compacted to a density of 90%
or greater in accordance with ASTM D-6-98. Inspection of fill shall be
conducted by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Retaining walls. Retaining walls may be required whenever
topographic conditions warrant. Retaining walls shall be designed in accordance
with currently accepted design practices and approved by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Minimum design requirements. Minimum front yard, rear yard, side
yard, and setback requirements shall be in accordance with specifications as
set forth by the zoning regulations of the applicable political subdivision.

approval of the Planning Commission and the City Engineer; and,
         (c)   Waiver of vertical curve requirements may be given subject to
the approval of the Planning Commission and the City Engineer.
      (8)   Driveways. The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed 10% to
the street.
      (9)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks having a minimum width of five feet
and having a minimum thickness of five inches shall be installed along the
uphill side.
      (10)   Conservation easement required. Those areas within a hillside
development exceeding a 15% slope and not containing a building footprint shall
designate those non-building areas to be a non-disturbance area. A conservation
easement requiring no permanent structures be constructed in this area and no
removal of existing vegetation shall be recorded with the final record plat to
preserve these areas in perpetuity as non-disturbance zones.
   (DD)   Construction clean up requirements. The subdivider and all
contractors working within the project shall maintain any adjacent public
street free and clear of mud, dust and debris originating from the project
site. Clean up activities shall be provided on a daily basis if necessary to
avoid the movement of dirt, mud and other debris onto adjacent public right-of-
way areas. A construction clean-off area shall be provided on the project site
and indicated on the construction drawing submission identifying a designated
area for construction vehicles and other equipment to be cleaned prior to
entering adjacent public right-of-way areas. The failure to properly maintain
the adjacent public right-of-way areas in a clean and orderly fashion may
result in a violation of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (EE)   Notification; inspections. During the course of the construction of
the improvements, the subdivider shall be required to notify the City Engineer

      (1)   Limitations of the number, size and location of driveway
approaches/curb cuts for any premises to which the permit applies;
      (2)   Requiring the use of alternative means of access such as service or
private drives or frontage roads, to run parallel to the public street or way,
rather than direct connection to the public street or way where such alternate
means are accessible to the premises to which the permit applies and/or
requiring that direct connection of driveway approaches/curb cuts to the public
street or way be limited and used only until alternative means of access such
as service or private drives or frontage roads are made accessible to the
permit premises;
      (3)   Limiting the construction of driveway approaches/curb cuts to only
one public street or way where the premises to which the permit applies abuts

      (8)   Requiring the consolidation of access points. Major access points
on opposite sides of roadways shall be located opposite each other. If not so
located, turning movement restrictions may be imposed as determined necessary
by the City Engineer. In addition, in order to maximize the efficient
utilization of access points, access drives shall be designed, located, and
constructed in a manner to provide and make possible the coordination of access
with and between adjacent properties developed (present or future) for similar
or compatible uses. As a condition of approval for construction, use, or reuse
of any access point, the City Engineer may require that unobstructed and
unencumbered access, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, be
provided from any such access point to adjacent properties;

public infrastructure shall be provided. The bond or letter of credit shall be
in the amount of 110% of the estimated costs of the improvements. A detailed
spreadsheet outlining the estimated costs of the approved public infrastructure
improvements shall also be provided and approved by the City Engineer. Upon
written request by the applicant, the city may permit the pro-rated reduction
of the performance guarantee instrument value upon an inspection by the City
Engineer documenting the project has progressed to the proposed pro-rated stage
of the overall project.
      (2)   Maintenance guarantee. Prior to the city accepting the public
improvements, maintenance bonds shall be posted by all contractors for the
infrastructure improvements for which they are responsible in the subdivision
approved under this chapter for the full costs of those infrastructure
improvements to the subdivision developer. Unless otherwise authorized in
advance by the City Council, maintenance bonds for street paving and curb and
gutter installation shall be for a minimum of one year. Prior to the release of
the maintenance bond after the one year maintenance period, the City Engineer
shall perform a final inspection of the improvements to confirm the required
condition of the improvements.
   (RR)   Existing driveway approaches and curb cuts. In any case in which an
application for a building permit includes a change in the primary use of the
premises, or in any case in which there is construction, reconstruction,
enlargement or expansion for larger and essentially commercial construction
which must comply with the formal administrative procedures for a zoning permit
in §
153.02(G), the existing driveway approaches/curb cuts for the premises may be
reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (SS)   Specific land use categories. The City Engineer may establish general
conditions applicable to the construction of all driveway approaches/curb cuts
for premises within specific land use categories.
   (TT)   Expense of interference with public facilities. When a proposed

facilities or other necessary street structures, the owner of the parcel of
land served by the driveway approach/curb cut shall pay the expense of moving
and/or altering such structure as determined to be necessary by the City
Engineer.
   (UU)   Conformance with Transportation Master Plan, Subdivision Regulations
and Zoning Code. Proposed driveway approaches and curb cuts or improvements to
existing driveway approaches and curb cuts shall comply with the official
Transportation Master Plan as provided in the City Comprehensive Plan, the
design and improvement standards under these Subdivision Regulations and with
the purpose and restrictions of the Zoning Code before a permit is issued.
Whenever a driveway approach and/or curb cut or improvements to existing
driveway approaches and/or curb cuts embraces any part of a roadway, such part
of the public way shall be platted by the owner or subdivider in the location
and at the width indicated by the aforementioned documents.
   (VV)   Violation. No person, corporation or firm shall violate any condition
specified by the City Engineer under this section in a driveway approach/curb
cut permit. Each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (WW)   Penalty for Subdivision Regulations. Whoever violates any provisions
of these Subdivision Regulations shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall be fined up to a maximum of $100 for each offense. Each day's violation
is a separate offense.

Editor's note:
   This table lists those Ohio Revised Code sections which have been
substantially duplicated by corresponding Code of Ordinance sections. All
legislative history references to “(R.C. § xx.xx)” which appear at the end of
sections (or divisions of sections) in the village's Code of Ordinances have
been listed here. Example: to determine which section of the Code of Ordinances
is based on R.C. § 4511.19, scan down this table to the citation for “4511.19”
and examine the entry across from it: in this case, the corresponding Code of
Ordinances section is § 73.01, which means that § 73.01 (or a part thereof) is
based directly on R.C. § 4511.19.
