      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last

      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any

investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced

as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54) (1981 Code, § 10.04)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.

§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50) (1981 Code, § 10.07)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
(1981 Code, § 10.08)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of such error.
(1981 Code, § 10.09)
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
(1981 Code, § 10.10)
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
(1981 Code, § 10.11)
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
(1981 Code, § 10.12)
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in

secretary of the Design Review Board. All applications shall be in writing and

may be requested by the Design Review Board. Failure to provide such written
information as may be requested by the Design Review Board shall be a proper
basis and reason for the denial of a certificate of appropriateness.
      (2)   An applicant may file as many re-applications for a certificate of
appropriateness with regard to a particular change as the applicant desires.
      (3)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall contain

or his/her representative or agent, is encouraged to be present at the meeting
at which action on the request is to occur.
      (5)   When reviewing a certificate of appropriateness application, the
Board shall consider if such application is:
         (a)   Appropriate to the preservation of the environmental,
architectural or historic character of the structure and property pursuant to
the design criteria in this section.
         (b)   Consistent with the spirit and purposes of this chapter and the
"Standards for Rehabilitation" adopted by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior,
as found in C.F.R. Title 36, Part 1208.
         (c)   In concert with the Archeological Guidelines as prepared by the
OHPO.
         (d)   In accordance with the following considerations regarding
applications for the demolition of a structure:
            1.   The demolition of the structure will not be detrimental to the
character of the area and city will be an improvement of existing conditions.

designated property without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness.
      (2)   The Design Review Board shall make a determination on an
application for a certificate of appropriateness within 30 days of the filing
of the action unless the applicant approves an extension of time. The Design
Review Board may also table the application for additional information, or for
lack of information or clarification until the next meeting or for a specific
period of time. If the Board fails to render its decision within 60 days the
application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed approved. This
provision shall not apply if the application is tabled due to lack of
information provided by the applicant, or due to the applicant requesting that
the application remain tabled.

incorporated herein by reference, and labeled Exhibit "A."
      (4)   In addition to the above procedures, if an application for a
certificate of appropriateness seeks approval of demolition, the Design Review
Board may delay determination of the application for a period of 60 days upon a
finding that the structure is of such importance that alternatives to
demolition may be feasible and should be actively pursued by both the applicant
and the Design Review Board. In the event that action on an application is
delayed as provided herein, the Design Review Board may take such steps as it
deems necessary to preserve the structure in accordance with the purposes of
this section. Such steps may include but are not limited to, consultation with
civic groups, public agencies, and interested citizens, marketing plans,
recommendations for acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or
agencies, and exploration of the possibility of moving the structure or
structures.
      (5)   Following its review, the Design Committee shall either:
         (a)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness as submitted;
         (b)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness subject to specific
conditions; or
         (c)   Deny the certificate of appropriateness.
      (6)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be conditional upon the

competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portion thereof.
   (P)   Affirmation of Existing Zoning. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as repealing or waiving the application within the district of any

§ 37.02 NONLIABILITY OF MUNICIPALITY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Classifications of functions; nonliability; jurisdiction of the
courts.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the functions of political
subdivisions are classified as governmental functions and proprietary
functions. Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political
subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the
political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection
with a governmental or proprietary function.
      (2)   The defenses and immunities conferred under this chapter and R.C.
Chapter 2744 apply in connection with all governmental and proprietary
functions performed by the political subdivision and its employees, whether
performed on behalf of the political subdivision or on behalf of another
political subdivision.
      (3)   Subject to statutory limitations upon their monetary jurisdiction,
the Courts of Common Pleas, the Municipal Courts, and the County Courts have
jurisdiction to hear and determine civil actions governed by or brought
pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Exceptions. Subject to
§ 37.03 and R.C. §§ 2744.03 and 2744.05, a political subdivision is liable in
damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any
of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as
follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the
employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The
following are full defenses to that liability:
         (a)   A member of a municipal police department or any other police
agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call and
the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct;
         (b)   A member of a municipal fire department or any other
firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a
fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or is believed to
be in progress, or answering any other emergency alarm and the operation of the
vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct;
         (c)   A member of an emergency medical service owned or operated by a
political subdivision was operating a motor vehicle while responding to or
completing a call for emergency medical care or treatment, the member was
holding a valid commercial driver's license issued pursuant to R.C. Chapter
4506 or a driver's license issued pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4507, the operation
of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct, and the
operation complies with the precautions of R.C. § 4511.03.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. §§ 3314.07 and 3746.24,
political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or
property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with
respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent
failure to remove obstructions from public roads, except that it is a full
defense to that liability, when a bridge within a municipality is involved,
that the municipality does not have the responsibility for maintaining or
inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that
is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the
grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of,
buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental
function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but
not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other
detention facility, as defined in R.C. § 2921.01.
      (5)   In addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)
through (4) of this section, a political subdivision is liable for injury,
death, or loss to person or property when civil liability is expressly imposed
upon the political subdivision by a section of the Revised Code, including, but
not limited to, R.C. §§ 2743.02 and 5591.37. Civil liability shall not be
construed to exist under another section of this code or the Revised Code
merely because that section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon a
political subdivision, because that section provides for a criminal penalty,
because of a general authorization in that section that a political subdivision
may sue and be sued, or because that section uses the term “shall” in a
provision pertaining to a political subdivision.
   (C)   An order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a
political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as
provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.
(R.C. § 2744.02) (1981 Code, § 37.02)
§ 37.03 DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES.
   (A)   In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an
employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses
or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:
      (1)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the employee
involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial,
prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function.
      (2)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the conduct
of the employee involved, other than negligent conduct, that gave rise to the
claim of liability was required by law or authorized by law, or if the conduct
of the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary
or essential to the exercise of powers of the political subdivision or
employee.
      (3)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy
making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and
responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.
      (4)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the political subdivision or employee involved that gave rise
to the claim of liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of
the injury or death, was serving any portion of his or her sentence by
performing community service work for or in the political subdivision whether
pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or resulted in injury or death to a
child who was found to be a delinquent child and who, at the time of the injury
or death, was performing community service or community work for or in a
political subdivision in accordance with the order of a juvenile court entered
pursuant to R.C. §§ 2152.19 or 2152.20, and if, at the time of that person's or
child's injury or death, the person or child was covered for purposes of R.C.
Chapter 4123 in connection with the community service or community work for or
in the political subdivision.
      (5)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,
death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or
discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment,
supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, unless the
judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or
in a wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in division (A)
(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that division or R.C.
§§ 3314.07 and 3746.24, the employee is immune from liability unless one of the
following applies:
         (a)   His or her acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope
of his or her employment or official responsibilities;
         (b)   His or her acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad
faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a
section of the Revised Code. Civil liability shall not be construed to exist
under another section of the Revised Code merely because that section imposes a
responsibility or mandatory duty upon an employee, because that section
provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general authorization in that
section that an employee may sue and be sued, or because the section uses the
term "shall" in a provision pertaining to an employee.
      (7)   The political subdivision, and an employee who is the Chief Legal
Officer of a political subdivision, an assistant of any such person, or a judge
of a court of this state, is entitled to any defense or immunity available at
common law or established by the Revised Code.
   (B)   Any immunity or defense conferred upon, or referred to in connection
with, an employee by division (A)(6) or (7) of this section does not affect or
limit any liability of a political subdivision for an act or omission of the
employee as provided in
§ 37.02 above.
(R.C. § 2744.03) (1981 Code, § 37.03)
§ 37.04 LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.

to actions brought against political subdivisions by all persons, governmental

   (B)   (1)   If a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for
injuries or loss allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or
any other source, the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount
of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political
subdivision recovered by the claimant. No insurer or other person is entitled
to bring an action under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other
contract against a political subdivision with respect to those benefits. The
amount of the benefits shall be deducted from an award against a political
subdivision under division (B)(1) of this section regardless of whether the
claimant may be under an obligation to pay back the benefits upon recovery, in
whole or in part, for the claim. A claimant whose benefits have been deducted
from an award under division (B)(1) of this section is not considered fully
compensated and shall not be required to reimburse a subrogated claim for
benefits deducted from an award pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section.
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section shall be construed to do
either of the following:
         (a)   Limit the rights of a beneficiary under a life insurance policy
or the rights of sureties under fidelity or surety bonds;
         (b)   Prohibit the Department of Job and Family Services from

5111.
   (C)   (1)   There shall not be any limitation on compensatory damages that
represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages. However,
except in wrongful death actions brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2125, damages
that arise from the same cause of action, transaction or occurrence, or series
of transactions or occurrences and that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages shall not exceed $250,000 in favor of any one
person. The limitation on damages that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages provided in this section does not apply to
court costs that are awarded to a plaintiff, or to interest on a judgment
rendered in favor of a plaintiff, in an action against a political subdivision.
      (2)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS

whose property was injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the

personal or property injury or property loss.
         (b)   THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS AWARDED THE DAMAGES does
not include any fees paid or owed to an attorney for any services rendered in
relation to a personal or property injury or property loss, and does not

subdivision or any of its employees in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function. Those judgments shall be paid from funds of the political
subdivisions that have been appropriated for that purpose, but, if sufficient
funds are not currently appropriated for the payment of judgments, the fiscal
officer of a political subdivision shall certify the amount of any unpaid
judgments to the taxing authority of the political subdivision for inclusion in
the next succeeding budget and annual appropriation measure and payment in the
next succeeding fiscal year as provided by R.C. § 5705.08, unless any judgment
of that nature is to be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to R.C.
§ 133.14 or pursuant to annual installments authorized by divisions (B) or (C)
of this section.
   (B)   (1)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO

property injury or property loss.
         (b)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS
AWARDED THE DAMAGES does not include any of the following:
            1.   Wages, salaries, or other compensation lost by the person
injured as a result of the injury that are future expected earnings of that
person;
            2.   Expenditures to be incurred in the future, as determined by

injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation services, or for
other care, treatment, services, products, or accommodations that will be

      (2)   (a)   Except as specifically provided to the contrary in this
section, a court that renders a judgment against a political subdivision as
described in division (A) of this section and that is not in favor of the state
may authorize the political subdivision, upon the motion of the political
subdivision, to pay the judgment or a specified portion of the judgment in
annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, subject to the
payment of interest at the rate specified in R.C. § 1343.03(A). A court shall
not authorize the payment in installments under this division of any portion of
a judgment or entire judgment that represents the actual loss of the person who
is awarded the damages.
         (b)   Additionally, a court shall not authorize the payment in
installments under this division of any portion of a judgment or entire
judgment that does not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded
the damages unless the court, after balancing the interests of the political
subdivision and of the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered,
determines that installment payments would be appropriate under the
circumstances and would not be unjust to the person in whose favor the judgment
was rendered. If a court makes that determination, it shall fix the amount of
the installment payments in a manner that achieves for the person in whose

§ 37.08 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   A political subdivision may use public funds to secure insurance
with respect to its and its employees' potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The insurance may be at
the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the terms and conditions,
that are determined by the political subdivision in its discretion. The
insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in specifications for
competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not required, for the period
of time that is mutually agreed upon by the political subdivision and insurance
company. The period of time does not have to be, but can be, limited to the
fiscal cycle under which the political subdivision is funded and operated.
      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision procures a
policy of liability insurance pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section or
otherwise, the political subdivision may establish and maintain a self-
insurance program relative to its and its employees' potential liability in
damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
political subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a
special fund that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of
the political subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The political
subdivision may allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance program, or
both, among the funds or accounts in the subdivision's treasury on the basis of
relative exposure and loss experience. The political subdivision may require
any deductibles under an insurance or self-insurance program, or both, to be
paid from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury from which a loss was
directly attributable. If it so chooses, the political subdivision may contract
with any person, other political subdivision, or regional council of
governments for purposes of the administration of such program.
         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established self-insurance
programs relative to their and their employees' potential liability as
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section may mutually agree that their
self-insurance programs will be jointly administered in a specific manner.
   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or
its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically waive any
immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if a provision
to that effect is specifically included in the policy of insurance or in a
written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or if any, the
legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing the purchase of
the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the self-insurance
program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of the insurance or
self-insurance program coverage.
   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure insurance and
to establish and maintain self-insurance programs in this section are in
addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to establish and
maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to the Revised Code
or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of any other
authorization.
(R.C. § 2744.08) (1981 Code, § 37.07)
   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) of this
section or a joint self-insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081, has
allocated costs to, or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or
accounts in the subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal officer,
pursuant to ordinance or resolution of the Legislative Authority, shall
transfer amounts equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or accounts
of the subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:
      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee responsible for
the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles;
      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit payment within 45
days after the date of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do not apply
to transfers made pursuant to division (D) of this section.

of each year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other
period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within 105
days from the end of such fiscal year or period. The Administrator is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer or employers from
the salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensations of an employee, and
paid by him or her or them to the Administrator shall be accepted unless
otherwise specified as the return required of an employee whose sole income
subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions, or other
compensation.
   (B)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Administrator setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions, and other

month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of a federal income tax return. The Administrator may
require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due. No penalty shall be
assessed in those case in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended, provided all other filing and payment
requirements of this chapter have been met. Interest will be assessed from the
original due date of the return thru the date the return is filed.
Informational returns, schedules, and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the

violation of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of

by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of
§ 39.07 of this chapter, or where an income tax has been paid to another

balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   Should the return or the records of the Tax Administrator indicate
an overpayment of the tax to which the City of Van Wert is entitled under the
provisions of this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any
existing penalty or interest and then tax liability (beginning with the oldest
delinquencies), and the balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer
communicated to the Tax Administrator, shall be refunded or transferred against
any subsequent liability. This application of payments may be adjusted by the
Tax Administrator as necessary. No additional taxes or refunds of less than $1
shall be collected or refunded.
      (3)   Amended returns.
         (a)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §§
39.11 and
39.15. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable upon request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
         (b)   Within 3 months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to this municipality, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the
income tax of this municipality based upon such final determination of federal
tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.

provide by regulation the manner in which such approval is to be granted,
denied or withdrawn. Such approval for quarterly filing may be denied or
withdrawn by the Administrator when it is deemed to be warranted. The returns
shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator
and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the
Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact
been withheld.
   (B)   Such employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to this municipality and any such tax
collected by such employer from his or her employees, shall, until the same is
paid to this municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer.
   (C)   On or before February 28, of each year beginning with the year 2004,

§ 39.07 DECLARATION.
   (A)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to
§ 39.06 hereof, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or
activity subject to the tax imposed by
§ 39.03 hereof, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or
the estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any; provided, however, if a person's income is
wholly from wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to this
municipality in accordance with
§ 39.06 hereof, such person need not file a declaration.
   (B)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each
year during the life of this chapter or within 105 days of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before 105 days after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (C)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Administrator.

be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent payment date as provided
for herein.
   (D)   (1)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid this municipality
shall be accompanied by a payment of at least 1/4 of the estimated annual tax

      (2)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year basis, on or before one
month following the end of the tax year, if it appears that the original
declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer's income by 10% or
more. At such time a payment which, together with prior payments is sufficient
to pay the taxpayers entire estimated liability, shall be made. If upon the
filing of the return required by
§ 39.05, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay 90% of his or her tax
liability, as shown on the return on or before January 31 or one month
following the end of his or her tax year, whichever is applicable, the
difference between 90% of the taxpayers tax liability and the amount of
estimated tax he or she actually paid on or before January 31 or one month
following the end of his or her tax year, whichever is applicable, shall be
subject to the interest and penalty provisions of
§ 39.10. However, this requirement does not apply to a taxpayer who filed a
current year estimate based on 100% or more of his or her entire previous years
income subject to the tax.
   (E)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month following that for which
such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be

therewith in accordance with the provisions of

§ 39A.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
   (A)   Authority to levy tax.
      (1)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 39A are authorized by Article XVIII, § 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The
tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter 39A are
deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of R.C. Chapter 718. This chapter is deemed to
incorporate the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person
residing in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and
shall be measured by municipal taxable income. The municipality shall tax
income at a uniform rate. The tax is levied on municipal taxable income, as
defined herein at the rate of 1.72%.
   (B)   Purposes of tax; rate. To provide funds for the purposes of general
municipal operations, maintenance, new equipment, extension and enlargement of
municipal services and facilities and capital improvements of this municipality
there shall be, and is hereby, levied a tax on salaries, wages, commissions,
and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (C)   Allocation of funds. That all funds raised by the 1.72% tax rate will
be used as follows: 1.00% will be placed in the General Fund; .50% will be used
for the Street Department; .22% will be used for the Police and Fire Department
and real property.
   (D)   Statement of procedural history; state mandated changes to municipal
income tax.
      (1)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-40,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 39 in accordance with
the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the municipality to continue the
income tax and withholding tax administration and collection efforts on behalf
of the municipality.

years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 2015-40 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter 39

§ 39A.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in R.C. Title LVII, unless a
different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this chapter that is
not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context in both
the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in R.C. Title
LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the
United States relating to federal income tax shall control over the use of the
term in R.C. Title LVII. For purposes of this section, the singular shall
include the plural, and the masculine shall include the feminine and the
gender-neutral. As used in this chapter:
   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. For a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under the definition of net profit, division (4) of this section, means a C
corporation's federal taxable income before net operating losses and special
deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (1) of this definition, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue
Code;
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (4)(b) of this definition,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the

definition, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than 5
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.

this definition.
            2.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by

         (d)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (8) of this definition.
         (e)   Nothing in division (8)(c)1. of this definition precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was

extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in one
or more taxable years by operation of division (8)(c)1. of this definition is
carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(8)(c)1. of this definition shall apply to the amount carried forward.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
39A.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.

indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
39A.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.

entity that has made the election described in the definition of taxpayer,
division (2) of this section, is not a publicly traded partnership that has
made the election described in the definition of net profit, division (4) of

federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under § 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury
regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement
plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.

federal self-employment tax.

§ 39A.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages.
      (1)   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located
or doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
39A.05(B) of this chapter or division (A)(4) or (A)(6) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         (b)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(A)(1)(a) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars. Payment under division
(A)(2)(a) of this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the
Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
39A.09(A) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (B)   Collection at source; occasional entrant.

days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
         (g)   PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are 2 or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(b)1. of this section among those 2
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (5), and (6) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless 1 of
the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at 1 or more presumed worksite
locations in the municipality. For the purposes of this division, PRESUMED

               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in §
39A.05(A) of this chapter.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee if requested.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
39A.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §
39A.05(A) of this chapter.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and VLT.
      (1)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If

and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
         (c)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.

successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and

         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by §
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video
lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         (a)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         (b)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         (d)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the

number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the

39A.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

for the municipality is calculated as follows:
      (2)   Income reduced by exempt income to the extent otherwise included in
income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward equals municipal taxable income.
         (a)   Income for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the net
profit of the taxpayer.
            1.   Net profit for a person other than an individual is defined in
§
39A.03.
            2.   Adjusted federal taxable income is defined in §
39A.03 of this chapter.
         (b)   Exempt income is defined in §

Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   1.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            2.   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by 8;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
39A.05(B) of this chapter;
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.

            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of 1 or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of 1 or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
            4.   A modification of 1 or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(a) of this section, "wages, salaries,

the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (B)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   (a)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal

or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
39A.08(A) of this chapter.
      (7)   (a)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable
income, the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted
to an employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the
employee's income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted
from taxation under the definitions of exempt income, division (12) and
qualifying wages, division (1)(d) in §
39A.03 of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

         (b)   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a 5-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the

in effect under division (C)(2)(a) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a 5-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (C)(2)(a) or (b) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (c), and
(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and by substituting
"an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C
corporation's" appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

39A.03 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do 1 of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
39A.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
39A.06(B) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
39A.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
39A.06(B) of this chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by Ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the municipality. If a
credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the income tax revenue the municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid

month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes

(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
39A.09(A) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be

payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.

of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §

§ 39A.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   A 50% credit against the income tax imposed by this chapter of the
amount so paid by him or her or in his or her behalf to such other municipality
for the tax year commencing on January 1, 2017 and every tax year thereafter.
      (1)   The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on
such income earned in such other municipality or municipalities where such tax
is paid.
      (2)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in
such manner as provided in §
39A.09(F).
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation
plan described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
QUALIFYING LOSS means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for 1 or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
1 or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to 1 or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   QUALIFYING TAX RATE means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in 1 or more
taxable years.
         (c)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than 1 municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income
tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for person working in joint economic development district or
zone. A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
39A.08(A) of this chapter.
   (D)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the 3-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
39A.09(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
39A.09(F), the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the 3-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
39A.09(F) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
39A.08(A) of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

§ 39A.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
   (A)   Return and payment of tax.
      (1)   (a)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
39A.05(A)(3) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
municipality.
         (c)   All resident individual taxpayers shall file an annual municipal
income tax return with the municipality, regardless of income or liability.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   (a)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
         (b)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with
each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
         (c)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         (d)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business
gateway or a portal provided by municipality. The department of taxation shall
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
39A.09(B) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in §
39A.09(B) of this chapter, the provision in §
39A.09(B) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (d) of
this section.
      (9)   (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required
to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or
on or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that
period or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which
the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than 1 date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
39A.05(A) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   (a)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in §
39A.05(B) of this chapter.
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   a.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               b.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit
that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(b) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(2)(c) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b) and (c) or
(B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio business gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic 6-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than 6-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a 6-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a 6-month extension of the date for filing the
taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(b) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
39A.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E)(1)(b) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (E)
(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
39A.09(F) of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10;
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within 3
years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any documentation that
substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be included with the
return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including schedules, other
municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to
verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return will
cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of undocumented credits or
losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
39A.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within 7 days of such last day.
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within 7 days
of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
39A.10(A)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in §
39A.10 of this chapter.

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,

computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
39A.05(A) of this chapter .
   (B)   Authority of Tax Administrator; compromise of claim and payment over
time.
      (1)   As used in this section,  CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable
to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim;
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment- over- time agreement with respect to
a claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or
agreement or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by
misrepresentation of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the
compromise or agreement and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties
or interest that would have accrued in the absence of the compromise or
agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (C)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of 6 years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (D)   Authority of Tax Administrator; requiring identifying information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
39A.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
39A.99 of this chapter.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (D)(1) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
39A.10 of this chapter.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
39A.99 of this chapter for a violation of §
39A.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax

certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or 1 year after
the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.

39A.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.

§ 39A.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §

      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily

to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear

the hearing. The hearing may be informal, but all testimony shall be under
oath.
   (B)   All hearings shall be scheduled within ten days and will be held
within 30 days from the date the request for hearing is filed. Any hearing date

if such modification is necessary in the interest of justice.
   (C)   The Hearing Examiner shall enter into the record of the proceedings
the notice of the civil offense and civil fine, the filing of or the failure to
file an answer, the substance of the answer, a finding of liability, the civil
fine due, payments, delinquency and collection charges, and other relevant
information.
   (D)   The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision and make findings of fact
from the record and conclusions of law in support of the decision within ten
days from the close of the hearing. The findings and conclusions shall
demonstrate that the decision is consistent with applicable laws, ordinances,
regulations and the interest of justice. Any unpaid civil fine is due and must
be paid within ten days after the date of the Hearing Examiner's decision.
   (E)   If the person has taken an administrative appeal authorized by the Van

offense until the appeal has been finally resolved.

Ordinances and served with a notice of civil offense and civil fine specified
as subject to reduction for correction of the violation may offer proof of the
correction to the Hearing Examiner. The offer or proof of correction may be
submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may be

department which issued the notice.

civil fine, the amount paid in excess of the revised civil fine shall be
returned to the person. If the civil fine is reduced and the person has not

request the Van Wert Municipal Court to review the record of the proceedings
before the Hearing Examiner. The director of a city department that issued a
notice of civil offense and civil fine dismissed by the Hearing Examiner may

writing, specify with particularity the claimed errors in the decision by the
Hearing Examiner, filed with the Civil Division of the Van Wert Municipal
Court, pay any applicable filing fee as set forth by the Van Wert Municipal
Court and sent to the office of administrative hearings by certified U.S. mail
within ten days of the date of the mailing of the decision by the Hearing
Examiner. The city officer or employee who issued the notice of violation which
gave rise to the request for review or a supervisor to the issuing officer may
file a written response to the request for review. The response must be filed
within 15 days of the receipt of the request for review by the officer of
administrative hearings. The Van Wert Municipal Court may set aside the
decision of the Hearing Examiner on finding from review of the proceedings
before the Hearing Examiner that the findings of fact and conclusions of law
are not supported by the record. The Van Wert Municipal Court may reduce a
civil fine on a showing that the civil fine would cause an undue hardship and
that the underlying infraction has been cured or is unlikely to reoccur. The
Van Wert Municipal Court may investigate a claim that an infraction has been
cured, make findings with respect to the claim of cure, and include those
findings within the record. The decision of the Van Wert Municipal Court may be
appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals in the same manner and form as
any civil action filed with the municipal court.

   (A)   If any wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the
wastewater treatment works which contain pollutants in excess of normal
concentrations as defined in
§ 51.085 and/or possess characteristics which, in the judgment of the city, may
have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment works or receiving
waters, including violation of applicable NPDES permit, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city shall:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the wastewater treatment works;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;

   (A)   If oils and grease are biodegradable and in a physical state that does
not cause clogging or undue maintenance problems in the wastewater facilities,
the discharge of these substances can be accepted in a wastewater treatment
system. Animal and vegetable oils and grease (polar substances) are readily
degradable in aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems provided that
the physical states of the oils and grease do not prevent the necessary contact
with the biological suspensions responsible for treatment. However, oils and
grease of mineral origin (primarily nonpolar substances) are essentially non-
biodegradable either in aerobic or anaerobic processes and should be removed
from industrial wastes to the maximum degree practical before discharge. The
discharge of these oils and grease of mineral origin shall be limited to the
regulation of the city. Grease separators are required for all meat packing
plants and on building sewers serving hotels, restaurants, and institutions in
which large numbers of meals are served.
   (B)   The use of garbage grinders precludes the use of gravity grease
separators. Flammable waste and grit intercepting facilities must be provided
on all building sewers from garages, filling stations, cleaning establishments
and other concerns using volatile oils or solvents. Special pretreatment
methods are required for the removal of soluble cutting oils. All grease and
oil removal facilities must be approved by the city.

§ 51.096 EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES.
   In addition to the base user charges applicable pursuant to
§ 51.095, users discharging pollutants to the wastewater treatment works, whose
average concentration, as defined in
§ 51.085, in one or more classifications exceeds in any month that
concentration defined as normal in
§ 51.085 in the corresponding classification shall be subject to surcharges
calculated as follows:
   (A)   Surcharges for each billing period during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values for the calendar year: the estimated total
operation and maintenance expenses (Cto); the estimated total pounds of BOD
received at the plant (Bt); and the estimated total pounds of suspended solids
received at the plant (St). Data not available shall be estimated in the most
practical manner possible.
   (B)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of BOD in excess of normal equals:
   Cto x .40
    Bt
Until revised pursuant to the provisions of
§ 51.099, the surcharge for BOD in excess of normal concentration shall be $.37
per pound.
   (C)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of suspended solids in excess of
normal equal:
   Cto x 0.30
    St
Until revised pursuant to the provisions of
§ 51.099, the surcharge for suspended solids in excess of normal concentration
shall be $.27 per pound.
   (D)   Pounds of BOD per billing period subject to surcharge equals: average
concentration of BOD, calculated pursuant to
§ 51.085 in milligrams per liter minus 216 milligrams per liter times the
volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works
per billing period, in 1,000 gallons times .0083. If the average concentration
of BOD is 216 milligrams per liter, or less, no surcharge for BOD shall apply.
   (E)   Pounds of suspended solids per billing period subject to surcharge
equals: average concentration of suspended solids calculated pursuant to
§ 51.085, in milligrams per liter minus 260 milligrams per liter times the
volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works
per billing period, in 1,000 gallons times .0083. If the average concentration
of suspended solids is 260 milligrams per liter, or less, no surcharge for
suspended solids shall apply.
   (F)   Surcharge on user charges equals the pounds of BOD calculated pursuant
to division (D) of this section times surcharges per pound calculated pursuant
to division (B) of this section plus pounds of suspended solids calculated
pursuant to division (E) of this section times surcharge per pound calculated
pursuant to division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Formulas as contained in divisions (B) and (C) of this section shall
be subject to adjustment as necessary based upon annual audit of sewer revenue
fund expenses.

wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system
or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Van Wert
wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and
which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (B)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the Van
Wert wastewater system through the enforcement of administrative regulations
and permits. This chapter does not provide for the recovery of operations,
maintenance or replacement costs of the POTW or the costs associated with the
construction of collection and treatment systems used by industrial
dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which are the subject of
separate enactments. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the text, all
existing sewer ordinances shall remain in effect.

data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (C)(2) and (3), the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless the Director authorizes time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling. Where the Director authorizes time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling, the samples must be representative of the discharge.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-
hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide,
total phenols and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected

any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
suspension of the city's wastewater treatment service shall, within a
reasonable period of time as determined by the city, cease all discharges. In
the event of failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order within the specified time, the city shall commence judicial
proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with
such order. The city shall reinstate wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater discharger permit and terminate any judicial proceedings upon proof
by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or
conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth
above.

any fence or other barrier designed and erected to prevent traffic from
entering or leaving a limited access highway without the permission of the
Director of Transportation, except in a case of emergency where life or
property is in danger. No person, firm or corporation shall cause a vehicle of

   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 3767.99(D))
§ 70.10 THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where 2 or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at 1 or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than 1 mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where 2 or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at 1
or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

owner of the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons therefor and the
place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded vehicle shall
appear at the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity
and ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a release form, the
claimant, owner, or operator shall either pay the amount due for any fines for
violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or, as the court may
require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to answer to such
violations. The pound operator shall release such vehicle on the receipt of the
release form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
   (C)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place
of storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.

provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways;

   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

having obtained a driver’s license.

provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.
(R.C. § 4510.111)
   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. § 4510.037 and
who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any public roads
and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point suspension, a

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)
§ 71.19 OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
registrar of motor vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the registrar, upon a driver's or
commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than 3 years have passed since the offender's last
violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house

      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.

the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent

to (D)(5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         (a)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(1)(b), (D)(1)(c), (D)(1)(d),
and (D)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of

         (b)   If, within 2 years of the violation, the offender has been

      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(D)(1)(a) of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (D)(1)(a) of this section and the assessment of points under division
(D)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (A) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (D)(1)(b) and (D)(1)(c) of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (A) of this section
within 2 years of the offense for which the course was completed. This division

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the 2 offenses are allied offenses of similar import
under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an

for a violation of division (A)(1)(a) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within 3 hours of the time of the
alleged violation. The 3-hour time limit specified in this division regarding
the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time limit
specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during which a
person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this division when a person submits to
a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C. § 4511.191
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or urine sample
is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse,
an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this division, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under this division
(D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director
pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN- INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.011, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.

violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A)(1)(b),
(A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h), (A)(1)(i), or

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within 7 days after the defendant to whom the report pertains or
the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the 7-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))

chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within 2 hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does not
submit to the test or tests within that 2-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.

under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the

arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
“(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under

not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the

arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited

controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a

least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within 5 days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;

to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time

unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within 3 miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its

state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any 1 axle does not exceed 2 inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed 1/4 inch
per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing 1 such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing 1 such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.

§ 90.01 DOGS AND OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING AT LARGE; IMPOUNDING.
   (A)   Any dog, cat, or other animal running at large contrary to the
provisions of this chapter shall be captured in a humane manner, using only
those devices provided by or approved by the Van Wert County Humane Agent, and
provided necessary sustenance until it is turned over to the Humane Agent. The
owner, keeper, or harborer of an animal seized in this manner shall be notified
if it has a legible name plate, or tag with adequate information to make
notification possible. In cases where no information is provided, and the owner
is unknown, the seized animal will be impounded at the Humane Shelter for 3
working days, not including the first day it was impounded, awaiting
redemption.
   (B)   No dog, cat, or other animal shall be redeemed by or released to
anyone except the owner, keeper, or harborer, or his or her duly authorized
agent thereof. Release shall only be upon payment of the regular impoundment
fee as provided for dogs in R.C. § 955.17 regardless of the animal species.
   (C)   If the impounded dog, cat, or other animal is not redeemed and
released to the owner, keeper, harborer, or agent thereof within the required 3
days' redemption period, said animal shall either be euthanized, or sold for
accumulated costs incurred. The carcasses of any animals euthanized shall be
disposed of by appropriate personnel as soon as possible in a sanitary and
appropriate manner, meeting with the demands of public health.

§ 90.02 CONTROL OF ANIMALS IN PUBLIC; FAILURE TO CONFINE OR CONTROL AN ANIMAL.
   No animal being the property of another shall be permitted to run at large,
whether licensed, or unlicensed, muzzled, or not muzzled. All animals shall be
under the reasonable control of a responsible person at all times, and shall be
physically restrained while off the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer
either caged in a dependable, suitable enclosure, or dependable suitable lead
not to exceed 6 feet in length.

R.C. § 955.01.
   (B)   Every dog over the age of 3 months, whether kennel licensed or
individually licensed, and, if individually licensed, when off the owner's

officer. Furthermore, no person who owns any animals shall fail to provide such
animal adequate opportunity for exercise; regular veterinary care and when
needed, veterinary care for injury or illness, to treat injury or illness,
unless the animal is instead humanely euthanized; or other care as is needed

provision, ABANDON means for the owner or keeper or person in charge to leave
any animal without demonstrated or apparent intent to recover or to resume

locate the vehicle owner fail, any law enforcement officer or animal control
officer may take action necessary to rescue a confined animal to remove the
threat of further serious harm. The owner, keeper, or person in charge will be
liable for all reasonable and necessary impound, board and medical fees. No
officer or agent taking action shall be liable for damages necessary to rescue
the confined animal.
         (d)   Animals must have access to a structure sheltered from wind,
rain, snow and sun in temperatures at or below 10ºF or at or above 85ºF, or

visual range of a competent person who is outside with the animal.
      (2)   Any animal impounded for being kept in violation of this section
may be humanely euthanized upon advice of a licensed veterinarian and by the
Supervisor if he or she deems it necessary to relieve suffering. The cost for
care and treatment of any animal impounded under this section shall be charged
to the owner, keeper, or person in charge, whether or not they seek to regain
custody of such animal.
      (3)   The owner, keeper, or person in charge of any animal who has been
charged under this section who fails to appear in court on the scheduled date
to enter a plea or fails to appear on any additional court dates, after
entering a plea, without permission from the judge or authorized court
employee, will have 14 days from that date to settle the matter with the court.
Failure to comply will result in the animal being held at the shelter to become
the property of the city, allowing it to be adopted or, if necessary, humanely
euthanized.
      (4)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of
a misdemeanor of the first degree, unless the violation is of division (G)(1)
(d), which would result in an unclassified misdemeanor which would carry a fine
of no less than $50 or no more than $1,000. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
Furthermore, all code enforcement as well as law enforcement officers may
enforce each provision of this code section.

the violation complained of the particulars thereof, and such other information

§ 100.09 CURRENT PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
365 days of the alleged violation with the Fair Housing Coordinator or the
Commission a complaint in writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state the
name and address of the person alleged to have committed the violation

   (B)   Upon the filing of a complaint the Fair Housing Director for the

ascertain facts and issues. If the Fair Housing Director shall determine that
there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he or she
shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conference shall be made public by the
Commission or any member of the Commission or its staff unless the parties
agree thereto in writing.
   (C)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Commission by its chairman.
   (D)   The Commission is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the
Ohio Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation
under this chapter.
   (E)   If the Fair Housing Director determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds under which to base a violation of this chapter, he/she
shall so inform the Commission and the Commission may in its discretion dismiss
such complaint or order such further investigation as may be necessary;
provided that the Commission shall not dismiss such complaint without first
affording the complainant an opportunity to appear before the Commission.

a violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Commission
immediately and the Commission shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this resolution has been committed. The
Commission shall serve upon the respondent a statement of the charges and a
summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and
place of hearing. The respondent or his or her authorized counsel may file such
statements with the Commission prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary
in support of its position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except
that the respondent may request in writing a private hearing: the determination
of such request shall be discretionary with the Commission. The hearing shall
be held not less than 15 days after service of the statement of charges and
summons. The summons so issued must be signed by 2 members of the Commission
and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons
and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply
with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested
parties may, at their option, appear before the Commission in person or by duly
authorized representative and may live the assistance of an attorney. The
parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Fair Housing Director shall keep a full record of
the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person,
and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Commission shall
furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the
Commission deems appropriate.
   (G)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Commission shall determine
upon the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this resolution, the Commission shall, after consultation with the
County Prosecuting Attorney in executive session, state its findings to and
cause requiring the person complained against to cease and desist from such
unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the
purposes of this chapter, with notice that if the Commission determines that
the person complained against has not after 15 calendar days following service
of the Commission's order complied with the order, the Commission will
recertify the matter to the County Prosecuting Attorney for enforcement.
   (H)   Upon recertification to the County Prosecuting Attorney for
enforcement, he or she shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action
brought in the name of the Fair Housing Commission of Van Wert County before a
court of competent jurisdiction. In any such proceeding, where the court
determines that there has been violation of this chapter, the court shall award
compensatory damages and, where appropriate, punitive damages, along with
attorney fees. The court may also order such other relief as it deems necessary
or appropriate.
   (I)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Commission shall determine
upon the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Commission shall state and publish
its findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

of any supplemental written agreement entered into by and between the city and
the grantee;
      (2)   The grantee becomes insolvent, enters into receivership or

the then current highest market value or the original cost thereof, less
reasonable accrued depreciation, whichever is the higher. Within 3 months after
the purchase values are agreed upon or fixed, the city shall pay the amount
thereof in cash to the franchisee, whereupon the city shall be entitled to have
transferred and conveyed to it, and shall be given possession of, the property.
Any franchise conferred by this chapter shall thereupon cease;
      (3)   In the event the city leases the property and equipment of the
franchise, the terms of the lease shall be for the unexpired term of this

determined above, plus an annual allowance for depreciation of equipment of all
kinds based on the original cost of the equipment at the rates allowed or
allowable under the rules and regulations of the United States Internal Revenue
Service. The lease agreement under which the equipment and property of the

obtained a franchise from the city, within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the city after expiration of the franchise term, the grantee
shall, if permitted by the city, abandon the property in place or enter upon
the public ways and public places of the city for the purpose of removing
therefrom all of its plants, structures, and equipment and shall promptly
remove all of its facilities and equipment from the premises of all subscribers
at a time convenient to both the grantee and the subscriber.

refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall
leave public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to
the company's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting,
altering, or disturbing in any way the electric distribution or telephone
cables, wire, or attachments on any poles. The Director of Public Safety and
Service or his or her appointee shall inspect and approve the condition of
public ways and public places and cables, wire attachments, and poles after
removal. In the event of dispute of the Director's opinion, the grantee or any
other person may request a hearing before Council at a regular Council meeting.

§ 111.13 SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (A)   The grantee shall maintain and operate its broadband
telecommunications network in accordance with the rules and regulations that
are incorporated herein or may be promulgated by the Federal Communications
Commission or the city.
   (B)   The grantee shall provide a network having a minimum initial capacity
of 20 channels with 2-way, data grade, capability. Whenever a reverse or
feedback circuit is routed through a subscriber's premises, it shall be
connected to permit subscriber notification and deactivation. Because total bi-
directional capacity is of a great deal of interest to the city, applicants for
a franchise hereunder may propose greater channel capacities and more
sophisticated 2-way capabilities than the minimums set forth herein in their
application for a franchise, which application shall be incorporated herein by
reference.
   (C)   The grantee shall provide at least 1 dedicated, noncommercial public
access channel and associated production equipment to be made available to the
public at all times on a nondiscriminatory basis. Because the total number of
public access channels is of a great deal of interest to the city, applicants
for a franchise hereunder may propose a greater number of channels than the
minimum set forth herein in their application for a franchise, which
application shall be incorporated herein by reference.
   (D)   The grantee shall, in addition to division (C), provide 2 additional
channels and associated production equipment, 1 for educational use and 1 for
use by the city. For the first 5 years from the date these channels are made
available, there shall be no charge made to their users by the grantee, and
thereafter only in accordance with the schedule of charges filed and maintained
with the Clerk of Council. Because both educational and municipal channel
availability is of a great deal of interest to the city, applicants for a
franchise hereunder may indicate a greater number of dedicated channels for
this purpose than the minimum set forth herein in their application for a
franchise hereunder, which application shall be incorporated herein by
reference.
   (E)   The grantee shall not be responsible for the production costs of
programs prepared for transmission, other than for brief live studio
presentations not exceeding 5 minutes, over the channels set forth in divisions
(C) and (D) other than as he or she may indicate his or her willingness to do
so in his or her application for a franchise hereunder, which application shall
be incorporated herein by reference.
   (F)   The grantee shall carry to the extent permitted by the Federal
Communications Commission, and shall exercise his or her best efforts to obtain
permission from that agency to carry, at least the following television
signals:
      (1)
Channel Number Station Call Letters Location Served
Channel Number Station Call Letters Location           Served

70             WGSU-TV              Bowling Green      ETV
 
      (2)   Time and weather 24-hour per day channel;
      (3)   Other noncommercial educational channels that are operated by an
agency of the State and television stations that broadcast predominately in a
non-English language.
   (G)   In addition to the television signals set forth in division (F) the
grantee shall carry a minimum of five FM radio stations, including WERT-FM.
   (H)   Whereas local programming is of interest to the city, voluntary
efforts to provide a local origination programming channel and the amount of
time therefor will be considered in awarding the franchise. In addition, the
system shall be equipped with an all channel, emergency alert system.
   (I)   The grantee, whenever it is necessary to interrupt service over the
broadband telecommunications network for the purpose of network maintenance,
alteration, or repair, shall do so at a time that will cause the least amount
of inconvenience to his or her subscribers and, unless the interruption is
unforeseen and immediately necessary, he or she shall give reasonable notice
thereof to the affected subscribers.
   (J)   The grantee shall maintain an office and studio within the city limits
which shall be open during all usual business hours, have a listed telephone
number, and be operated so that complaints and requests for repairs or
adjustments may be received at any time.
   (K)   The grantee shall provide same day service response 7 days a week for
all complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments received prior to 2:00
p.m. each day. In no event shall the response time for calls received
subsequent to 2:00 p.m. exceed 24-hours.
   (L)   Upon failing to correct a service deficiency within 24 hours, the
grantee shall rebate 1/30 of the monthly charge for basic service and
additional service to each subscriber for each 24 hours or fraction thereof
after the first 24 hours following report of loss of service to the grantee,
except to the extent that restoration of service is prevented by strike,
injunction, or other cause beyond the control of the grantee. The grantee shall
maintain a log, which shall be filed annually with the city, as set forth in §
111.20, of the reports and of the time of restoration of service.
   (M)   Because the obtaining of Ohio state news is of great interest to the
citizens of Van Wert, within 12 months after the broadband telecommunications
network is substantially completed, as defined in §
111.01, the grantee must file a waiver request to the FCC for the importing of
1 or more network broadcast television stations from Columbus, Ohio.
(1981 Code, § 111.13) (Ord. 5055-73, passed 5-14-1973)

an authorized representative of the city, that the network does comply with
these criteria.
      (2)   The grantee shall file with the Clerk of Council a statement of the
network channel capacity, listing the cable television channels which that
network delivers to its CATV subscribers and the television station or stations
whose signals are delivered on each channel of the network under normal

Clerk and all subscribers shall be notified in writing 30 days prior to the
date of the deletion or addition.
      (3)   The grantee shall conduct, as set forth by the FCC in their Third
Report and Order, complete performance tests of that network at least once each
calendar year, at intervals not to exceed 14 months, and shall file with the
Clerk a certificate detailing the test standards and the results of the tests.
Performance tests will be directed at determining the extent to which the
network complies with the technical standards set forth in this section and at
the discretion of the city shall be conducted in the presence of a technical
representative appointed by the city. The tests shall be made on each cable
television channel in the network and shall include measurements made of at
least 2 trunk extremities and 3 taps selected at random, at least 1 of which is
representative of a terminal most distant from the network input in terms of
cable distance. A statement of the qualifications of the person performing the
test and a description of instruments and procedures used shall be attached to
the test results filed with the Clerk of Council.
      (4)   After reviewing the certificates of compliance required in §
111.14 (A) (3), the city may require that certain additional measurements be
made or that clarifying explanations be supplied as necessary to correct
defective certificates.
   (C)   Technical standards. The following requirements apply to the broadband
telecommunications network performance for Class I, Class II, and Discrete 6MHz
Video Cable Television Channels as measured at any equivalent subscriber
terminal with a matched termination and to each of the cable television
channels in which signals picked off-the-air are delivered to these terminals.
Measurements shall not include the receiver converter if it is required at the
customer's receiver for any of the channels of required carriage.
      (1)   The frequency boundaries of cable television channels delivered to
subscriber terminals shall conform to those set forth in FCC Rules, Section
73.603 (a). All local channels shall be carried on the network synchronously,
that is, on channel to the extent it is technically feasible.
      (2)   The frequency of the visual carriers shall be maintained 1.25MHz+
25KHz above the lower boundary of the cable television channel, up to the
receiving terminals, exclusive of any receiver attachments, such as channel
converters, except for the local VHF channels which shall be carried
synchronously to the extent it is technically feasible.
      (3)   The frequency of the aural carrier shall be 4.5MHz+ 1KHz above the
frequency of the visual carrier, except where monochrome signal origination
occurs within the system, under which conditions the tolerance shall be +5KHz.
All color local origination channels shall have auralvisual separation +1KHz
from 4.5 MHz.
      (4)   The visual signal level at the picture carrier frequency on each
channel shall not be less than 1,000 UV (microvolts) across a 75 ohms
terminating impedance and shall be maintained within the following limits over
the entire ambient temperature range of -40 F to +120 F and with variations in

      (11)   All echos originating within the network shall meet the
nonvisibility criteria developed by P. Mertz of the Bell Telephone Company;
they shall not be greater than -36 db for echos dispersed more than 2
microseconds. For shorter term dispersed echos, the network, including head-end
terminal, shall follow the "Mertz Curve," merging to a "K" pulse deformation
not exceeding 4% of the total system. This latter measurement shall not include
the "K" response of the test modulator and demodulator, if used, i.e. shall be
"network" "K" response. 2 T pulse or equivalent measurement techniques shall be

Articles 800 and 810 of the National Electric Code, current edition.
      (16)   Notwithstanding the fact that the network may be in compliance
with all the standards set forth herein, the city may require a higher level of
performance in any area to resolve signal quality or interference problems.
   (D)   Alternate approach. If the grantee desires to distribute signals by
using multiple cable techniques or specialized receiving devices which, because
of the basic design, cannot comply with one or more of the technical standards
set forth in division (C) (11), he or she may be permitted to operate with that
equipment provided that an adequate showing is made which establishes that the
subscribers are provided an equivalent quality of service. The city expects
full technical proof of equivalent performance before it can judge whether an
alternate approach would be acceptable.
(1981 Code, § 111.14) (Ord. 5055-73, passed 5-14-1973)
§ 111.15 MEASUREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   Measurements made to demonstrate conformity with the performance
requirements set forth in these technical standards shall be made under
conditions which reflect network performance during normal operations,
including the effect of any present or future microwave relay operated in the
Community Antenna Relay Service (C.A.R.S.) intervening between pickup antenna
and the broadband telecommunications network and including the effects of any
microwave local distribution service which may be a part of the network.
      (2)   Special signals inserted in a cable television channel for
measurement purposes should be operated at levels approximating those used for
normal operation. Pilot tones, auxiliary signals, and non-television signals
normally carried on the network should be operated at normal levels. The
following test procedures are included as a guide. There are several recognized
and technically acceptable methods for performing many of the measurements; the
technique and equipment used in each case if different than those set forth
herein shall be fully described in the annual certification to the city.
   (B)   When it may be necessary to remove the television signal normally
carried on a cable television channel in order to facilitate a performance
measurement, it will be permissible to disconnect the antenna which serves the
channel under measurement and to substitute therefor a matching resistance
termination. Other inputs should be connected to maintain the equivalent to or
special test signals on other channels to ascertain network performance.
   (C)   As may be necessary to ensure satisfactory service to a subscriber,
the city may require additional tests to demonstrate network performance or may
specify the use of different test procedures.
   (D)   Network frequency response measurements may be made with a calibrated
signal generator, variable attenuator, and a frequency selective voltmeter. All
TV signals except for ALC, AGC, and ASC pilot carriers may be disconnected
during this test. With all automatic gain control amplifiers in the section
under test set to their normal operating mode, the signal generator shall be
connected to the input to the telecommunications network and set for a low
signal at the desired frequency and level normally present at that frequency
and location. With the meter and variable attenuator connected in series to the
subscriber terminal under tests, the signal level shall be measured and
recorded. Measurements shall then be made in a similar manner for all
frequencies at the levels normally carried on the network.
   (E)   Network noise may be measured using a frequency-selective voltmeter, a
field strength meter which has been suitably calibrated to indicate rms noise
or average power level and which has a known bandwidth. With the network
operating at normal levels and with a properly matched resistive termination
substituted for the antenna, noise power indications at the subscriber terminal
are taken in successive increments of frequency equal to the bandwidth of the
frequency-selective voltmeter, summing the power indications to obtain the
total noise power present over a 4MHz band centered with the cable television
channel or equivalent noise summation technique. If an amplifier is inserted
between the frequency-selective voltmeter and the subscriber terminal in order
to facilitate this measurement, it should be a bandwidth of at least 4MHz and
appropriate corrections must be made to account for its gain.
   (F)   The amplitude of discrete frequency interfering signals within a cable
television channel may be determined with either a spectrum analyzer, a
frequency-selective voltmeter, or other suitable instruments, which instruments
have been calibrated for adequate accuracy.
   (G)   The terminal isolation between any 2 terminals in the network may be
measured by applying a signal of known amplitude to 1 and measuring the
amplitude of that signal at the other terminal. The frequency of the signal
should be close to the mid-frequency of the channel being tested. This test is
to be performed with 150 drop lead, equivalent network if desired, connected to
each output spigot of the customer tap port.
   (H)   Radiation measurements may be made utilizing a frequency-selective
voltmeter calibrated for adequate accuracy and a tunable half-wave dipole
antenna, horizontal polarized. The distance and height above ground of the
measurements shall be in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the FCC,
Volume II, Part 15, Subpart D, for cable television systems.
   (I)   The network cross-modulation measurement may be performed using a
calibrated signal generator having controllable modulation, a detector, and an
oscilloscope. After connecting the signal generator to the lowest standard VHF
frequency input terminal of the head end signal combiner, its output shall be
set for an unmodulated signal identical in frequency and level to that of the
signal normally present at that point. The signals of all other channels
normally carried on the network shall be fed into the combiner at their normal
levels. After connecting the field strength meter to the subscriber terminus,
it shall be tuned to the video carrier frequency of the channel under tests and
with the oscilloscope the modulation level may be read directly from the scope.
   (J)   The network hum modulation may be measured at each video carrier
frequency on the network using a calibrated signal generator, a detector, and
an oscilloscope. The signal generator shall be connected, the level and
frequency adjusted, and all other channels set at their normal levels. With the
detector and oscilloscopes connected to the subscriber terminus, the average
level of the detected signal and the peak-to-peak AC hum will be indicated on
the oscilloscope; the percent of the average level of the detected signal to
one-half the indicated peak-to-peak AC hum.
   (K)   All actual recorded values observed as a result of the various tests
shall be recorded and submitted to the city in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
      (1)   Reverse signal capability (duplex network). The grantee shall
provide in original construction a duplex network capable of reverse direction
signals from each and all drops. Carriage capable of reverse direction signal
requirements of the FCC's Third Report and Order.
      (2)   Maintenance. The grantee shall retain a sufficient number of
technically qualified personnel to maintain the network at the quality
specified. Sufficient personnel shall also be either on duty or on call during
all hours of each day to maintain service at all times.
(1981 Code, § 111.15) (Ord. 5055-73, passed 5-14-1973)
§ 111.16 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with standard
utilities practices as detailed in the Edison Electrical Institute Publication
E3 governing joint-use agreement and in the United States Department of
Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, Handbook Number 18, "Safety Rules for
the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communications

         (b)   As used in any section contained in Title XIII of this code that

      (2)   Notwithstanding division (1)(a) of this definition, in no case
shall the portion of the definition of the term PERSON that is set forth in
division (1)(a)2. of this definition be applied or construed in any section
contained in Title XIII of this code that sets forth a criminal offense in any
of the following manners:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (2)(a) of this
definition, in a manner so that the offense prohibits or is construed as
prohibiting any pregnant woman or her physician from performing an abortion
with the consent of the pregnant woman, with the consent of the pregnant woman
implied by law in a medical emergency, or with the approval of one otherwise
authorized by law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant
woman. An abortion that violates the conditions described in the immediately

applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:

            2.   Her causing, in any other manner, the death in utero of a

years after the offense is committed.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (A)(5)(b) and (E)

      (2)   As used in this division:
         OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC
SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or

misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2).
         PUBLIC SERVANT. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is

      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the

or 5 years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (1981 Code, § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish anelement thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (1981 Code, § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than 1 for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (1981 Code, § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (1981 Code, § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to

      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of

§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence as described in division (B)(1)
of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (D) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. Proof of such character that an ordinary
person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of the
person’s own affairs.
      REASONABLE DOUBT. Reasonable doubt is present when the jurors, after they
have carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are
firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable
and common sense. The term is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
      (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the
person previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic
offender for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division
(B) of this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile
traffic offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of
determining the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the
person is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be
imposed upon the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)   Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio river extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio river with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio river and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio river under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,

chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in
§ 130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the

or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that

compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor

general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.21 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 to 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to 2 or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to 2 or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be 1 of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to 1 or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding 1 or more of
those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120 days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of 1 or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed 5 years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol

         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to

vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes 1 or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room

repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(3) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a

or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(4), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(4)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(4)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(4)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (5)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (6)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with 1 or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (7)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (8)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
§ 130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;

         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
§ 130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

of all property or services involved in the offense.

2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §§ 2913.31 or 2913.43
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61
(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. §§ 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C.
§§ 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against 1 victim or more than 1
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant

single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the

required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of 2 or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48,

services involved in all of the offenses in the series of 2 or more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed 1 or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed 1 or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority of an

the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this chapter,
R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the possession of
chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance
included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report from the Bureau
or from any laboratory that is operated or established as described in this
division that is signed by the person performing the analysis, stating that the
substances that are the basis of the alleged offense have been weighed and
analyzed and stating the findings as to the content, weight, and identity of
each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and
weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the

attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (C)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney's receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice, or, if the
accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court,
present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition without any
advertising thereon. The space between such wall or fence and the lot line of

parking area location requirements may be referred to the Board where existing
conditions prevent reasonable compliance to the off-street parking requirements
of the article.
   (C)   Joint use.  Two or more nonresidential uses may jointly provide and
use parking spaces when their hours of operation do not normally overlap,
provided that a written agreement, approved by the Law Director and accepted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be filed with the application for a zoning
certificate.

feet other than that containing the principal use with the approval of the
Board, provided a written agreement, approved by the Law Director and accepted
by the Board, shall be filed with the application for a zoning certificate.
   (E)   Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than 10 vehicles shall
be graded for proper drainage and surfaced so as to provide a durable and dust-
free surface.
   (F)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any R District.
   (G)   Disabled vehicles.  The parking of a disabled vehicle within a
residential district for a period of more than 2 weeks shall be prohibited
except that such vehicle may be stored in an enclosed garage or other accessory
building provided that no business shall be conducted in connection therewith

§ 150.69 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers and it shall be
its duty.
   (A)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of law
in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Inspector in the enforcement of this chapter or any amendments thereto.
   (B)   In hearing and deciding appeals, the Board shall have the power to
grant an exception in the following instances:
      (1)   Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the
passage of this chapter.
      (2)   Interpret provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry out
the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the may fixing the several
districts, accompanying and made a part of this chapter where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map
aforesaid.
      (3)   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy, to the extent
of more than 60% of its fair market value where the Board finds some compelling
necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the primary
purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly.
      (4)   Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship on the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (5)   Permit land within 300 feet of a multiple dwelling to be improved
for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple dwelling, but
only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used for such
purpose during the existence of the multiple dwelling.
      (6)   Determine whether an industry should be permitted within the I-
1 and I-2 Industrial District because of the methods by which it would be
operated and because of its effect upon uses within surrounding zoning
districts.
      (7)   The substitution of a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this chapter, of any other nonconforming use, if no structural
alterations, except those required by law or ordinance, are made: provided,
however, that in an R District, no change shall be authorized by the Board to
any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any R District, and in a
district no change shall be authorized to any use which is not a permitted or
conditional use in any B District.
      (8)   Temporary structures and uses. The temporary use of a structure or
premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed elsewhere in this chapter for the district in which it
is located, provided that such use be of a temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of a substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such
use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for not
more than a 12 month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the
public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
(1981 Code, § 150.69) (Ord. 6570-93, passed 12-13-1993)
§ 150.70 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals and
authorize such variances from the provisions or requirements of this chapter as
will not be contrary to the public interest. In authorizing a variance, the
Board may attach conditions and require such guarantee or bond as it may deem
necessary to assure compliance with the objectives of this chapter. On appeal
where there is unnecessary hardship, the Board may grant a variance in the
application of the provisions of the zoning chapter only if all of the
following findings are made:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstance or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Code and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially permanently impair the appropriate use of development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   (B)   The Board shall have the authority to grant an extension or permit
completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use upon a lot occupied by
such building, or on a lot adjoining, provided that such lot was under the same
ownership as the lot in question on the date such building became
nonconforming, and where such extension is necessary and incidental to the
existing use of such building, provided, however, that the floor areas of such
extension shall not exceed in all 100% of the use and provided further that
such extension or extensions shall be undertaken within 5 years of the date
when the use of such building became nonconforming.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other powers to grant variances in this zoning
code, the Board shall have no authority to grant any variance the effect of
which would be to convert any current single family dwelling into a multiple
family dwelling.
(1981 Code, § 150.70) (Ord. 6570-93, passed 12-13-1993; Am. Ord. 6761-97,

§ 150.71 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Under the authorization granted in R.C. Ch. 713, to hear and decide
special exceptions to the terms of this chapter, the Board shall have the power
to decide applications for conditional uses in those cases specified in
§ 150.15 of this chapter. In considering such application, the Board shall give
due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures; and
may impose such requirements and conditions as the Board may deem necessary for
the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest, including
specific limitations as to future expansion.
   (B)   The following basic standards shall apply to conditional uses in any
district:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its layout and its
relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic to and from the use and assembly of persons in connection
with it will not be hazardous, inconvenient, or conflict with the normal
traffic on residential streets, both at the time and as the same may be
expected to increase with any prospective increase in the population of the
area, taking into account convenient routes of pedestrian traffic, particularly
of children, relation to main traffic thoroughfares and to street
intersections, and the development of the area.
      (2)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature, and
height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the
site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
   (C)   The following basic standards shall apply to conditional uses in any B
or I District.
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout, and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that vehicular
traffic to and from the use will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic
of the district, both at the development of the municipality, taking into
account vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow,
relation to street intersections, sight distances, and relation to pedestrian
traffic.
      (2)   The nature, location, size and site layout of the use shall be such
that it will be a harmonious part of the business or industrial district in
which it is situated, taking into account prevailing shopping habits,
convenience of access by prospective patrons, the physical and economic
relationships of one type of use to another, and characteristic groupings of
uses in a commercial or industrial district.
      (3)   In considering the approval of a group home, the Board shall
consider the dwelling size, the lot size, and the availability of necessary
parking, along with all other considerations listed in divisions (A) and (B) of
this section.
(1981 Code, § 150.71) (Ord. 6570-93, passed 12-13-1993)
§ 150.72 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The Board shall have the power to authorize issuance of a zoning
certificate for uses that are subject to performance requirements as set forth
in this chapter.
   (B)   The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development: a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products, and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used
in meeting the performance requirements.
   (C)   The Board may refer the application to 1 or more expert consultants
qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the
performance requirements. The costs of such services shall be borne by the
applicant, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished the applicant.
(1981 Code, § 150.72) (Ord. 6570-93, passed 12-13-1993)
§ 150.73 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the zoning map, the Board,
after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall
interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
chapter. In case of any questions as to the locations of any boundary line
between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the zoning district
map be made to the Board and a determination shall be made by said Board.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 150.85 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   General objectives. The officials of the municipality concerned with
property development shall take into account that it is increasingly difficult
to forecast the various conditions and factors that may be encountered in
sizeable developments, and that certain latitude, flexibility, and freedom in
the execution of the design and layout of a project should be suggested or
otherwise permitted by the municipality so as to encourage the developer to
adjust the streets to irregular topography; to take advantage of topography in
order to utilize the natural surface drainage; to economize in the construction
of sewers and storm drainage facilities; to reduce the amount of grading and
thus minimize destruction of trees and topsoil; to adjust the layout to
geographical and cultural limitations such as property ownership lines; and,
among other things, to create architectural variation in the development as
well as attractive and usable buildings and building sites; and further such
developments shall be designed so as to enhance the community in general by
providing amenities which are unique to the community.
   (B)   Minimum project area. Planned unit developments may be residential,
commercial or industrial developments, or they may be combinations of uses,
such as residential and commercial, or commercial and industrial. The minimum
site area for a residential development shall be 6 acres; for a commercial
development, 3 acres; and for an industrial development, 10 acres. If a
combination of uses is proposed, a residential-commercial development shall
have a minimum of 15 acres and a commercial- industrial development, a minimum
of 15 acres.
   (C)   Governing provisions. Because of the special characteristics of
planned unit developments, special provisions governing the development of land
for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference
between the provisions of Article IX and those of other articles of this
chapter the provisions of Article IX shall prevail for the development of land
for planned unit developments. Subjects not covered by this article shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this chapter.
Applicable provisions of the city's subdivision regulation shall be adhered to
in the planning and construction of a planned unit development.
   (D)   Uses permitted. Only those uses permitted or conditionally permitted
in each district or interpreted to be included under Article IV of this
ordinance may be proposed for a planned unit development. Compatible
residential, commercial, industrial, public and quasi- public uses may be
combined, provided that the proposed location of the commercial or industrial
uses will not adversely affect adjacent property, and/or the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (E)   Submission of plans. Plans for a planned unit development shall be
submitted to the municipality and shall be referred to the Planning Commission
for study and conducting of a public hearing by Council. Notice and publication
of such public hearings shall conform to the procedures prescribed in Article
XII for hearings on changes and amendments.

location of existing structures, areas of shrubs and/or trees of ten inch
diameter or more, existing contours and the proposed grading plan.
   (B)   Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed planned unit
development project as shown by the preliminary plan conforms to the
requirements of all applicable provisions of this chapter, the proponent shall
prepare and submit a final development plan, and such plan shall incorporate
any changes or modifications required by the Commission.
   (C)   Upon approval by the Commission, the plans shall be submitted to the
Council for consideration and action. The approval and recommendations of the
Commission shall be based on the following general conditions:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter
to promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare and will not have
a significantly adverse effect upon the environment.
      (2)   The use of the land shall be similar to the uses permitted in the
district in which the plan is located.
   (D)   The following information and documents shall be submitted with the
final development plan:

participating in plan preparation; legal description of property; existing use
of property; present and proposed zoning; and vicinity map.
      (2)   A preliminary development plan at a scale approved by the
Commission showing topography at 2 foot intervals for areas with slopes of less
than 25% and at 5 foot intervals for areas with slopes of 25% or more; rights-
of-way, utility easements, parks and community spaces, lay-out and dimensions
of lots and building setback lines; preliminary improvement drawings showing
water, sewer, drainage, electricity, telephone, and natural gas; and such other
characteristics as the Planning Commission deems necessary.
      (3)   A development schedule indicating the anticipated time of
completion for the project as a whole and for separate stages.
      (4)   A statement briefly describing the proposed development and its
relation to the existing and future environment of the area in which the
project is located and an outline of the measures to be taken to minimize
adverse environmental effects during development stages and insure maximum
attainable compatibility with the environment upon project completion.
      (5)   Proposed protective covenants, deed restrictions, and form of
notices to property owners relative to their interests and responsibilities
with respect to open space and recreation facilities.
      (6)   Description of form of organization to be followed in the
establishment of a property owners' association in the event that care and
maintenance of common open space and recreation facilities is to be a
responsibility of property owners.
(1981 Code, § 150.86) (Ord. 6761-97, passed 3-10-97)
§ 150.87 ACCEPTANCE BY ACTION OF COUNCIL.
   (A)   Following a public hearing, the Council may modify the plan,
consistent with the intent and meaning of this chapter, and may rezone the
property to the classification permitting the proposal, for development in
substantial conformity with the final plan as approved by the Council.
   (B)   After the final development plan has been approved by the Council and
in carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights, or yards may be requested by the proponents, and
provided such requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and this chapter, such adjustments or rearrangements may be
authorized by the Commission.

ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 151.141 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE SURETY.
   In order that the city has the assurance that the construction and
installation of such improvements such as street surfacing, curbs, gutters,
storm sewers and appurtenances, sanitary sewer, water lines, sidewalks, street
lighting, street signs, and other required improvements will be constructed,
the subdivider shall provide performance surety.
   (A)   Performance surety.  
      (1)   To get a final plat signed by the Mayor and Clerk before
improvements, the subdivider shall furnish either a bond, executed by a surety
company, cash deposit (certified check) or Irrevocable Letter of Credit (form
must be approved by the City Law Director) equal to the cost of construction of
such improvements as shown on the plans, and based on an estimate approved by
the Engineering Department Supervisor.
      (2)   The performance bond, cash deposit (certified check) or Irrevocable
Letter of Credit to the city shall run for a period of 1 year and be extendable
for 2 years from the date of execution, and shall provide that the subdivider,
his or her heirs, successors and assigns, their agent or servants, will comply
with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these
regulations, and will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing
and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such laws and
regulations. Before said bond is accepted it shall be approved by the City Law
Director. Whenever a cash deposit (certified check) is made, the same shall be
made out to the city.
   (B)   Extension of time. If the construction or installation of any
improvement or facility, for which guarantee has been made by the developer in
the form of bond or cash deposit, is not completed within 2 years from the date
of final approval of the record plat, the developer may request the city to
grant an extension, provided he or she can show reasonable cause for inability
to complete said improvements within the required 2 years.
   (C)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance
of the City Council. The approval by the Planning Commission of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the local
government of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat.
(1981 Code, § 151.141) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.142 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Periodic inspections during the installation of improvements shall be
made by the city to ensure conformity with the approved plans and
specifications as required by these regulations.
   (B)   The subdivider shall notify proper city officials at least 24 hours
before each phase of the improvements is ready for inspection. The presence
and/or absence of an inspector during construction shall not relieve the
subdivider from full responsibility of required improvements to the
Construction Standards and Drawings and the satisfaction of the city. The city
will require improvement inspection fees (see Schedule of Fees - §
151.194).
(1981 Code, § 151.142) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.143 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements, if
required, until approval of said improvements. Once the required public
improvements have been constructed and approved in the subdivision, and prior
to the release of the performance surety, the subdivider shall post with the
city a maintenance surety in the amount of 10% of the performance surety and in
a form as approved by the City Law Director.
   (B)   No public improvements shall be approved until the subdivider has
posted an approved maintenance surety, and this maintenance surety will extend
for 1 year from the actual date that the final punch list has been completed
and approved by the city.
   (C)   Acceptance by the city of the public improvements will not take place
until the city releases the maintenance surety and the Engineering Department
Supervisor receives 1 set of reproducible record drawings of construction
plans, including all utilities (i.e. sanitary sewers, storm sewers, gas, water,
telephone, electricity, and cable television, etc.) drawn at a scale of at
least 1" = 20'. Record drawings shall be stamped by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor verifying the accuracy of the drawings.
   (D)   Prior to release of the maintenance surety by the city, the developer
shall have paid all public improvement fees required by these regulations and
have completed all maintenance punch list items.
(1981 Code, § 151.143) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.144 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final approval,
subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities. Whenever it is deemed necessary
by the Planning Commission to defer the construction of any improvement
required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or
lack of connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay
his or her share of the costs of the future improvements as approved by the
Engineering Department Supervisor and Council to the city prior to signing of
the final subdivision plat.
(1981 Code, § 151.144) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.145 PROCEDURE IN CASE OF FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENT.
   The subdivider shall be in default of this performance surety when one of
the following conditions exist:
   (A)   The installation of all required public improvements as called for in
these regulations has not taken within the 2-year time period agreed upon in
the subdivider's contract with the village, and the subdivider has failed to
establish reasonable cause for such delay to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission and thereby to receive a time extension.
   (B)   The subdivider has not constructed the required public improvements in
accordance with the minimum standards specified in these regulations, and the
subdivider is unwilling to modify and to upgrade said public improvements
within a 6-month time period so as to be in compliance with the provisions of
these regulations.
(1981 Code, § 151.145) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.146 PROCEDURE IN CASE OF DEFAULT.
   The subdivider shall be in default of his or her maintenance surety when the
required public improvements have not been properly maintained over the 1-year
period as established in
§ 151.141 or when the required public improvements are not in accordance with
the "as-built" plans submitted by the subdivider to the city. The same shall
apply whenever construction of improvements is not performed in accordance with
applicable standards and specifications. In such cases of default, the city
shall proceed to utilize the performance surety and/or maintenance surety to
construct the required public improvements to the minimum design standards as
required in these regulations.
(1981 Code, § 151.146) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.147 BUILDING PERMIT.

These design controls shall help ensure convenient and safe streets, creation
of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities, and reservation of
land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional
neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of
unplanned, haphazard growth.
   (B)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing the
design of each future subdivision early in its design development. The Planning
Commission shall ensure that all the requirements of this section and the city
Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings are met.
(1981 Code, § 151.151) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.152 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangements, character, width, and location of all arterial and
collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the adopted
City Comprehensive Development Plan. Thoroughfares not contained in the
aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, based upon the design standards set forth in this section and the
city Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings.
(1981 Code, § 151.152) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.153 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage,
topography, inadequate water supply, and other such conditions which may
endanger health, life, or property; and if from investigations conducted by the
public agencies concerned it is determined that in the best interest of the
public the land should not be developed for the desired purpose, the Planning
Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods
are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by
the development of the land.
(1981 Code, § 151.153) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.154 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.

location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan of
the city, and shall conform to the city Design Criteria and Construction
Standards and Drawings. Street design shall take into consideration their
relationship to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, and
public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. The street pattern shall
discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider
shall provide within the boundaries of the plat, the necessary right-of-way for
the widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the
Comprehensive Development Plan.
   (B)   The subdivider shall improve all streets which are part of the
subdivision, including that portion of the subdivision located on existing
streets. The required improvements shall be such that all items of work are in

Drawings. Existing streets shall be improved so that they meet the above
standards including storm drainage. The subdivider shall pay the full
construction cost for the required improvements.
   (C)   Curbs and gutters shall be required for all streets including existing
streets.
   (D)   Appropriate access to and from any subdivision in the form of a
standard city street with required improvements must be provided by a developer
in instances where development is not located contiguously along an improved
public street right-of-way. No subdivision shall be approved where a parcel,
tract, or lot has frontage only on the "stub end" of a discontinued or dead-end
street. Such street must first be extended or reconstructed as a cul-de-sac in
accordance with these regulations. No subdivision showing reserved strips
controlling the access to public ways will be approved.
   (E)   All street widths shall conform to the city Design Criteria and
Construction Standards and Drawings. In cases where the designation of the
street is in question, the Planning Commission shall determine the type of
street designation.
   (F)   The city shall reimburse the subdivider based on cost in the

possible interference with traffic movement on the streets. The location of
streets and driveways for business developments shall conform to the city
Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings.
(1981 Code, § 151.157) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.158 STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so that no
industrial traffic will be directed into any residential street. Streets shall
be planned to be extended to the boundaries or any adjoining land planned for
industry, except when severe physical conditions exist or if the Planning
Commission finds such extension is not in accordance with the approved plan of
the area. The location of streets and driveways for industrial developments
shall conform to the city Design Criteria and Construction Standards and
Drawings.
(1981 Code, § 151.158) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)

a sidewalk is responsible for curb-ramps at intersections and any sidewalk
located on a public access that may be dedicated to the city at a later time.
Homeowners will be required to install sidewalks on individual properties
within 6 months of finalized building construction (occupation of the
building). Two years after that particular phase of the subdivision is accepted
and once 50% of the lots within that particular phase of the subdivision are
developed, sidewalks must be installed on all lots by whoever owns the
properties. If the sidewalks are not installed, the city will perform the
installation and assess the property owner for all cost incurred.
(1981 Code, § 151.160) (Ord. 6875-98, passed 7-27-1998)
§ 151.161 BLOCKS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of blocks:
   (A)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in this section and to the street design criteria
established in the city Design Criteria and Construction Standards and
Drawings, and shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the
size and character required for the zoning district as set forth in the Zoning
Ordinance and to provide for the required community facilities.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may require that the characteristics of blocks
bear close relation to the use of the land.
   (C)   Irregularly-shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Planning Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance
of interior public spaces is covered by an agreement.
   (D)   No block shall be longer than 1,400 feet nor less than 300 feet and
the block width shall accommodate 2 tiers of lots, except where unusual
topography or other exceptional physical circumstances exist.
   (E)   Where blocks are over 900 feet in length, a public walkway easement
not less than 10 feet in width at or near the half-way point may be required,
if necessary, to provide proper access to schools, recreational areas, and
other facilities. The Planning Commission has the authority to require an
easement of 10 feet, 5 feet from each lot through the tier of 2 lots for
pedestrian access to school, playgrounds, or other facilities. The pavement
width for a sidewalk shall conform to the city Design Criteria and Construction
Standards and Drawings.
   (F)   All block corners shall be rounded with a radius of not less than 25
feet measured at the back of the curb.

   (A)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related topography, and the
character of surrounding development.
   (B)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements for the zoning
district in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
   (C)   All lots shall abut by their full frontage on a publicly-dedicated
street or a street that has received the legal status of such. The minimum lot
size, widths, and setbacks shall be as specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)   All side lot lines shall be as close to right angles as possible to
the street line and radial to curved street lines, except where the Planning
Commission determines that a variation to this rule would provide a better
layout.
   (E)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Planning
Commission determines it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
   (F)   All corner lots shall have front yard setbacks on both streets and
lots shall be of an area sufficient to permit adequate building sites.
   (G)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three times its
average width, nor shall it have a depth of less than 110 feet except that,
whenever a lot fronts upon an exterior curved portion of a street, lot depth
may be reduced to not less than 100 feet.
   (H)   In the case of vacation of lots, or parts of lots, in the city
previously recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Van Wert County, Ohio, the
same procedure, rules and regulations shall apply as for a new plat, except
that a preliminary plat may not be required. The title of the vacation plat
shall indicate what is being vacated, and the final plat shall include enough
of the surrounding plat or plats to show its relations to adjoining areas.
   (I)   Whenever a subdivider or developer proposes a re-subdivision of a plat
previously recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Van Wert County, Ohio he
shall follow the same procedures as for a new plat, except that a preliminary

   (A)   A survey shall be made by a registered surveyor and shall conform to
the"Minimum Standards for Boundary Surveys in the State of Ohio".
   (B)   Permanent markers shall be set at all exterior subdivision boundary
corners and intersections of change, at the point of curvature and point of
tangent of all curves, and where the radius of direction changes. The intent is
to identify and establish all lines of the plat. All monuments or permanent
markers shall be placed with plastic caps at all property corners prior to city
acceptance of improvements. Property pins shall also be set with plastic caps
prior to approval of the site plan for all individual building permits.
   (C)   Monument boxes with permanent markers shall be set at all street
intersections and on all points of intersection. If the points of intersection
are not in the paved area of the street, the monument boxes with permanent
markers shall be placed at the point of curvature and point of tangent of all
curves.
   (D)   All monuments and permanent markers shall be set as shown on the final
plat. The size, location, and type of material used shall also be shown. A
professional surveyor's affidavit shall be filed in the plat volume and cross-
referenced with the original plat when, for any reason, a monument or permanent
marker must be offset from the original location or the type of permanent
marker is changed.
   (E)   Boundary lines shall be monumented at all points where there is a
change of direction and at all lot corners by suitable monuments as specified
in the "Minimum Standards for Boundary Surveys in the State of Ohio."

the public nuisance at the owner's expense. The Building Commissioner may also
order the owner to take such measures as are reasonably necessary to lessen the
severity of the public nuisance. If the owner fails or refuses to comply with
such order, the city may abate or lessen the public nuisance's severity through
rehabilitation, repair, or removal of the building, structure, or nuisances at
the owner's expense. Abatement by the owner shall, on the issuance of a special
nuisance abatement permit or special demolition permit, start 15 days after
service of such notice and shall complete within the time prescribed in §
152.84 or such additional time as the Building Commissioner may deem necessary
to complete the abatement.
   (B)   Whenever the Building Commissioner determines the existence of a
public nuisance as defined in §
152.75, the Building Commissioner or designee shall serve a written notice on
the owner and/or other responsible person, stating the findings with respect to
the existence of a public nuisance and ordering the owner and/or other
responsible person, to abate the public nuisance within 15 days. Whenever the
issues raised by the written notice and order have been finally determined, the
Building Commissioner may recommend to the Safety Service Director the
abatement of the public nuisance in the manner provided R.C. Chapter 3767. Upon
the Zoning Administrator's recommendation, the Safety Service Director shall
determine if such assistance is warranted and may authorize the Law Director to
pursue the same. If the owner and/or other responsible person fails or refused
to comply with the order to abate the public nuisance, the Building
Commissioner may, in addition to proceeding as provided hereinabove, proceed
against the owner for any violations of the Building Code.

§ 152.83 PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE BY ACTIVITY OR USE.
   (A)    Whenever the Building Commissioner suspects the existence of a public
nuisance in the city as defined by §
152.75, the Building Commissioner or a designee shall, with the assistance of
the Police Department (if necessary), promptly inspect the premises on which
the public nuisance is suspected to exist. Should the Building Commissioner
find that a public nuisance does exist; it shall be the duty of the Building
Commissioner or a designee to file with the city a written report of the finds
along with any documented previous activity on file with the Police Department.
The Building Commissioner shall notify the owner pursuant to §
152.84(B)(2), (3), or (4), and the notice shall state the findings with respect
to the existence of a public nuisance and order the owner to take such measures
as are reasonably necessary to lessen the severity of the public nuisance.
   (B)   Whenever the Building Commissioner, with assistance from the Police
Department (if necessary), determines that the continued existence of a
previously identified public nuisance as defined in §
152.75 remains, the Building Commissioner or designee may serve a written
notice on the owner and/or other responsible person, stating the findings with
respect to the existence of public nuisance, and ordering the owner and/or
other responsible person, to abate the public nuisance within 15 days. Whenever
the issues raised by the written notice and order have been finally determined,
the Building Commissioner may recommend to the Safety Service Director the
abatement of the public nuisance in the manner provided in R.C. Chapter 3767.
Upon the Building Commissioner's recommendation, the Safety Service Director
shall determine if such assistance is warranted, and may authorize the Law
Director to pursue the same. If the owner and/or other responsible person fails
or refuses to comply with the order to abate the public nuisance, the Building
Commissioner may, in addition to proceeding as provided hereinabove, proceed
against the owner for any violation of the Building Code.

§ 152.85 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY OWNER.
   (A)   On being served notice of a public nuisance as defined in §
152.75, the owner may, within 15 days after receipt of notice, apply in writing
to the Building Commissioner for a temporary special nuisance abatement permit
to abate the public nuisance. Upon reviewing the Zoning Permit application, the
Building Commissioner shall issue the temporary special nuisance abatement
permit, which shall state the time frame of 30 days, during which time the
applicant must either abate the nuisance or make application to the city for
such additional permits as may be necessary to abate the nuisance.
   (B)   The owner shall furnish to the city adequate plans and specifications
as required to cover the repairs or replacements.
   (C)   Upon receipt of the building permit, the applicant shall apply for
permanent special nuisance abatement permit from the city. This permit shall be
valid for a period of 90 days and within that time the owner shall begin the
repairs or replacements to abate the nuisance. The Building Commissioner may
grant an extension to the special nuisance abatement permit, in writing if the
owner shows reason or cause for the requested extension and the extension will
more readily affect the repairs and/or replacements.
   (D)   Whenever permits are issued for repairs to the plumbing, electrical,
heating and air conditioning, or similar systems in a nuisance structure, such
permits shall be valid for a period of time not to exceed the unexpired term of
the special nuisance abatement permit, or extension thereof, pursuant to
subsection (c) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code
to the contrary. In the event the said permits are issued for work which
exceeds that which is necessary for the abatement of the nuisance, and if the
nuisance is abated within the time provided in subsection (c) of this section,
then the said permits shall remain valid, subject to the terms, provisions and
limitations of the Building Code.
   (E)   On being served notice, the owner may within 15 days apply in writing
or in person to Code Enforcement for a demolition permit to abate the nuisance
completely by demolition and removal of the structure. The demolition permitted
by the permit shall begin within 30 days from issuing the permit.
