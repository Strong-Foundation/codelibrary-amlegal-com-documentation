   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, are before
the Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF ORANGE VILLAGE, CUYAHOGA
COUNTY, STATE OF OHIO:
   SECTION 1. That pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23 and 731.42, the ordinances of

rearranged and consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections
are hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Orange,

inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance except as follows:
(a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to affect
a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provisions prior
to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or proceeding for the
enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be construed
to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in violation of any
such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or prosecution
therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in
full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and
codification.
(b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

passage of this legislation were adopted in an open meeting of this Council and
that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that
resulted in such formal action were in meetings open to the public, in
compliance with all legal requirements including Chapter 105 of the Codified
Ordinances of Orange Village (prior Chapter 206 of the Village Code of

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Orange Codified Ordinances were
ordinances previously enacted by Council. Unless otherwise indicated, sections
of the Codified Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections
contain new matter ordained by the previous Adopting Ordinance of the
individual Code. In the following table, the disposition of all source material
in the Orange Codified Ordinances is indicated.

in some form other than that set forth in the petition therefor, the
petitioners, through the Committee named on such petition, may, at the next
regular meeting of Council, request in writing that it be submitted to a vote
of the electors. Thereupon, Council shall provide for submitting the petitioned

within twenty (20) days after the filing thereof, certify the particulars in
which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of that certificate to the
Committee named on the petition, return the entire petition to such Committee

sufficient and refile it as an originally filed petition with the Clerk.
SECTION VII-4. RECALL.

persons constituting the Petitioners' Committee filing the petition and the
date of such filing. The petition shall be signed by at least that number of
qualified electors which equals twenty percent (20%) of the total electors
voting at the last preceding general election. Within ten (10) days after the
date on which such petition is filed, the Clerk shall determine its
sufficiency. If the Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, he or she shall
within ten (10) days after the date of filing thereof, certify the particulars
in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of that certificate to the
Committee named in that petition and make a record of the delivery. Such
Committee shall then be allowed a period of ten (10) days after the day on

originally filed petition with the Clerk. If the Clerk shall find the petition
sufficient, he or she shall within ten (10) days after the date of filing
thereof, so certify to Council, deliver a copy of such certificate to the
officer whose removal is sought, and made a record of that delivery. If such
officer shall not resign within five (5) days after the day on which such
delivery is made, Council shall thereupon schedule a recall election, to be
held at the next regularly scheduled primary or general election occurring not
less than seventy-five (75) days after the date of such delivery. At such
recall election this question shall be placed on the ballot: “Shall (naming the
officer) be removed from office (naming the office) of Orange Village”? with
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such
question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be voted
negatively, the officer shall remain in office. If a majority of the votes cast
shall be voted affirmatively, the officer shall be considered removed, the
office shall be deemed vacant, and the vacancy shall be filled as provided in
this Charter. The officer removed by such election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to

Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on eastern daylight savings time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
daylight savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of Ohio.

identified by such person, is to be discussed at such meeting.
   (b)   Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may be given

(Ord. 1989-13. Passed 7-12-89.)
105.07 NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (a)   The action of any Municipal body purposely to fail to comply with the
provisions of this chapter shall invalidate any action not taken in compliance
with this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, "purposely" and
"purposeful" shall mean an act complying with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
2901.22(A).
   (b)   (1)   Any person may bring an action to enforce the provisions of
Section
105.08. Upon proof of a purposeful violation or threatened purposeful violation
of an action brought by any person, the court of common pleas shall issue an
injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions.
(2)   If the court of common pleas issues an injunction pursuant to this
section, the court may award to the party that sought the injunction all court
costs and reasonable attorney's fees and also shall order the public body that
it enjoins to pay a civil forfeiture of one hundred dollars ($100.00). If the
court of common pleas does not issue an injunction pursuant to this section and
the court determines at that time that the bringing of the action was frivolous
conduct as defined in Ohio R.C. 2323.51(A), the court may award to the public
body all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
(3)   Irreparable harm and prejudice to the party that sought the injunction

pursuant to this subsection may be removed from office by the prosecuting
attorney or the attorney general.
   (c)   In no event shall the Clerk, administrative personnel or other

liability on account of the failure of any Municipal official or employee or
any Municipal body to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

105.08 PUBLIC MEETINGS OF MUNICIPAL BODIES.
   (a)   All meetings of any Municipal body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times.
   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such Municipal body shall
be promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only
reflect the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions
authorized under subsection (b) hereof.
(Ord. 1989-13. Passed 7-12-89.)
   (b)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(7) hereof, the members of a
Municipal body may hold an executive session only after a majority of a quorum
of the Municipal body determines, by a roll call vote, to hold such a session
and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the
consideration of any of the following matters:
(1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no Municipal body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office. If a Municipal body holds an
executive session pursuant to subsection (b)(1) hereof, the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
purposes listed in subsection (b)(1) hereof are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
(2)   To consider the purchase, acquisition or disposal of property for public
purposes, and/or for the acquisition, disposal or sale of property at
competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information would give an
unfair business, competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
of a Municipal body shall use this subsection as a subterfuge for providing
covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of
public property is voidable at the option of the Village if the seller or buyer
of the public property has received covert information from a member of a
Municipal body that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient
time for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   If the minutes of the Municipal body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the Municipal body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instruments executed by the Municipal body purporting to convey,
lease or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned;
(3)   Conferences with an attorney for the Municipal body concerning disputes
involving the Municipal body that are the subject of pending or prospective
litigation;
(4)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
(5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or State
statutes or rules;
(6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
      (7)   If a Municipal body holds an executive session to consider any of
the matters listed in subsections (b)(2) to (7) hereof, the decision to hold
that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters
listed in those subsections are to be considered at the executive session.
   (c)   All resolutions, rules or formal actions of any kind shall be adopted
in open meetings of Municipal bodies.
(Ord. 1989-13. Passed 7-12-89.)

105.09(b) of the Codified Ordinances, the following rules shall apply:

Code, members of a Municipal Body who attend meetings or hearings by means of
Electronic Technology shall be considered present as that member were
physically present the meeting or hearing, shall be permitted to vote, and
shall be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
meeting or hearing.
      (3)    Municipal Bodies shall provide notification ofmeetings and
hearings held under this section to the public, to the media that have
requested notification of a meeting, and to the parties required to be notified
of a hearing, at least twenty-four hours in advance of the meeting or hearing
by reasonable methods by which any person may determine the time, location, and
the manner by which the meeting or hearing will be conducted, except in the
event of an emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an
emergency, the Municipal Body shall immediately notify the news media that have
requested notification, or the parties required to be notified of a hearing of
the time, place, and purpose of the meeting or hearing.

public would otherwise be entitled to attend, commensurate with the method in
which the meeting or hearing is being conducted, including, but not limited to,
examples such as live streaming by means of the internet, local radio,
television, cable, or public access channels, call in information for a
teleconference, or by means of any other similar Electronic Technology. The
Municipal Body shall ensure that the public can observe and hear the
discussions and deliberations of all the members of the Municipal Body, whether
the member is participating in person or via Electronic Technology.
      (5)    When members of a Municipal Body conduct a hearing by means of
Electronic Technology, the public body must establish a means, through the use
of electronic equipment that is widely available to the general public, to
converse with witnesses, and to receive documentary testimony and physical
evidence.
      (6)    The authority granted in this section applies notwithstanding to
any conflicting provision of the Ohio Revised Code.

Village;
      (7)   Used Equipment. The proposed purchase is for used equipment;

necessity of action prior to the next meeting of Council. Further, all written
authorizations for such expenditures shall be announced at the next regular or
special meeting of Council by the Mayor, and such announcement shall include a

this period invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted,
unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual
consent of the Village and the bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with
respect to whom the Village subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such
an agreed extension shall not entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (l)   Withdrawal of Bids.  Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant Section 9.31
of the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the Village's
right to award to the next lowest and best bidder.

of the amount of the bid as compared to the estimated cost.
   (n)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to

the contract. The Village shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time
that it determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract
for its convenience.
   (o)   Retainage.  Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
contractor at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage
shall not be held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such

single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.

discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (s)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a bonus

109.01 POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Orange Village, Ohio, (the “Village”) to adhere to
Ohio’s Public Records Act, Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code and related
Sections. Terms used but not defined in this Public Records Policy are used as
defined in those Sections and applicable case law.
(Ord. 2007-34. Passed 10-10-07.)
109.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Records are organized and maintained so that they can be made available for
inspection and copying in accordance with the Public Records Act. The Village’s
record retention schedule is maintained in accordance with Section 149.39 of
the Ohio Revised Code and a copy of the current records retention schedule is
kept in a location readily available to the public. A copy of this Public
Records Policy has been distributed to the Village employee who is the records
custodian or manager or otherwise has custody of the records of the Village,
and a poster that describes this Public Records Policy has been posted in a
conspicuous place in all Village locations where public records are available.
(Ord. 2007-34. Passed 10-10-07.)
109.03 REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   No specific language or form of request, is required, but the request
must not be ambiguous or overly broad. If the requester is unable to make, or
has difficulty in making, a request which will permit the Village to reasonably
identify the records requested, the Village shall permit the requester to
revise the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the
Village keeps its records in the ordinary course of the Village’s duties. If
the requester fails or is unable to revise the request so that it is not
ambiguous or overly broad, the Village may deny the request in accordance with
Section 149.43(B)(2) of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   The Village will ask that a request be made in writing, that the
requester’s identity be disclosed or that the requester’s intended use be
disclosed only (1) after informing the requester that the requester may decline
and (2) when a written request or disclosure of identity or intended use would
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the Village to identify,
locate or deliver the public records sought. Unless specifically required by
state or federal law or as provided above, the Village will not limit or
condition the availability of public records by requiring disclosure of the
requester’s identity or intended use.
   (c)   Upon request, all public records responsive to the request will be
promptly prepared and made available for inspection at all reasonable times
during regular business hours of the Village office that has custody of the
requested records. The Village is not required to permit a person who is
incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to
inspect or obtain copies of any public record concerning a criminal
investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal
investigation or prosecution if the subject were an adult unless the request
complies with Section 149.43(B)(8) of the Ohio Revised Code. Upon request,
copies of the requested public record will be made available at the Village’s
actual cost within a reasonable period of time. “Promptly” and “reasonable
period of time” will take into account relevant factors including the volume of
records requested, the proximity of the location where the records are stored
and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
   (d)   Upon deposit of the Village’s estimated actual cost of copies and of
the Village’s estimated cost of postage or delivery and for supplies used in
mailing, delivery or transmission, the Village shall make and transmit the
requested copies, as applicable. No requester may make copies of public records
kept by the Village without the written consent of the Village. The requester
may choose to have a public record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium
upon which the Village keeps the public record, or upon any other medium upon
which the Village determines that the public record reasonably can be
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operation of the Village. Upon
request, the Village will transmit a copy of a public record by United States
mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission within a reasonable time
after receiving the request.
   (e)   If a public record contains information that is exempt from the duty
to permit public inspection or to copy the public records, the Village will
make available all information within the public record that is not exempt and
will notify the requester of any redaction of exempt information or make the
redaction plainly visible. If a request is denied, in whole or in part,
including by redaction under this Section
109.03(e), the Village will provide the requester with an explanation,
including legal authority, setting forth why the request was denied. If the
initial request was provided in writing, the explanation shall be provided in
writing.
      (Ord. 2007-34. Passed 10-10-07.)
109.04 COSTS.
   A requestor will be charged the actual cost of the copies of the public
record, including the cost of any medium onto which the record is copied (e.g.
the cost of a floppy disc), and any postage or mailing costs. Copies made by
the Village on a Village copier will be charged at five cents ($.05) per page,
except that a request which is for ten (10) or fewer pages shall be provided at
no charge. If cost of the requested is estimated by the Treasurer or Clerk of
Council to be ten dollars ($10.00) or more, a deposit in the amount of the
estimated cost shall be paid to the Village before the copies are made.

each Eligible Investment held by such qualified trustee. In lieu of such

147.04 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS.
   (a)    Private Deferred Compensation. Council hereby adopts and ratifies a
private deferred compensation plan, as offered by a life insurance company
licensed to transact business in Ohio (hereinafter “private plan”) and extends
to all eligible employees the opportunity to join and participate in such plan.
This private plan was known as the “ING” or “Aetna” plan, and is now offered by
“VOYA Financial”. Any subsequent merger, acquisition or other corporate
activity which results in a name change of the company offering the plan shall
be reviewed by the administration and shall be authorized by this section,
provided that it does not materially change the private plan. A copy of the
private plan shall be maintained on file in the office of the Clerk of Council
and, along with any amendments thereto, and is incorporated herein by
reference.
      (1)   The Mayor is hereby authorized by Council to execute an agreement
with the private plan provider on terms and conditions substantially in
accordance with the plan currently on file in the office of the Clerk of
Council; such agreement shall authorize the Village to offer to its eligible
employees and officials participation in the deferred compensation plan.
         (Ord. 2023-19. Passed 11-8-23.)
 
   (b)   Ohio Public Employees Plan. The Village hereby adopts a Plan under the
Ohio Public Employees' Deferred Compensation Program, and shall properly
contract with any "eligible employee" who desires to participate in the Plan.
Orange Village's Plan shall be the uniform Plan as promulgated by the Board,
whether by the Ohio Administrative Code or otherwise, and consistent with the
Program Adoption Agreement executed by the Village.
      (1)   The Board is hereby authorized to administer the Plan under the
Program, and to do all things necessary or proper for the administration of the
Plan, consistent with the enabling statutes and all the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Board, whether by the Ohio Administrative Code or otherwise,
and consistent with the Program Adoption Agreement executed by the Village.
      (2)   The Mayor is authorized and directed by this Council to execute the
Program Adoption Agreement.
      (3)   Consistent with the Program Adoption Agreement and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Board, the proper officials, officers, employees
and agents of Orange Village are authorized to provide the Board with any
information they may properly require for the administration of the Plan under
the program.
   (c)   Other Deferred Compensation Plans. In addition to the Plans identified
in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, additional Plan administrators may be
selected by the administration, from time to time, and approved by motion of
Council and made available to Village employees. The selection of a Plan by the
Village is not an endorsement or recommendation of a Plan, and employees may
choose any plan at their own risk. The Mayor and the Treasurer are authorized
to take any action that may be necessary to provide for participation in the
Plans, and the Mayor is authorized to consent to the adoption of any
restatements and/or amendments to the Plans provided that such restatements and
amendments do not materially change the Plans. A current copy of any Plan is

147.05 HEALTH INSURANCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
147.05 was repealed by Ordinance 2002-58, passed March 5, 2003.)
147.06 EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OP&F.
   (a)   Effective January 1, 1993, the full amount of the statutorily required
contributions to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension (“OP&F”) shall be withheld
from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes established in
subsection (b) hereof and shall be “picked up”, i.e., assumed and paid to the
OP&F, by Orange Village. This “pick up” by Orange Village is, and shall be
designated as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the OP&F by each person within any of the classes established
in subsection (b) hereof. No person subject to the “pick up” shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the OP&F
directly instead of having it “picked up” by Orange Village or of being
excluded from the “pick up.”
   Orange Village shall, in reporting and making remittance to the OP&F report
that the public employee’s contribution for each person subject to this “pick
up” has been made as provided by the statute.
   (b)   The “pick up” by Orange Village provided by this section shall apply
to all persons that are full time employees of Orange Village Police Department
who are or become contributing members of the OP&F.
   (c)   The Village’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in OP&F is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for a
salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to OP&F:
   The total salary for each eligible employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under the Village’s policies. Such total salary of each employee shall
be payable by the Village in two parts:
      (1)   Deferred salary, and
      (2)   Cash salary.
   An eligible employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of
that employee’s total salary which is required from time to time by OP&F to be
paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be paid by the
Village to OP&F on behalf of that employee as a pick- up and in lieu of the
OP&F employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. Such employee’s
cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total salary less the amount of
the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable
payroll deductions, to that employee. The Village shall compute and remit its
employer or contributions to OP&F based upon an employee’s total salary. The
total combined expenditures of the Village for such employee’s total salaries
payable under Village policies and the pick-up provisions of this section shall
not be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this
provision not been in effect.
   (d)   The Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the “pick up” of the statutorily
required contributions to the OP&F for those employees designated in subsection
(b) hereof so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax
deferments and other benefits.
(Ord. 2013-3. Passed 2-13-13.)
147.07 PICK-UP OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATE PERS.
   (a)   Effective January 1, 1993, the full amount of the statutorily required
contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) shall be
withheld from the gross pay of each person that is a full time employee of
Orange Village who is or becomes a contributing member to PERS, and shall be
“picked up”, i.e., assumed and paid to PERS by Orange Village. This “pick up”
by Orange Village is, and shall be designated as, public employee contributions
and shall be in lieu of contributions to PERS by each full time employee. No
person subject to this “pick up” shall have the option of choosing to receive
the statutorily required contribution to PERS directly, instead of having it
“picked up” by Orange Village, or of being excluded from the “pick up.”
   (b)   Effective January 1, 2000, the full amount of the statutorily required
contributions to PERS shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person that
is a part time employee of Orange Village who is or becomes contributing
members to PERS, and shall be “picked up”, i.e., assumed and paid to PERS, by
Orange Village. This “pick up” by Orange Village is, and shall be designated
as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to PERS
by each part time employee. No person subject to this “pick up” shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to PERS
directly, instead of having it “picked up” by Orange Village, or of being
excluded from the “pick up.”
   (c)   The Village’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in PERS is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for a
salary reduction pick up of employee contributions to PERS:
      (1)   The total salary for each eligible employee shall be the salary
otherwise payable under the Village policies. Such total salary of each
employee shall be payable by the Village in two parts:
         A.   deferred salary; and
         B.   cash salary.
      (2)   An eligible employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that
percentage of that employee’s total salary which is required from time to time
by PERS to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be
paid by the Village to PERS on behalf of that employee as a pick up and in lieu
of PERS employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee.
      (3)   Such employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total
salary less the amount of the pick up for that employee, and shall be payable,
subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (4)   The Village shall compute and remit its employer contributions to
PERS based upon an employee’s total salary. The total combined expenditures of
the Village for such employee’s total salaries payable under applicable Village
policies and the pick up provisions of this section shall not be greater than
the amounts the employee would have been paid for those items had this
provision not been in effect.
   (d)   The Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the “pick up” of the statutorily
required contributions to PERS for those employees designated in subsection (a)
and (b) hereof so as to enable them to obtain the result of Federal and State
tax deferments and other benefits. The Treasurer shall, in reporting and making
remittance to PERS, report that the public employee’s contribution for each
person subject to this “pick up” has been made as provided by statute.

following rules:
   (a)   Each full time employee shall earn one hundred twenty (120) hours of
sick leave per year, prorated over each pay period during the year. In the
event the employee is suspended without pay, his/her sick leave shall be
reduced by 0.0575 hours for every hour of work missed due to suspension.
Overtime and paid time off (i.e. holidays and vacations) shall have no effect
upon the calculation of sick leave.
      (Ord. 2014-16. Passed 10-1-14.)
   (b)   Sick leave shall be defined as an absence with pay necessitated by
illness of or injury to the employee or the employee’s immediate family member
living with the employee, or exposure by the employee to a contagious disease
communicable to other employees. (Ord. 2016-34. Passed 1-11-17.)
   (c)   The sick leave herein provided shall apply to scheduled work days
only.
   (d)   The sick leave herein provided for shall be cumulative without limit.
Cumulative means the accumulations of all unused sick leave for any number of
years.
   (e)   An employee who is absent on sick leave shall notify his supervisor or
designee of such absence and the reason therefor prior to start of his work
shift each day he is to be absent. At least two hours prior notification is
required.
   (f)   Sick leave may be used in segments of not less than one hour.
   (g)   Before an absence may be charged against accumulated sick leave, the
Mayor or the Mayor’s designee may require such proof of illness or injury as
may be satisfactory to him/her or may require the employee to be examined by a
physician designated by the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee and paid by the
Village.
   (h)   If the employee fails to submit adequate proof of illness or injury
upon request of the Mayor or the Mayor’s designee, or in the event that upon
such proof as is submitted or upon report of medical examination, the Mayor or
the Mayor’s designee, finds that there is not satisfactory evidence of illness
or injury sufficient to justify the employee’s absence, such leave may be
considered an unauthorized leave and shall be without pay.
   (i)   An abuse of sick leave or the patterned use of sick leave shall be
just and sufficient cause for discipline as may be determined by the Mayor or
the Mayor’s designee.
   (j)   The Mayor or the Mayor’s designee may require an employee who has been
absent due to personal illness or injury, prior to and as a condition of his/
her return to duty, to be examined by a physician and paid for by the Village,
to establish that he/she is not disabled from the performance from his/her
normal duties and that upon his/her return to duty will not jeopardize the
health and safety of the other employee.
   (Ord. 1998-26. Passed 4-15-98.)
   (k)   For employees hired on or prior to January 1, 1998, and effective
January 1, 1998, two Sick Leave Banks shall be established. Bank 1 shall
contain any and all accrued and unused sick leave through December 31, 1997,
and shall be frozen. Bank 2 shall contain any and all accrued and unused sick
leave hours commencing January 1, 1998. Effective January 1, 1998, employees
described in this subsection who use approved sick leave hours shall have these
hours deducted from Bank 1 until it is exhausted. At that time Bank 1 shall
cease to exist for such employees and the terms and conditions of sick leave
hours usage and payment shall be administered as Bank 2 hours.
   (Ord. 1998-54. Passed 7-8-98.)
   (l)   For employees hired on or after January 1, 1998, any and all sick
leave hours accrued and/or used shall be administered as Bank 2 hours.
   (m)   Employees who have accumulated and unused sick leave hours in Bank 1
shall at the time of retirement or death be paid a lump sum for such sick leave
hours up to a maximum of 120 days (960 hours) based on the daily based pay of
the employee, exclusive of overtime, at the time of his retirement or death.
For the purposes of this section an employee shall be deemed to be retired when
he/she applies for and obtains a disability or retirement pension under any
pension plan afforded such employee as a result of his/her public employment.
   (n)   Employees who have unused sick leave hours in Bank 2 at the time
retirement from active full-time service with the Village and with ten or more
years of continuous service with the Village, shall be paid in cash for one-
third (1/3) of the employee’s accrued but unused sick leave, up to a maximum
accrual of 960 hours or a maximum payout of 320 hours. The dollar value of sick
day shall be based on (a) employee’s annual base salary of 320 hours. The
dollar value of sick days shall be based on (a) employee’s annual base salary
at time of retirement, and (b) a work
year of fifty-two weeks and five days per week. For this calculation paid
vacation days and holidays are considered work days. Payment for sick leave on
this basis shall be considered to eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by
the employee at that time. This section shall only apply to the retirement of
full-time Village employees pursuant to state retirement laws and shall not be
deemed applicable to any removal, voluntary or involuntary resignation, or any
other like termination except a retirement as set forth herein.
      (Ord. 1998-26. Passed 4-15-98.)
   (o)   Employees hired on or after January 1, 1998, shall, as a term and
condition of employment, be required to waive any previously accumulated sick
leave credit from public service outside Orange Village, unless otherwise
requested by the Mayor and approved by an ordinance of Council. If awarded at
the time of hire, any previously accumulated sick leave credit from public
service outside Orange Village shall not be subject to any payout provision
contained in this Section.
   (p)   The Mayor may recommend additional or revised sick leave that is
different than the leave provided for in this Section. Such additional or
revised sick benefit may be granted by a motion and the affirmative vote of at

**The maximum days available listed in Column 3 are those days earned in the
prior
calendar year by the employee.
      (2)   A newly hired full-time employee may earn a maximum of five (5)
vacation days from the first day of employment through December 31 of the year
hired (Year 0) using the following calculation:
         One-half (½) day earned per each full month worked (up to a maximum of
five (5) days)
         Days earned from the above calculation) may not be utilized until
January 1 of the following calendar year (Year 1 ). For example, a new full-
time employee hired September 1 who works through December 31 of that calendar
year will have earned two (2) vacation days for use after January 1. Beginning
January 1, this employee will then be moved to Year 1 under the table above and
the maximum days to be earned in Year 1 (to be used in Year 2) will be ten
(10), with the days available for the employee to use in Year 1 equal to the
number earned in Year 0.
      (3)   In any calendar year, a full-time employee may only take those
vacation days earned in the prior calendar year. Under no circumstances shall
an employee be allowed to take vacation days earned in the current calendar
year during the current calendar year.
      (4)   Prior full-time service with the State of Ohio or any political
subdivision thereof shall be deemed to be prior service with Orange Village in
calculating the amount of the employee's vacation only.
         A.   For example, an employee hired with four (4) years of full-time
prior service with another political subdivision will be placed at Year 4 on
the table above on his/her date of hire. The employee will be credited on his/
her date of hire with days in Year 3 (Column 3) using the following formula:
               # of maximum days in Year 3 (Column 3) divided by twelve (12)
multiplied by the number of full months in the current calendar year from date
of hire through December 31. This will be the number of days of vacation a new
hire with prior service would receive in the year hired.
         B.   During Year 4, the employee will be able to earn (Column 2) the
maximum number of days available for Year 5.
   (c)   Use of Vacation Leave. 
      (1)   Vacation leave may be used starting January 1 of the calendar year
after it is accrued. Use of vacation leave shall be in minimum increments of
four (4) hours and is subject to the approval of the employee's Department Head
and the Mayor or his/her designee.
      (2)   Requests for vacation leave must be submitted via Time Off Policy
Form or on the appropriate leave form to the Department Head in a reasonable
time frame prior to the day(s) requested off.
      (3)   Vacation leave may be denied during a specific period if the
workload dictates.
      (4)   All vacation time shall be taken at a time approved by the Mayor or
his/her designee.
      (5)   Vacation time cannot be accumulated and must be taken by December
31 of the year after it is earned. In the event of a hardship, as reasonably
defined by the Mayor or his/her designee, unused vacation time may be paid to
the employee at the employee's usual hourly rate in the year in which it should
have been taken or the vacation may be rolled over into the following calendar
year as approved by the Mayor or his/her designee so long as it is used in the
first quarter of the following year.
   (d)   Payment for Unused Vacation Leave at Time of Termination.
      (1)   Upon separation from employment for any reason other than a
disciplinary termination for cause, each full-time employee may be paid a
proration for earned and unused vacation time available in the current year
(Column 3), and a pro-rated percentage of vacation time earned for the
subsequent year (Column 2), based upon the full months actually worked in the
current year through the date of separation in accordance with the table above.
If an employee voluntarily terminates employment the employee must give
fourteen (14) days written notice to receive the accumulated vacation pay or it
is forfeited.
         A.   For example, if an employee in Year 4 under the table above
resigns effective March 1, they shall be entitled to be paid the number of
unused vacation days earned the prior calendar year (from Column 3) plus the
number of vacation days earned from January 1 through February 28 prorated
based on the table above (Column 2) (i.e., two and one-half (2.5) days).
      (2)   Upon a disciplinary termination for cause, each full-time employee
shall be entitled to payment for earned and unused vacation time available in
the current year (Column 3).
         A.   For example, if an employee in Year 4 is terminated for cause
effective March 1, they shall be entitled to be paid for the number of unused
vacation days earned the prior calendar year (from Column 3).
      (3)   In the event of the termination of employment with the Village for
any reason except for cause, each full-time employee may be paid a proration of
accrued vacation time based upon the full months actually worked during the
year of termination.
         (Ord. 2023-19. Passed 11-8-23.)
147.14 HOLIDAY TIME/PERSONAL DAYS.

Fire Department,
and who in fact work that shift.
   (e)    Personal Days are "advanced" and available for use by eligible
employees in the first pay period of each year. Upon termination, personal time
shall be pro-rated for the number of full months actually worked during the
year and final paycheck will be adjusted accordingly.
Employees hired during the year shall have their personal time pro-rated based
on the date hired.

147.22 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Policy. It is the policy of Orange Village that all employees should
be able to enjoy a work environment free from all forms of discrimination,
including sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of misconduct that
undermines the integrity of the employment relationship. No employee, either
male or female, should be subjected to unsolicited and unwelcome sexual
overtures or conduct, either verbal or physical. Sexual harassment does not
refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to
behavior that is not welcome, that is personally offensive, that lowers morale
and that, therefore, interferes with employee effectiveness. Specifically, no
person shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that an
employee’s refusal to submit to sexual advances will adversely affect the
employee’s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts,
or any other condition of employment or career development.
   (b)   Education Procedure. Each supervisor has a responsibility to maintain
the workplace free of sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this
policy with all employees and assuring them that they are not to endure
insulting, degrading, or exploitive sexual treatment.
      (1)   Upon the effective date hereof, each supervisor shall distribute a
copy of this policy to each employee in his or her department and obtain a
written acknowledgment of receipt, which shall be placed in that employee’s
personnel file.
      (2)   Each new hire shall receive a copy of this policy and sign a
written acknowledgment of receipt which shall be placed in the employee’s
personnel file.
   (c)   Complaint Procedure; Discipline. In the event an employee believes he
or she is the subject of sexual harassment shall follow the following
procedure:
      (1)   An employee should report the alleged charge immediately to his/her
immediate supervisor.
      (2)   If the alleged charge involves the employee’s immediate supervisor,
then the employee should immediately report the incident to his/her Department
Head.
      (3)   If the alleged charge involves the employee’s Department Head then
the employee should immediately report the incident to the Administrative
Assistant to the Mayor.
      (4)   Complaints of sexual harassment will be handled confidentially, to
the extent possible, and investigated fully by legal counsel for the Village.
      (5)   Meritorious allegations of sexual harassment will result in severe
disciplinary action against the person or persons responsible therefor, up to
and including termination.
      (6)   Knowingly false accusations will result in severe disciplinary
action against the accuser, up to and including termination.
         (Ord. 2001-5. Passed 3-7-01.)
147.23 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
   (a)   Employees of the Village may participate in any Employee Assistance
Program in which the Village is enrolled, subject to the eligibility rules of
such program.
   (b)   The Mayor may select one or more Employee Assistance Programs to
provide such benefits to the employees, provided that a current appropriation
of sufficient funds has been made to pay for such a program.
(Ord. 2013-12. Passed 7-31-12.)
147.24 WAGE CONTINUATION.
   (a)   Full-time employees who are injured in the course and scope of
employment and who are unable to work as a result of a work related injury will
receive wage continuation for a period immediately following the injury not to
exceed twelve (12) work weeks after the date of the injury, provided that the
employee provides appropriate medical documentation within five (5) days of the
injury that they are physically unable to perform the functions of their job.
   (b)   If a full-time employee is unable to return to work due to a work
related injury after twelve (12) work weeks under paragraph (a), the employee
may use sick leave pursuant to Section
147.12 of the Codified Ordinances of Orange Village or apply for compensation
pursuant to the Chapter 4123 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2014-13. Passed 9-10-14.)
147.25 DISCRETIONARY LEAVE.
   The Mayor may grant leave without pay to any Village employee upon written
application for unpaid leave of absence of up to one (1) year when the employee
has no remaining paid leave.
(Ord. 2016-34. Passed 1-11-17.)

refusal or failure to provide a substance abuse test sample or the providing of
an unsatisfactory substance abuse test result, regardless of the grounds on
which a substance abuse test is sought, shall not be considered time spent in
the service of the Village because an employee shall be deemed medically
unqualified for duty in such cases. An employee requesting a confirming
substance abuse test shall be considered to be doing so on the employee's own
time.
      (Ord. 1997-22. Passed 4-9-97.)
155.02 SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY, PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY AND RULE MAKING
AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Policy. It is the Village's policy to provide safe, dependable and
efficient government services to the public. Village employees are a valuable
and important resource and it is therefore the Village's policy to provide a
healthy, safe, and satisfying working environment for its employees as well as
to staff that working environment only with employees who are fit for duty.
Federal laws and regulations have been adopted which require the Village to
implement a drug, controlled substance, and alcohol screening program for
operators of a commercial motor vehicle and for employees who engage in certain
safety sensitive occupations. Accordingly, a requirement for entering Village
employment, retaining Village employment, or advancing in the administrative
service of the Village into positions to which the abovementioned Federal
regulations apply shall henceforth be that such an employee is fit for duty in
the additional sense that he or she is free of drug dependence, not a user of
nor a trafficker in controlled substances or drugs, and free of alcohol
dependency or use such that his or her normal mental or physical capabilities
are not impaired. In meeting these goals, it is further the Village's policy
to:
      (1)   Assure that covered employees operating a covered vehicle with or
without a commercial driver's license are fit for duty and able to perform
their assigned duties in a safe, productive, healthy, and unimpaired manner.
      (2)   Create a workplace free from the adverse effects of drug, alcohol,
and substance abuse.
      (3)   Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances, among persons
entrusted with covered vehicles or persons employed by the Village by contract
to engage in work involving the operation of a covered vehicle.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure that covered
employees who operate covered vehicles are fit for duty; to eliminate, if
possible, the risk to the Village posed by the use of alcohol, drugs, and
controlled substances by covered employees while operating covered vehicles;
and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol abuse, controlled substance use or
drug abuse.
   It is further the Village's purpose to detect, identify and remove from duty
those covered employees who operate covered vehicles when such employees should
not be operating a covered vehicle because they are not fit for duty. However,
it is not the purpose of this policy to warrant or to guarantee to the public
at large or other employees of the Village who are injured by a covered
employee that the Village has detected or will in every instance detect that a
violation of this policy has occurred before some injurious result occurs, and
it is not the purpose of this policy to create an express or implied warranty
on the part of the Village to the public at large or other employees that all
covered employees are free from alcohol abuse, drug misuse, or controlled
substance use. (Ord. 1997-22. Passed 4-9-97.)
   (c)   Applicability and Scope. All employees holding Commercial Driver's
Licenses are prohibited from performing, and the Village as the employer is
prohibited from using a driver to perform, safety-sensitive functions while
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and/or after a positive drug test
result or an alcohol test result indicating a 0.02 Blood Alcohol Concentration
("BAC"), regardless of whether or not the driver is under the influence of
alcohol or drugs, as defined in Federal, State or Local law. Furthermore, no
driver shall drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle ("CMV") while possessing any
product containing alcohol, regardless of its alcohol content, including
medication, food, or other alcohol-containing products that are not
specifically manifested to be on the vehicle.
   This policy applies to all employees who operate equipment requiring a CDL
and who perform safety-sensitive functions. Only those drivers who have
received full waivers from the CDL requirements are waived from the testing
requirements. This policy shall apply to covered employees when going to or
from work, when going to a work site, when preparing to perform work at a site,
when performing work for the Village, when on a break or at lunch while in the
course of performing work, after concluding the performance of work at a site
but before departing the work site, when returning to the Village facilities
following departure from a work site, and when on Village property regardless
of work status.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
   (d)   Rulemaking Authority. The Mayor or the Mayor's designee is hereby
authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as well as create forms,
documents, and procedures for the implementation of this chapter. Such
activities as are undertaken under authority of this subsection shall be
consistent with this chapter and consistent with the relevant Federal laws and
regulations governing substance abuse testing as the same are applicable to the
Village.
(Ord. 1997-22. Passed 4-9-97.)
155.03 SUBSTANCE FOR WHICH TEST IS TO BE CONDUCTED.
   Tests shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for
alcohol, any controlled substance or drug as said terms are defined herein and
whose misuse or abuse is addressed in this chapter.
(Ord. 1997-22. Passed 4-9-97.)
155.04 GROUNDS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING.
   All covered employees shall be subject to substance abuse testing of either
urine, breath, and/or blood under the following circumstances:
   (a)   Pre-employment or Pre-promotion Testing. All applicants who are
selected for appointment or promotion to a position whose incumbent would be a
covered employee shall be notified by the Administrative Assistant upon that
selection that a test for drug, alcohol and controlled substance use must
precede their appointment or promotion into covered employment. An applicant
who is tentatively selected for appointment or promotion by the appointing
authority and who then refuses, declines, or fails to submit to a drug, alcohol
and controlled substance test upon notice to do so by the Administrative
Assistant shall be deemed to be medically unqualified for covered employment
and shall not be appointed or promoted into covered employment. An applicant,
who is selected for appointment or promotion and is tested for drug, alcohol
and controlled substance use prior to appointment or promotion to covered
employment, must receive a satisfactory test result before beginning employment
in the new position.
   (b)   Reasonable Suspicion Testing. 
      (1)   Covered employees shall be subject to a fitness for duty
evaluation, which shall include appropriate urine, blood, and/or breath testing
when a supervisor has reasonable suspicion that controlled substance use, drug
abuse or alcohol use is adversely affecting a covered employee's performance. A
reasonable suspicion referral for testing shall be made on the basis of
documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the long
or short-term effects of substance abuse. "Reasonable suspicion" means an
apparent state of existing facts, circumstances or information which result
from any inquiry by the supervisor or from a credible source which would induce
a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to reasonably believe the covered
employee is under the influence of or using controlled substances, drugs, or
alcohol. Reasonable suspicion determinations leading to a substance abuse test
shall be made by a covered employee's supervisor who shall be reasonably
trained in the detection of the signs and symptoms of substance abuse or who is
reasonably familiar with the same, and who reasonably concludes that a covered
employee's work, mental faculties, or physical capabilities are presently being
impaired or affected by substance abuse. Examples of reasonable suspicion
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-
the-job behavior for unexplained reasons;
         B.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
         C.   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited
substances;
         D.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.   Fights (to mean physical contact), assault, menacing, stalking,
or threatening behavior, and flagrant disregard or violation of established
safety, security or other operating procedures.
      (2)   Reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a covered
employee's possession of alcohol, particularly unopened containers of alcohol
or possession of alcohol by trained medical personnel for purposes of medical
treatment. Possession of alcohol with observations concerning the employee's
appearance, speech, or abnormal conduct are necessary. Possession of a
controlled substance shall be reasonable suspicion for requiring a controlled
substance test. Possession of drugs shall not be grounds for a reasonable
suspicion test if the covered employee can:
         A.   Satisfactorily explain to his or her supervisor the reasons for
possession of the drug;
         B.   Identify the physician who prescribed the drug for the covered
employee (this information can be verified to the supervisor by the pharmacy
filling the prescription or the prescribing physician); and
         C.   The use of drugs has not affected or impaired the employee's work
performance.
      (3)   The fact a satisfactory explanation is provided shall not negate
reasonable suspicion if the covered employee's mental or physical abilities
appear to be affected or impaired by the drug.
      (4)   Observations leading to a reasonable suspicion substance abuse test
shall be reduced to writing or otherwise preserved within a reasonable time by
the supervisor making the decision to require such a test.
      (5)   Once a covered employee has been notified that a reasonable
suspicion test will be conducted, the test shall take place within two (2)
hours of this notice. If the test is not conducted within two hours, a written
record shall be made stating the reasons the test was not promptly
administered. If the test has not been conducted within eight (8) hours
following the notification, no test shall be administered and a record shall be
made of why the test was not administered with eight (8) hours.
   (c)   Post-Accident Testing. A covered employee (as well as any employee
operating a covered vehicle despite not having a commercial driver's license)
shall be subject to urine, blood or breath testing when a covered vehicle is
involved in a collision or when control over a covered vehicle is unexplainably
(for non-mechanical reasons) lost. By way of illustration, but not limitation,
an unexplained loss of control of a covered vehicle or a collision between a
covered vehicle and a person that results in a fatality or injuries requiring
medical attention; a collision between a covered vehicle and another vehicle or
train resulting in material damage, a collision between a covered vehicle and a
stationary or moving object resulting in material damage shall be grounds for a
post accident substance abuse test.
   Material damage for purposes of this subsection means damage estimated to be
equal to or greater than four hundred dollars ($400.00).
   The determination of whether material damage has occurred shall be made by a
supervisor other than one who was within the covered vehicle when the
triggering event occurred or witnessed that event.
   The filing of criminal or traffic charges as a result of a triggering event
shall not be necessary to require a covered employee or a noncovered employee
operating a covered vehicle to submit to a post accident test. Reasonable
suspicion that the operator of a covered vehicle involved in a triggering event
has used drugs, alcohol or controlled substances is immaterial to the
requirement herein of a post-accident test.
   Post-accident testing shall not be permitted to delay the administration of
necessary medical attention to injured covered employees. Once a covered
employee has been notified that a post-accident test will be conducted, it
shall take place within two (2) hours of this notice. If the test is not
conducted within two (2) hours, a written record shall be made stating the
reasons the test was not promptly administered. If the test has not been
conducted within eight (8) hours following the notification, no test shall be
administered and a record shall be made of why the test was not administered
within eight (8) hours.
   Covered employees or non-covered employees who operate a covered vehicle
that is involved in an accident resulting in material damage or in an
unexplained loss of control and who are so seriously injured that a substance
abuse test cannot be obtained within the requisite two (2) hour period shall
execute a medical consent form allowing an analysis of any adequate substitute
bodily fluids taken within two hours of the triggering event for the purposes
of medical treatment to be used for analysis for the purpose of substance abuse
testing (assuming scientifically reliable results can be obtained). Failure to
grant such consent when fluids capable of analysis exist shall cause the
employee to be deemed medically unqualified for duty such that a substance
abuse test is required before the covered employee may return to work.
   The Village may, but shall not be required to, substitute, accept and rely
upon the result of any blood, urine, or breath test conducted pursuant to
Ohio's implied consent statute as an accurate and reliable substance abuse test
for purposes of this chapter provided the test is an accurate and reliable
means for testing for alcohol, drug and controlled substance abuse.
   A covered employee or a non-covered employee who operates a covered vehicle
involved in an accident, unless injured so seriously that immediate medical
attention is required, must make his or her whereabouts known to his immediate
supervisor for purposes of remaining available for a possible substance abuse
test for the balance of the work day or eight (8) hours after the accident,
whichever is later. A covered employee subject to test hereunder who cannot be
located following an accident for the balance of the work day or for eight (8)
hours after the accident shall be deemed medically unqualified for duty and
shall not be permitted to return to work until he or she submits to a substance
abuse test.
   (d)   Random and Unannounced Testing. Covered employees shall be subjected
to random, unannounced urine, blood and/or breath testing for the purpose of
detecting substance abuse. The process used for selection of a covered employee
(s) to take a substance abuse test shall be determined by the Village,
provided, however, that the selection process must yield a random result so
that no predictable pattern of identifying the covered employee to be tested
will exist, and provided further, that random testing shall be conducted on an
intermittent schedule so that predictable time frames when tests will be
administered cannot be ascertained.
   A covered employee randomly selected for an unannounced substance abuse test
shall immediately proceed to the designated sampling location to provide a test
sample. A covered employee who refuses or fails to travel to the collection
site or who refuses or fails to provide a test sample for substance abuse test
analysis within a reasonable time after being randomly selected for test shall
be deemed medically unqualified for employment and shall be relieved of duty
without pay until a sample is provided. Covered employees selected for testing
who are not at work when selected shall be passed over if they have been tested
within the previous three hundred and sixty-five (365) days, and otherwise
shall be instructed to report testing immediately upon their return to work.
   The number of random unannounced substance abuse tests conducted annually
may be determined in accordance with the rules of any consortium which the
Village has entered into.
   (e)   Return-to-Duty Testing. All covered employees who previously received
an unsatisfactory result on a substance abuse test, including any second or
confirming test if one was conducted, must undergo return-to-duty substance
abuse testing before returning to work and be evaluated, and treated if
necessary, for substance abuse, and be released to duty by a competent medical
practitioner before returning to work. Covered employees who are subject to
return-to-duty testing shall also be subject to six (6) or more random and
unannounced substance abuse tests, to be conducted when the covered employee is
at work, during the first twelve (12) months following his or her re-entry into
employment separate and apart from their exposure to random and unannounced
testing. A successful return-to-duty test for alcohol shall be a result of 0.02
or less. A negative screen for drugs and controlled substances shall be
considered a successful test for return-to-duty purposes.
   (f)   Employee Requested Testing. Any employee who questions the results of
a substance abuse test required or administered pursuant to subsections (a)
through (e) hereof may request that a confirming test in addition to any
initial test be performed. This test may be conducted by the same or a

pay pending disciplinary action;
   (g)   No employee shall report to duty or remain on duty when the employee
uses any controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the instructions
of a physician who has advised the driver that the substance does not adversely
affect the driver's ability to operate a motor vehicle. Employees who are
required to take prescription medication which could affect their fitness for
duty shall notify their immediate supervisor of the medication prescribed and
present proof of possession of a prescription for the same;
   (h)   No employee shall report for duty, remain on duty, or perform a
safety-sensitive function if the employee tests positive for controlled
substances;
   (i)   No employee shall use, possess, distribute or sell illegal drugs or

or while on Village business.
   Any statutorily defined illegal activity by an employee in the
administrative service of the Village or an employee of a contractor of the
Village involving drugs, controlled substances or alcohol, whether during or
outside Village employment, shall be grounds for discipline, up to, and
including termination. All Village property shall be subject to inspection at
any time without notice. Property includes, but is not limited to, Village-
owned vehicles, desks, containers, files and storage lockers.
   An employee who believes that another employee is using drugs or controlled
substances or alcohol in violation of this chapter, in an illegal fashion, or
is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol shall report
the same immediately to his or her supervisor, and those who do not report such
facts and circumstances immediately to their supervisor shall themselves be
subject to discipline for neglect of duty.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.07 EFFECTS OF REFUSAL OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST SAMPLE AND
UNSATISFACTORY SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST RESULT.
   (a)   Any covered employee who is subject to a substance abuse test under
this chapter and who is informed, orally or in writing, to submit to a
substance abuse test shall provide a sample adequate for initial and conforming
substance abuse testing. Samples which are provided in an acceptable fashion
and to an appropriate container at the testing facility, which sample(s) are
then lost, lost by breakage, misplaced, mislabeled, mishandled, or contaminated
by the testing facility or its employees so as to be scientifically unreliable
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a sample.
   (b)   Refusal or failure to provide a sample adequate for initial and
confirming testing within a reasonable time, or the refusal or failure of a
covered employee who is notified to provide a substance abuse test sample to
immediately appear for testing, shall cause the covered employee to be deemed
medically unfit for duty and to be relieved of duty without pay.
   (c)   If a substance abuse test indicates the presence of controlled
substances, drugs, or an impermissible level of alcohol in the covered
employee's system, the employee shall be deemed medically unfit for duty, he or
she shall be relieved of duty, and he or she shall be subject to disciplinary
action.
   (d)   No covered employee shall be permitted to perform safety-sensitive
function or engage in the operation of a vehicle whose operation requires a
CDL:
      (1)   When test results indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater;
      (2)   Within four (4) hours after using alcohol;
      (3)   While using alcohol on the job;
      (4)   During the eight (8) hours following an accident if the covered
employee's involvement has not been discounted as a contributing factor in the
accident or until the covered employee is tested for substance abuse and
achieves a satisfactory result; or
      (5)   If the covered employee refuses to submit to required substance
abuse tests.
   Any covered employee who violates any of these prohibitions shall be removed
from safety sensitive functions until he or she has met the conditions for
returning to a safety sensitive function by providing a satisfactory test. If a
covered employee is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater,
but less than 0.04, or if the covered employee is under the influence of or
impaired by alcohol, as indicated by behavior, speech and performance
indicators of alcohol misuse, and a reasonable suspicion alcohol test result
cannot be obtained, the covered employee shall not perform safety sensitive
functions until the start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty
period but no less than 24 hours following administration of the test.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.08 ALCOHOL MISUSE AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE USE INFORMATION, TRAINING AND
REFERRAL.
   (a)   The Village shall provide educational materials that explain the
requirements of the Rules and the Village's policies and procedures with

these materials is distributed to each covered employee prior to the start of
testing, and to each employee subsequently hired or transferred into a position
covered by the policy.
   (b)   The materials supplied to employees may also include information on
additional Village policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol or
controlled substances, including any consequences for a covered employee found
to have a specified alcohol or controlled substance level, that are based on
the Village's authority independent of the Rules. Any such additional policies
or consequences must be clearly and obviously described as being based on
independent authority.
   (c)   Each covered employee shall be required to sign a statement certifying
that he/she has received a copy of the Village's policy/procedure. The Village
shall maintain the original signed certificate and may provide a copy to the
employee.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.09 CONDITIONS FOR RETURN TO EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING A POSITIVE TEST.
   Covered employees who re-enter the administrative service of the Village or
return to private employment on a project undertaken by the Village following
an unsatisfactory substance abuse test result shall be subject to the
conditions which may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (a)   A release to work statement from an approved treatment specialist;
   (b)   A negative return to duty test for drugs, controlled substances and/or
alcohol;
   (c)   An agreement to periodic testing for one year;
   (d)   A statement of expected work-related behavior; and
   (e)   An agreement to follow specified after care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for further

extend over ninety (90) or more days in a three hundred and sixty-five (365)
consecutive day period and involve activities for which the Federal regulations
require substance abuse testing, private employers who employ persons who
provide safety sensitive functions for the Village, and private employers who
are contractually engaged by the Village to operate vehicles which require the
operator of the vehicle to possess a CDL shall adopt an anti-drug policy which
contains the same provisions as this chapter with respect to prohibited conduct
and substance abuse testing. No contractor's employee who is in violation of
this chapter may be employed on Village property or operate a vehicle whose
operator must possess a CDL on a Village contracted project. Private employers
under contact with the Village which subjects its employees to substance abuse
testing may, at substance abuse testing program, with the test results being
referred to the contractor's management for appropriate personnel action.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.11 GENERAL RULES AND PROHIBITIONS RESPECTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE INVOLVING
VILLAGE PROPERTY OR PREMISES.
   (a)   No employee in the administrative service of the Village shall ingest,
take or use, and employees in the administrative service of the Village shall
be disciplined for ingesting, taking, or using any prescription drug or
controlled substance unless prescribed by a person licensed to practice
medicine.
   (b)   Employees who are required to take prescription medicine which could
affect their fitness for duty shall notify their immediate supervisor of the
medication prescribed and present proof of possession of a prescription for the
same.

administrative service of the Village or an employee of a contractor of the
Village involving drugs, controlled substances or alcohol, whether during or
outside Village employment, shall be grounds for discipline.
   (d)   All Village property shall be subject to inspection at any time
without notice. Property includes, but is not limited to, Village-owned
vehicles, desks, containers, files and storage lockers.
   (e)   An employee who believes that another employee is using drugs or
controlled substances or alcohol in violation of this chapter, in an illegal
fashion, or is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol
shall report the same immediately to his or her supervisor and those who do not
report such facts and circumstances immediately to their supervisor shall
themselves be subject to, discipline for neglect of duty.
   (f)   Refusal of a covered employee to take a drug test provided for by this
chapter shall result in immediate suspension from Village service without pay
pending disciplinary action.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.12 SATISFACTORY SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST RESULT.
   A satisfactory result shall be considered to be a negative drug and/or
substance abuse test, whether such test be initial or conforming. A
satisfactory alcohol test shall be considered to be a breath alcohol level of
0.02 or less. A breath alcohol test which is 0.04 or less shall not be
disqualifying if the applicant, at a time randomly selected within the next
seventy-two (72) hours, provides a satisfactory breath test of 0.02 or less on
an identical test device. An unsatisfactory result shall be considered a test
result other than as described above or an inexcusable failure or refusal to
provide a substance abuse test sample. An employee or an applicant for
employment may present a current prescription for a drug as justification for
any positive drug test result and be considered to have obtained a satisfactory
result, provided the dosage prescribed is not deemed to be of such a nature as
to impair the applicant's faculties if taken as prescribed.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.13 REFERRAL, EVALUATION AND TREATMENT.
   (a)   Covered employees who test positive for drugs or for alcohol at 0.04
or above (or who refuse to take a drug or alcohol test) shall be evaluated by a
Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP will determine what assistance, if
any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol or drug
abuse. Covered employees shall be required to participate in and successfully
complete any treatment recommendations by the SAP. The SAP may direct the
employee to undergo unannounced, follow-up drug and/or alcohol testing
following the employee's return to duty.
   (b)   Covered employees must take and successfully pass a Return to Duty
drug and/or alcohol test before they may return to work. For purposes of this
subpart, successfully passing a return to duty test means a test result lower
than 0.02.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.14 RECORD RETENTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.
   Drug and alcohol test results are confidential. The Village will not release
employee drug and alcohol test results unless required or permitted by law or
the CDL employee authorizes the release in writing. (Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-
10.)
155.15 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Administrative Assistant to the Mayor is designated by the Village as
the Alcohol/Drug Designated Employer Representative (DER). The DER is
responsible for answering questions from employees or the public in general.

and alcohol testing.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.16 SEVERABILITY.

unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and
effect.
(Ord. 2010-27. Passed 12-8-10.)
155.17 FUTURE DOT GUIDELINES.

TITLE NINE - Judiciary
Chap.
191. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 191
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Orange has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an
Orange ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Orange, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04.
In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws
pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R. C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is
charged with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the
charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be
tried before him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Bedford Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he demands a jury trial. But the
jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of
the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his right to jury trial
in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his compensation as a judge is
not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the
chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such
responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R. C. 2938. 04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later.
   Failure to claim a jury trial as provided herein is a complete waiver of the
right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04 provides, further, that a jury trial may not
be had in courts not of record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where
the right to a jury trial may be asserted shall require the magistrate to
certify such case to a court of record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Orange ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed
a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas”, the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.

such schedule is posted in the Orange Village Police Department Secretary’s

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable. The

search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of any
traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this Traffic
Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

313.07 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   (b)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public

313.09 DRIVER'S DUTIES UPON APPROACHING AMBIGUOUS OR NON-WORKING TRAFFIC
SIGNAL.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right of way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle.
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right of way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an

331.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.25)
331.02 PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in

turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the
roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that
portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such
vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as
to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane of
the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in that
lane.

in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency

violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court

      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;

         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the
   defendant or the defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person
who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time
limit in the interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of
thirty consecutive days. The court shall impose the thirty-day mandatory jail
term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this
section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the
vehicle as determined by publications of the national auto dealers association.

that results in the death of another or the unlawful termination of another’s
pregnancy may result in the person being guilty of aggravated vehicular
homicide under Ohio R.C. 2903.06. The court may warn the person of the
applicable penalties for that violation under Ohio R.C. 2903.06 and 2929.142.

Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has
safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any
recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
loadreceiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a loadreceiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of highway vehicles;
or a sealed scale. adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded.
The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a municipal, County or State sealer with
the State standards or standards approved by the State and such scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   (b)   At each end of a permanently installed scale there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   (c)   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level
or, if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (d)   In the determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (e)   Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that
the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
is necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Sections
339.01,

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

(ORC 2901.11)

      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
 
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.

from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which

purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.

(Ord. 1990-11. Passed 2-14-90.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $ 5000.00

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

defining the offense.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by Ohio
R.C. 4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

by the person receiving the tax to the Tax Administrator in monthly
installments. Remittances therefor shall be made on or before the thirtieth day
of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received.
   (d)   Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless another method of payment or remittance is required by the
Administrator, but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the
tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Administrator
unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount.
   (e)   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a
return upon such forms and shall set forth such information as the
Administrator may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for
which he or she is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and
transmit the same to the Administrator with a remittance for the amount. The
Administrator may, at his or her discretion, require verified annual returns
from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such additional
information as he or she may believe necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show,
exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is
subject to such tax and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of
which the Administrator shall be the judge, the Administrator may require the
report and remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of
the tax, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, at the conclusion
of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such other time as the
Administrator determines. Failure to comply with any requirement of the
Administrator with reference to the report and remittance of such tax shall be
a violation of this chapter.
   (f)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting such tax
shall be, with reference to admission charges and tax collections, at all
reasonable times, subject to examination and audit by the Administrator. If the
tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added, as part
of the tax, interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time
the tax became due until the tax is paid.
(Ord. 1962-30. Passed 12-5-62.)
771.05 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION; FEE; POSTING.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for which an admission charge
is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, make application
to and procure from the Mayor a certificate of registration, the fee for which
shall be one dollar ($1.00). Such certificate shall continue valid until
December 31 of the year in which it is issued. Such certificate, or copies
thereof to be issued by the Administrator without additional charge, shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of
admission are sold.
(Ord. 1962-30. Passed 12-5-62. )
771.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted, as provided in Section
771.04, by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application the name and address of the owner, lessee or
custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted, and such
owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Tax Administrator of the
issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for the collection and
remittance of the tax.
(Ord. 1962-30. Passed 12-5-62.)
771.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Mayor shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the payment,
collection and remittance of the tax imposed by this chapter. A copy of the
rules and regulations shall be published in the same manner as ordinances of
the Municipality are published before they become effective. Copies of such
rules and regulations shall be made available in the office of the Tax
Administrator. The failure or refusal of any person to comply with any such
rule or regulation shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (b)   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated under the
authority of this section, the rules and regulations of the State Department of
Taxation relating to admissions taxes in effect on August 31, 1947, except as
they may conflict with this chapter, shall be deemed to be the rules and
regulations referred to in this section.
(Ord. 1962-30. Passed 12-5-62.)
771.08 APPEALS TO COUNCIL.

property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in

or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,

taxable by the municipal corporation under Ohio R.C. 718.011;

If the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an equitable result,
another basis may be substituted, under uniform regulations adopted by the
Administrator, so as to produce an equitable result.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.
   (c)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
municipal corporation and, except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 718.01, a
municipal corporation may impose a tax on all income earned by residents of the

      (2)   Where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant

if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or

owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes, interest

successor fails to withhold such amount, then the successor and, in a personal
manner, the successor's manager, shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of such taxes, interest and penalty.
(Ord. 1988-60. Passed 11-9-88.)
775.17 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer in or doing business in the Municipality shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation, the tax rate imposed in Section
775.03 as a percentage of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation due by the employer to each employee, and shall, on or before the
last day of each month, make a return and pay to the Administrator the amount
of the tax so deducted during the previous month. However, if the amount of the
tax so deducted by the employer in any one month is less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the employer may defer the filing of a return and the
payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the month following the
end of the calendar quarter in which such month occurred.
   (b)   The returns shall be made on a form prescribed by, or acceptable to,
the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator. The employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such tax has, in
fact, been withheld.
   (c)   The employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee for
the benefit of the Municipality. Any such tax collected by such employer from
his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality, be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation paid to domestic servants employed by him or
her exclusively in or about his or her residence, even though such residence is
in the Municipality, but such servants shall be subject to all of the
requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Manager's Obligation.
      (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Every
manager is liable directly to this Municipality for payment of such trust
funds, whether actually collected by such employer or not. Any tax deducted and
withheld is to be considered paid to this Municipality, whether or not the
employer actually remits the tax to this Municipality, for purposes of
determining employee payments or credits only.
      (2)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under
this chapter.
      (3)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees' or manager's
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.
   (f)   Occasional Entrants. 
      (1)   Occasional entrants shall not be subject to the Village municipal
income tax for the 12 or fewer days they work in the Village. For purposes of
the 12- day calculation, any portion of a day worked in the Village shall be
counted as one day worked in the Village.
      (2)   Beginning with the thirteenth day, the employer of any individual
shall begin withholding the Village income tax from remuneration paid by the
employer to the individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the
Village in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. Since the
individual will no longer be considered an occasional entrant, the employer is,
further, required to remit taxes on income earned in the Village for the first
twelve days.
      (3)   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the responsibility
of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the Village.

the same or a higher rate of tax in another municipality. If the estimated tax

provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
776.12 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
776.12 (A).
           (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
           (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within Municipality
from a stock of goods located within Municipality.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within Municipality from a
location outside Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within Municipality to
purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in Municipality.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to Municipality.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to
Municipality.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Municipality based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Municipality.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Municipality.
Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of Municipality shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Municipality. The individual may claim a credit for taxes

      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   Left intentionally blank.
      (9)   Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   “Qualifying remote employee or owner” means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   “Qualifying remote work location” means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
“Qualifying remote work location” may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   “Reporting location” means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
776.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   “Qualifying reporting location” means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee’s or owner’s supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee’s or owner’s
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer’s business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division, in
writing on or with the taxpayer’s net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax
Administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee’s or owner’s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual’s qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual’s qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualfying wages
pursuant to Section
776.04 of this Chapter.

776.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Municipality. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
776.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
 776.01 of this Chapter, of two percent (2.0%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
       (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required to
make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Municipality. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Municipality as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Municipal Income Tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
           (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Municipal income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Municipality until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
           (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
           (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
           (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
          (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

section, an employer is not required to withhold Municipal Income Tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Municipality if the employee performed such services in Municipality on 20
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in
Municipality.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Municipality at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than twenty (20) days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20) days" if either of the
following applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty (20) days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
 776.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Municipality than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Municipality exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to Municipality for any subsequent days
in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in Municipality.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Municipality
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
Municipality for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in
Municipality.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Municipality and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
 776.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
776.04. (Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Municipal income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
 776.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due Municipality.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Municipal income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to

the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
        (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
       (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each individual
income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be completed
and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed
for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of
Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality's income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023,
the extended due date of Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of aa
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a Tax Administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
filed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
 
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Municipality shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
776.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
776.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by Municipality to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Municipality, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by
Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this Chapter and any other Municipal ordinances, resolutions, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file a Municipal
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
        (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
       (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Municipality
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Municipality during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th)
day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall
provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred eighty-first
(181st) day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing

   Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Municipal
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Municipal income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
776.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
       (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
776.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
       (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
776.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
776.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
776.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Municipality;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
 776.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Municipality in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

776.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Municipality who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/ordinance, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter/ordinance
upon satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.
Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed sixty
percent (60%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR

   (B)   Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 776.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Municipality under Section
776.05 for that year.

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
       (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
776.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Municipality, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Municipality as a
refund but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Municipality is subject to recovery by Municipality.
If Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed
for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality,
Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding
Municipality claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the
tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (C)   If Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Municipality's tax rate. However, if Municipality's tax rate is greater than
the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to Municipality, along with any penalty and
interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
776.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Municipality. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
 776.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipality's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject
to Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state
tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Municipal income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten ($10.00) dollars.
(Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.12 LIMITATIONS.

later of:
            (i)   Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
776.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
 776.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Municipality does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
776.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
776.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-24.
Passed 10-14-15.)
776.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipal official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
       (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty (20%) percent, as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Municipality that arises pursuant to Municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality:
       (1)   Compromise a claim;
       (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2014-25. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Municipality as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2014-25. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Municipal ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Municipality or the Tax Administrator.

         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Municipality on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

776.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
        (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

 776.99.
      (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
776.19 within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
776.18.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
776.99 for a violation of Section
776.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

subject to appeal. (Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)

        (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person

otherwise.

rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section

Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC. (Ord. 2015-24. Passed 10-14-15.)
776.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of Municipality,
or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the administrator by

781.01 LEVY OF TAX; RATE.
   There is hereby levied and imposed on every person who is a transient guest
in a hotel and pays a charge for lodging therein a tax of three percent (3%) on
the amount paid for such lodging, irrespective of whether such lodging is paid
by cash or credit card. The tax shall apply to every hotel in the Village for
which a charge for lodging is made, notwithstanding the fact that a reservation
for lodging is made outside the Village.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, certain terms and words are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Excise tax" means the tax imposed by the Village on transactions by
which hotel lodgings shall be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   "Hotel" means an establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised or
held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered
to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation of such
guests, whether such rooms are in one or more structures.
   (c)   "Person" means an individual, receiver, assignee, trustee in
bankruptcy, estate, firm, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint
venture, club, society, corporation, the State and its political subdivisions
and any combination of individuals.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
   (d)   “Transient Guest” means a person who meets the definition of transient
under Sections
1140.05(21) and (25) of the Orange Village Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2004-28. Passed 10-13-04.)
781.03 COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE OF TAX; INTEREST.
   (a)   Any person receiving a payment on which a tax is imposed by this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
lodging payment. Such tax shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person
required to collect the same until paid to the Village as provided in this
section. Any person required to collect such tax who fails to collect the same,
or, having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Village in the
manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his or
her own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his or her control,
shall nevertheless be personally liable to the Village for the amount of such
tax and shall, unless the remittance is made as required in this section, be
guilty of a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1981-54. Passed 11-11-81.)
   (b)   Such tax shall be collected at the time a lodging charge is paid by a
transient guest and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the
tax to the Tax Administrator in monthly installments. Remittances therefor
shall be made on or before the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the
end of the monthly period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or
remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless payment or
remittance is otherwise required by the Tax Administrator, but payment by check
shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for payment and
remittance of the tax to the Administrator, unless the check is honored and is
in the full and correct amount.
(Ord. 1999-16. Passed 4-14-99.)
   (c)   The person receiving payment for lodging from transient guests shall
make out a return on such forms and set forth such information as the
Administrator may require, showing the amount of tax on the lodgings for which
such person is liable for the preceding quarterly period, and shall sign the
same, have it verified by a certified public accountant and transmit the same
to the Administrator with a remittance for such amount, provided that the
Administrator may, at his or her discretion, require verified annual returns
from any person receiving lodging payments setting forth such additional
information as the Administrator may deem necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable. The failure to comply with any requirement
of the Administrator as to the report and remittance of the tax is a violation
of this chapter.
   (d)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting such tax
shall, as to lodging and tax collection, be at all reasonable times subject to
examination and audit by the Administrator or his or her agent. If such tax is
not paid when due, there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 1981-54. Passed 11-11-81.)
781.04 CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION; FEE.

to and procure from the Administrator, a certificate of registration, the fee
for which shall be one dollar ($1.00), which certificate shall continue valid
until December 31 of the year in which the same was issued. Such certificate,
or copies thereof to be issued by the Administrator without additional charge,
shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each office where sleeping
accommodations are assigned.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.05 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
the payment, collection and remittance of the tax imposed by this chapter. A
copy of such rules and regulations shall be reported to Council and posted at
the Village Hall for two weeks before they become effective, and copies shall
be printed and made available to the public. The failure or refusal to comply
with any such rule or regulation shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (b)   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated pursuant to
this section, the rules and regulations of the State Department of Taxation
relating to excise taxes in effect, except as the same may conflict with this
chapter, shall be deemed to be the rules and regulations hereunder.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.06 APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Tax Administrator under this chapter shall be
made to Council in the same manner as other appeals to Council. Council shall
have the authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling appealed from, in
conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.07 CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION.
   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into the possession of
the Tax Administrator or his or her agents and employees shall be held
confidential. No person shall make a disclosure thereof unless ordered by a
court of competent jurisdiction, provided, however, that the Administrator may
furnish the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department of the United
States, with copies of such returns.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.08 VIOLATIONS.
   No person charged by this chapter with the duty of collecting or remitting
the excise tax on lodgings shall willfully fail or refuse to charge, collect or
pay such tax, or to make a return to the Tax Administrator as required by this
chapter, or to permit the Administrator or his or her duly authorized agent to
examine such person's books, records and accounts, in or on any premises where
the same are kept, to the extent necessary to verify any return made or to
ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if no return was made, or
to maintain and keep such books, records and accounts for three years or such
lesser or greater time as may be permitted or required by the Administrator.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.09 SEPARABILITY.
   Sections
781.01 through
781.08 and each part of such sections are hereby declared to be independent
sections or parts of sections and notwithstanding any other evidence of
legislative intent it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative
intent that if any provision of such sections, or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or
parts of sections, and the application of such provision to any person or
circumstance other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that this chapter would have been
passed independently of such section, sections or parts of a section so held to
be invalid.
(Ord. 1979-61. Passed 2-13-80.)
781.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter for which no penalty is otherwise provided is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars

separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a

901.09 WAIVER OF PERMIT PROCESS FOR SINGLE RESIDENTIAL UTILITY OR
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   In the event that a utility connection for a single residence is to be
made in the Village right of way, the person performing the work may obtain a
waiver or a partial waiver from the requirements of this Chapter by submitting
to the Building Department a plan noting the location of the proposed
connection and adjacent facilities in the right of way ( e.g., location of
road, location of utility poles in vicinity, etc.). In the event the Village
Engineer determines that a waiver or a partial waiver of the requirements of
this Chapter is appropriate, because there are no facilities in the right of
way which are likely to be adversely impacted by the proposed utility
connection, the Village Engineer shall grant the requested waiver or partial
waiver and may establish terms and conditions which must be met by the person
so that public or private property is adequately protected or restored. The
Village Engineer shall establish a form which permits for such waiver or
partial waiver and states the conditions (e.g., pavement and lawn restoration
requirements) upon which the waiver is granted. A failure to comply with the
conditions of the waiver is a violation of this section.
   (b)    For a telecommunications service connection that is predominantly
located on private property, the telecommunications service provider shall
provide not less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice to the Building Department
that the work will be performed and shall show the approximate location of the
work to be performed. The Building Department shall supply forms for
telecommunications providers that provide space for the required information.
For the purposes of this section, a "Telecommunication service connection"
means technology and facilities which enable information to be exchanged

expenses incurred in connection with the applicant’s business before the
Planning and Zoning Commission or Council. Should an applicant’s special fund
have a balance of less than twenty percent (20%) of the original deposit, the
Mayor shall request in writing that the applicant provide an additional deposit
so that the balance shall then equal the original deposit required. In the
event such request is approved or disapproved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or Council, or withdrawn by the applicant, any funds remaining in
such special deposit account, after payment of all lawful charges thereupon,
shall immediately be returned to the applicant. The Treasurer shall furnish an
accounting of charges to such fund at any reasonable time upon request of the
applicant and upon final dispersal.

expenses, as required by this chapter, the Planning and Zoning Commission or
Council may dismiss any application unaccompanied by the required deposit.
   (b)   Nothing herein shall obligate the Village to grant its approval of an
application or be construed as consideration therefore, but rather the deposit
shall serve the purpose that the Village shall continue to be governed by its
officials’ informed and intelligent vote upon each specific appeal and with the
direction that such funds are to be applied to furnish the Village with
necessary technical data from professional municipal consultants when requested
or required by it on specific applications or to defray other necessary
administrative expenses regardless of the outcome of the final disposition of
the request or proposal of the applicant.

upon property by deed, covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive
covenants running with the land to which the Village is a party. Where these

1123.01 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   (a)   Prior to the submission of a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall
seek the assistance of the Planning and Zoning Commission and municipal
officials with regard to development of the proposed property. The purpose of
the pre-application review is to make the subdivider familiar with the
requirements of these subdivision regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan
for Orange Village as it affects the proposed subdivision location.
   (b)   The subdivider shall submit to the Building Commissioner a preliminary
sketch plan indicating the general approach to developing the site, including
the approaches to storm water management, utility service, access, and traffic
flow. The Building Commissioner will forward the sketch plan to the Village
Engineer, and other administrative officials, as appropriate, for review and

Zoning Commission agenda for general discussion and comment. The applicant and
the applicant’s engineer shall attend the pre-application review meeting with
the Planning and Zoning Commission. (Ord. 2008-33. Passed 5-13-09.)
1123.02 SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   (a)   Submission. The subdivider shall prepare and submit an application for
approval of a preliminary plat. Said application shall be submitted to the
Building Commissioner at least ten (10) working days prior to a regularly
scheduled Council meeting. All applications for preliminary plat approval shall
include:
      (1)   A completed application form.
      (2)   Six (6) copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
as required in Section
1125.02.
      (3)   A plat review fee and deposits as established by Village Council,
and
      (4)   A letter describing any requested waivers to the standard
provisions of these subdivision regulations and the justification therefor.
   No preliminary plat shall be considered officially filed until it has been
examined by the Building Commissioner and is found to contain all of the
required information as set forth in this Section and in Section
1125.02.
   (b)   Transmittal and Review. Upon receipt of an application as set forth in
Section
1123.02(a) hereof, the Building Commissioner shall transmit copies of the
proposed preliminary subdivision plat to the appropriate Village, County, and
other officials and agencies for review and comment. The Building Commissioner
shall forward a copy to the Law Director who shall prepare an ordinance
approving the preliminary plat for first reading at the next regularly
scheduled Council meeting provided that the complete application was received
by the Building Commissioner at least ten (10) working days prior to the next
Council meeting. If the application is received less than ten (10) working days
prior to the next Council meeting, the ordinance approving the preliminary plat
shall be read on first reading at the regular meeting of Council immediately
following the next regular meeting. The ordinance prepared by the Law
Department shall refer the preliminary plat to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for report and recommendation.
   (c)   Commission Action. The Commission shall act on the preliminary plat
within sixty (60) days from the date the preliminary plat ordinance is
officially referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission or within such time
frame as the Commission, at the request of the applicant and for good cause
shown, may establish provided that such time frame may not exceed ninety (90)
days from the date of referral. If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to
act within ninety (90) days from the date the preliminary plat ordinance is
officially referred to the Commission, the Commission, consistent with
Article III, Section 12 of the Charter, shall be deemed to have approved the
preliminary plat.
   After receipt of reports from such officials and agencies, the Commission
shall determine whether to recommend to the Village Council the approval of the
preliminary plat as submitted, approval with modifications, conditional
approval, or disapproval. Consistent with
Article III, Section 12 of the Charter, disapproval of a preliminary plat by
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall require a vote of five (5) members of
Council for adoption or authorization.
   If a preliminary development plan is also required pursuant to Chapter
1143, a preliminary plat shall not be approved until the preliminary
development plan is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
Planning and Zoning Commission, however, may concurrently recommend approval of
the preliminary plat and approval of the preliminary development plan.
   (d)   Notice of Recommendation and Action of Council. Notice of the Planning
and Zoning Commission’s recommendation shall be supplied to the subdivider and
the preliminary plat shall be forwarded to the Village Council for approval as
submitted, approval with modifications, conditional approval, or disapproval.
The action of the Village Council shall be noted on two (2) copies of the
preliminary plat and the application form and one (1) copy of each returned to
the subdivider. One copy of each shall be retained on file by the Building
Commissioner.
   (e)   Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat by the Village
Council shall not constitute approval of the final plat of the subdivision by
the Village Council and does not constitute authorization to record the
subdivision. Preliminary plat approval shall be effective for a period of one
(1) year from the date of approval unless an extension of time is granted, for
good cause shown, by the Village Council. The general terms and conditions
under which the preliminary approval was granted will not be affected by any
changes and/or amendments to these Regulations during the one (1) year time
period following approval or such extension of time that the Village Council
may grant. Upon expiration of a preliminary plat approval, no approval of a
final plat shall be given until the preliminary plat has been resubmitted and
approved.

examined by the Building Commissioner and found to be in full compliance with
the provisions of this Section and Section
1125.03.
   (b)   Submission Limitations.
      (1)   All final plats shall be subsequent to and substantially in
conformance with a previously approved preliminary plat and shall have
incorporated all changes or modifications required by the Village Council. The
final plat shall be filed not later than twelve (12) months after the date of
approval of the preliminary plat or within such time limits established at the
time the preliminary plat was approved; otherwise, it will be considered void
unless an extension was previously granted by the Village Council.
      (2)   Final plats may constitute only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the
time. Subdivisions may be submitted for final approval in consecutive sections
provided that a preliminary plat has been approved for the entire subdivision
and that improvement plans for any section include all improvements determined
by the Village Engineer as required to support said section even when said
improvements are located beyond the limits of the section.
   (c)   Transmittal and Review. Upon receipt of an application for final plat
approval, the Building Commissioner shall transmit copies of the proposed
subdivision plat to the appropriate Village, County, and other officials and
agencies for review and comment. The Building Commissioner shall forward a copy
to the Law Director who shall prepare an ordinance approving the final plat for
first reading at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting provided that a
complete final plat application was received by the Building Commissioner at
least ten (10) working days prior to the next Council meeting. If the
application is received less than ten (10) working days prior to the next
Council meeting, the ordinance approving the preliminary plat shall be read on
first reading at the regular meeting of Council immediately following the next
regular meeting. The ordinance prepared by the Law Director shall refer the
final plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission for report and recommendation.
   (d)   Planning and Zoning Commission Action. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall take action on the final plat within sixty (60) days from the
date the final plat ordinance is officially referred to the Planning and Zoning
Commission or within such time frame as the Commission, at the request of the
applicant and for good cause shown, may establish provided that such time frame
may not exceed ninety (90) days from the date of referral. If the Planning and
Zoning Commission fails to act within ninety (90) days from the date the final
plat ordinance is officially referred to the Commission, the Commission,
consistent with
Article III, Section 12 of the Charter, shall be deemed to have approved the
final plat.
   The Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove said plat.
If disapproved, the grounds for disapproval of the final plat shall be stated
on the record of the Commission, including the reference to the regulation
violated by the plat, and a copy of said record of the Commission shall be
forwarded to the subdivider. The subdivider shall have forty- five (45) days or
such time limit as may be established by the Commission to make any necessary
corrections and resubmit the final plat to the Commission for approval. If the
final plat and construction plans are acceptable, the subdivider shall be
notified of the approval or conditional approval of the plat by the Commission.
Said approval or conditional approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall constitute a recommendation of approval to the Village Council and the
Commission Secretary shall forward such recommendation to the Clerk of Council.
If the subdivider does not resubmit the corrected final plat within forty-five
(45) days or such time limit as may be established by the Commission, the
Commission Secretary shall forward a recommendation of disapproval to the Clerk
of Council.
   (e)   Final Plat Approval. Upon receipt of the recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the Clerk of Council shall schedule the final
plat for presentation to the Village Council for final approval and
authorization for recording. Such approval shall not constitute acceptance or
final approval of the improvements required to be installed by the subdivider.
Consistent with
Article III, Section 12 of the Charter, disapproval of a final plat by the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall require a vote of five (5) members of
Council for adoption or authorization.
   (f)   Recording of Final Plat. The Village, upon final plat approval by the
Village Council and receipt of a performance guarantee acceptable to the
Village Engineer, the Village Building Commissioner, and the Village Law
Director, shall cause the approved final plat to be recorded in the office of
the County Recorder. The costs incurred in filing the plat are the
responsibility of the developer. Once the final plat is recorded, the
subdivider may apply for building permits in compliance with all applicable
regulations and procedures. Occupancy permits for any building, however, shall
not be issued until the streets are accepted by the Village for public use in
accordance with Section

(for example, final paving course, sidewalks, street trees, etc.) have not been
completed provided a performance guarantee, in addition to the maintenance bond
required by this Section, acceptable to the Village Engineer, the Village Law
Director, and the Building Commissioner has been provided to assure completion
of the requisite improvements.

including land for public use to the Law Director who shall prepare an
ordinance accepting the public area improvements for maintenance for first
reading at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting provided that all
necessary documents were submitted to the Building Commissioner at least ten

Zoning Commission.
      (4)   After receipt of reports and recommendations from Village officials
and agencies, the Commission shall determine whether to recommend acceptance of
the dedicated public areas and improvements for maintenance. Consistent with
Article III, Section 12 of the Charter, disapproval of an ordinance accepting
improvements for maintenance by the Planning and Zoning Commission requires a
vote of five (5) members of Council for adoption or authorization.

of buildings and other structures hereafter erected or altered; the bulk and

1142.05 REZONING AND VARIANCE FEES; DEPOSITS.
   When filing an application for rezoning and/or a variance, the applicant
shall pay to the Treasurer the fee set forth in the schedule established by
Council pursuant to Section

to the Village of processing the variance request exceed the amount deposited,
an invoice shall be submitted to the applicant for payment of the
difference. (Ord. 2016-12. Passed 6-1-16.)
1142.06 ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS; RULES AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Authority. Pursuant to Article III, Section 9(C) of the Orange
Village Charter, Council may grant variances, special use permits and make
findings declaring that uses are similar, harmonious and compatible with other
permitted uses in the Planning and Zoning Code, after public hearing, where
there are practical difficulties or substantial and unreasonable hardship in
carrying out the spirit and intent of the Code, and in order to protect the
general purposes of the Zoning Code so the public health, safety and general
welfare may be secured and substantial justice done.
   (b)    Procedure. The procedures for considering a variance or other
administrative relief to the zoning code, shall be as follows:
      (1)    Upon the filing of an application with the Building Department,
which must be accompanied by the appropriate fees and deposits required under
Chapter
1327 of the Building Code, the Building Department shall:
         A.   Place the request for administrative relief on the agenda for the
next Planning and Zoning Commission meeting next occurring no less than
fourteen (14) days after receipt of the application, fees and deposits.
         B.   No later than ten (10) days before the Planning and Zoning
Commission meeting at which the matter is to be first considered, the Secretary
of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall mail notice of the variance request
to the neighbors of the applicant. For purposes of this section, "neighbors"
means the owners of property abutting or directly across the street from the
property that is the subject of the request for administrative relief. The
addresses of such owners shall be obtained from the addresses appearing on the
Cuyahoga County GIS, currently known as "Cuyahoga County, Ohio MyPlace". The
failure to mail notices to owners whose names do not appear on such lists, as
well as the failure of delivery of such notice, shall not invalidate any
variance granted hereunder. The mailed notification shall set forth the time
and place of the first Planning and Zoning Commission meeting where the matter
will be on the agenda and a summary description of the requested administrative
relief.
      (2)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall take evidence and sworn
testimony from proponents and opponents (if any) of the requested
administrative action and shall recommend to Council an appropriate disposition
of the action. The Commission shall allow the cross-examination of all
witnesses and shall allow all proponents and opponents (if any) to present
their cases in full. The Planning and Zoning Commission meeting shall be
recorded, and the recording of the meeting may be transcribed by a professional
court reporter at the request of any party and such transcription shall be the
official transcript of the hearing.
      (3)    After the Planning and Zoning Commission makes its recommendation
to the Village Council, the Clerk of Council shall schedule a public hearing
regarding the requested administrative relief. Notice of the hearing shall be
given by the Clerk by publication on the Village's website of the date and time
of the public hearing, which notice shall be posted not less than seven (7)
days prior to the hearing.
      (4)    The Law Director shall submit a draft of a Final Order and
Decision of Council with Conclusions of Fact ("Final Order") to the Village
Council not later then five (5) days prior to the public hearing. The draft
Final Order shall be based upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Given the possibility of litigation on any request for
administrative action, the Final Order shall be subject to the attorney-client
privilege and shall not be a public record until Council votes on the document.
      (5)    Council shall hold a public hearing, where any interested party
may speak for or against the proposed administrative relief. The record of the
matter shall consist of the evidence and testimony submitted to the Planning &
Zoning Commission and the arguments presented to Council. After the public
hearing the Village Council may take any of the following actions:
A.   Vote on the Final Order as recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
         B.   Remand the matter to the Planning and Zoning Commission so it may
reconsider its recommendation upon such further evidence and testimony that may
be submitted. The Commission shall follow the same procedure as is required for
the initial hearing of the matter.
         C.   Meet with the Law Director in executive session to discuss
prospective litigation so that revisions to the Final Order may be considered
in a manner which preserves the attorney-client privilege.
      (6)    Any recommendation by Planning and Zoning Commission to disapprove
the requested administrative relief shall require a vote of five (5) members of
Council for approval.
   (c)    Standard of Review: Variance. A variance may be granted where the
literal application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in
practical difficulties or hardship in the reasonable use of a property, and
such difficulties or hardship are not necessary to advance any purpose of this
zoning code. Such difficulties should be peculiar to the property in question,
making it distinct from the general difficulties of other properties in the
district, provided that all similarly situated properties shall be treated the
same. Factors to be considered and weighed in determining whether a property
owner seeking a variance has encountered such practical difficulties or an
unnecessary hardship in the use of the subject property may include, but are
not limited to:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)    Whether the variance is a substantial deviance from the use or
area requirements;
      (3)    Whether the character of a particular neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
government services, including, but not limited to, water, sewer, and garbage;
      (5)    Whether the property was purchased with knowledge of the zoning
restriction;
      (6)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (7)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance;
      (8)    Whether other exceptional circumstances or conditions, which are
applicable only to the property involved or to the intended use or development
of the property do not apply to other property within the same zoning district,
or whether there are circumstances justifying a variance on one lot, and that a
variance would be justified on any lot where the same set of circumstances
exist.
   (d)    Standard of Review: Similar Use. If a Chapter of the Zoning Code
provides a standard for approving a use that is similar to a permitted use in
that Chapter, that standard shall be applied. If a proposed use of a property
does not fit one of the definitions of a permitted use within a zoning
district, the use may be determined to be a Similar Use if it is harmonious and
compatible with the other uses in the district and consistent with the purpose
and intent of the district and will not, when appropriate conditions are
imposed by the Council and adhered to by the property owner, adversely impact
neighboring properties. Council may revoke a Similar Use permit, upon the
complaint of the Building Commissioner, if it finds that the conditions that
were imposed upon the property as a condition of permitting the Similar Use
have not been met by the property owner.
   (e)    Expiration of Approval. If, after the expiration of one (1) year from
the date when
Council has approved the requested relief, no substantial work has been
performed in accordance with the terms and conditions for which such approval
was granted, the Building Commissioner shall give a written notice to the
property owner that the approval will expire in thirty (30) days. The notice
from the Building Commissioner shall also advise the owner of the right to
request an extension of the approval by filing a request for such extension
with the Building Commissioner. If the property owner or the owner's
representative files a written request for an extension of the approval with
the Building Commissioner, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider
the request and may grant an extension for up to one additional year. Only one
extension may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. After the
expiration of the approval (including any extension thereof), the approval
shall be deemed null and void, and all regulations governing the subject
property shall be in effect as if no approval had ever been granted. The
Building Commissioner shall advise the Clerk of Council of the expiration of
the approval, and the Clerk shall enter such expiration upon the Council's
records.
   (f)    Effect of Denial. In the event a request for administrative relief is
denied, neither the Planning and Zoning Commission nor Council shall consider a
request for the same, or a substantively similar variance, unless the applicant
can first show that the underlying conditions which relate to the request have
substantially changed since the prior request for a variance was denied. The
determination of whether a request for administrative relief is substantively
similar to a prior request shall be made by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and its decision shall be final.
(Ord. 2018-50. Passed 2-6-19.)
1142.07 EXPIRATION OF APPROVAL.
   If, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date when the Planning and
Zoning Commission has granted any approval, no substantial work is done in
accordance with the terms and conditions for which such approval was granted,
or if the building permit for such work is expired and cannot be
administratively renewed by the Building Commissioner pursuant to Section
1325.06 of the Orange Village Codified Ordinances, the approval granted by the
Commission shall expire. If the property owner or the owner’s representative
files a written request for an extension of the approval with the Building
Commissioner not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
approval, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the request and may
grant an extension for up to one additional year upon a finding that no changes
to the zoning code have been made since the prior approval was granted. Only
one such extension may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. After
the expiration of the approval (including any extension thereof), the approval
shall be deemed null and void, and all regulations governing the subject
property shall be in effect as if no prior approval had ever been granted. The
Building Commissioner shall advise the Secretary of the Planning and Zoning
Commission of the expiration of such approval, and the Clerk shall enter such
expiration upon the Commission’s records.
(Ord. 2019-24. Passed 11-13-19.)
1142.08 NOTIFICATION; SERVICE; COMPLAINT SUMMONS.
   (a)    Upon the report of a condition or perpetration in violation of this
Zoning Code, the Building Commissioner shall immediately examine or cause to be
examined such reported violation. If a violation exists, the Building
Commissioner shall order the owner to take such action to correct the violation
or initiate prosecution of the person responsible for the property.
   (b)    Service of Notice of Violation and/or Complaint Summons to the
Responsible Party,
as defined in Section
1140.04(i) is effectively served by the Building Commissioner when the
Responsible Party receives the Notice or Complaint via personal service,
regular mail or certified mail with return receipt requested. If service cannot
be accomplished via personal service, regular mail or certified mail with
return receipt requested service shall be accomplished via the posting of the
Notice of Violation or the Complaint conspicuously on the premises (e.g. the
front door of the principal building). (Ord. 2025-8. Passed 5-14-25.)
1142.99 PENALTY.
   The owner of any building or premises or part thereof, where anything in
violation of any of the provisions of this Zoning Code is placed or exists, any
architect, builder or contractor who is employed to assist in the commission of
any such violation and all persons or corporations who violate or fail to
comply with any of the provisions of this Zoning Code or any requirements
thereof, or who build in violation of any detailed statement of plans submitted
and approved thereunder, shall, where no other penalty is provided, be fined
not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.

construction of roads. A cluster residential development shall comply with the
following:
   (a)   Minimum Development Area. The gross area of a tract of land proposed
to be developed in a cluster residential development shall be no less than
thirty (30) contiguous acres. For the purposes of this section, in order to be

owner of the property in proceedings before the Village.
   (b)   Maximum Density Permitted. The maximum overall density of a proposed
development shall not exceed one (1) dwelling unit per one-and-a-half (1-1/2)
acres. The maximum number of units shall be calculated by multiplying the total
project area, exclusive of public rights-of-way existing at the time the
development plan is submitted, by the number of dwelling units permitted per
acre.

   The following requirements are provided so that the required off-street
parking facilities will be developed in such a manner as to interfere as little
as possible with the use of neighboring properties and with vehicular traffic
on neighboring streets.
   (a)   Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same
lot as the main building or use served.
   (b)   Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided as follows:
      (1)   When there is more than one shift in operation, the required spaces
shall be related to the number of employees on the combined major and secondary
shifts.
      (2)   For executive offices and sales offices, one space shall be
required per 200 square feet of office floor area.
      (3)   For all other permitted uses, one space shall be required for each
1.5 employees or one space for each 300 square feet of building floor area,
whichever is greater.
      (4)   If the application of the standards set forth in this subsection as
to the number of employees results in fewer parking spaces than required by the
application of the standards set forth in this subsection as to the square feet
of buildings, the Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the construction of
the lesser number of spaces. However, the additional area required to provide
the number of spaces under the square feet of building standard shall be
reserved and held as open area, exclusive of all required yard areas, for
future construction of parking spaces when the number of employees in the
building increases.
      (5)   Where the computation of required off-street parking spaces results
in a fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be
provided.
   (c)   The gross floor area of a building is the total area of all the
floors, including the basement, measured from the exterior faces of the
building.
   (d)   A parking space shall be not less than 180 square feet (nine feet by
twenty feet) exclusive of drives and turning spaces.

water is contained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway is
located in such a manner that water does not drain across other private
property.
   Adequate bumper guards or curbs shall be provided to establish the limits of
the parking area except at exits and entrances. Such guards or curbs shall
restrain the vehicles so that no part of a parked vehicle shall project into
that portion of a required yard in which off-street parking is prohibited.
   (f)   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking
facilities shall be planned, whenever possible, so that the centerline of the
access driveways on the frontage street of a corner lot shall be at least forty
feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street. Whenever
possible, driveways shall be spaced at not less than 120-foot intervals,
measured from the centerline of the driveways.
   Entrances and exits shall be limited to three lanes.
   Entrances to and exits from a U-5 District shall be limited to streets along

an abutting street.
   (c)   Off-street loading spaces shall be provided with surface improvements
as required for parking areas in Section
1158.04(e).
   (d)   The repairing or servicing of motor vehicles is not permitted in a
required off-street loading space. Space required and allocated for off-street
loading shall not be allocated or used to satisfy the space requirements for
required off-street parking.
   (e)   An off-street loading space at least twelve feet wide by at least
twenty-five feet in length shall be provided for a building of less than 10,000
square feet in gross floor area, and an off-street loading space at least

1160.03   Building lines; projections; fences; vegetation.
1160.01 ACCESS TO STREETS REQUIRED.
   No building shall be erected upon a lot or property which does not have
frontage upon a dedicated and improved public street, unless the Building
Inspector, the Chief of Police and the Fire Chief determine that such building
and lot or property are provided with satisfactory and adequate access to a
dedicated public street for purposes of police and fire protection and for the
protection of life and property and with satisfactory access to, and connection
for, necessary utilities.
(Ord. 1959-26. Passed 12-9-59.)
1160.02 SIDE AND REAR YARD OBSTRUCTIONS.
   The area required in a side or rear yard shall be open from the established
grade or from the natural grade, if higher than the established grade, to the
sky, unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of window sills, belt
courses, cornices and other ornamental features to the extent of not more than
four inches.
(Ord. 1942-27. Passed 4-14-42.)
1160.03 BUILDING LINES; PROJECTIONS; FENCES; VEGETATION.
   (a)   For the purposes of regulating front yards, side yards of corner
buildings and the alignment of buildings near street frontages, building lines,
as set forth on the Zone Map, are hereby established. The Map designations and
the designation rules which accompany the Map are hereby declared to be a part
of this chapter as if fully rewritten herein.
   (b)   Between a building line and the street line, no building or portion of
a building extending above the established grade may be erected. In a U-
1 District, a one-story unenclosed porch may, however, be constructed between
the building line and the street line, provided that such unenclosed porch does
not extend more than twelve feet in front of the building line.
(Ord. 1959-26. Passed 12-9-59.)
   (c)   On a corner lot between the building line and the street line, and

   (d)   On any street frontage in a U-1 District, where no building line is
designated on the Map, the location of the building line shall be as follows:
      (1)   On a street frontage on either side of a street between two
intersecting streets, but excluding the frontage along the side line of a
corner lot, the distance of the building line back from the street line shall
be forty percent of the average or normal depth of the lots having their front
lines along such street frontage, but such distance back from the street need
not be more than 100 feet. Where in any portion of such street frontage there
are lots of markedly less depth than normal, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, in defining and applying this building line regulation, may, when
in its opinion the general purposes and intent of this section will be better
served thereby, divide such street frontage into sections for the application
of such forty percent building line requirement. As used in this paragraph,
“lot” includes unimproved parcels in separate ownerships and unimproved lots or
parcels in subdivisions of land.
      (2)   In a U-1 District, along the side line of a corner lot, the
distance of the building line back from the street line shall be twenty percent
of the frontage of such lot, but such distance back from the street line need
not be more than twenty feet.

1161.04 COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area and building frontage:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension of Signs.
      (1)   The sign area shall include the face of all display area(s) of the
sign. The sign area shall include the frame and structural support unless such
structural support is determined to be an architectural or site feature as
defined in Section
 1161.03(a). Architectural features that are either part of the building or
part of a freestanding structure are not considered signs and are this exempt
from these regulations.
      (2)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign
shall be the area of not more than three (3) regular geometric shapes that
encompass the entire area of the sign including the background or frame.
      (3)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregularly shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than
three (3) regular geometric shapes that encompass the perimeter of all of the
elements of the display.
         A.   When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but
the elements are separated by open space, the area of the sign shall include
all the display areas, including the space between the elements.
         B.   Up to five (5) percent of the permitted sign area may be
considered minor protrusions and extend outside of the maximum limitation of
three (3) regular geometric shapes, and are, therefore, exempted from being
included as part of the sign area.
      (4)   For freestanding signs and projecting signs the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces when two (2) identical
display faces are joined, are parallel, or are within thirty (30) degrees of
being parallel to each other and are at no point separated by a distance that
exceeds three (3) feet. For any sign that has two (2) display faces that do not
comply with the above regulation, or has more than two (2) display surfaces,
then each surface shall be included when determining the area of the sign.
In determining the area of freestanding or projecting signs, the following
shall be exempted from being considered as part of the maximum permitted area:
         A.   The portion of a solid sign base or other sign support, up to a
maximum height of four (4) feet that is at least fifty (50) percent screened by
landscaping at the time of installation;.
         B.   The air space under a freestanding sign between supporting posts,
other air space between a projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached.
         C.   Additional base area, framing or structural supports or other
portions of the sign, when such areas are determined to be:
            1.   Constructed and designed with materials which are similar to,
or compatible with, the architecture of the building or other site features;
            2.   Not intended or designed to include messages; and
            3.   Exclusive of colors, trademarks, or any other decorative
design features that are primarily intended to attract attention, rather than
be unobtrusive or compatible with the architecture of the building or other
site features.
   (b)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
this section, the building frontage shall include the building walls that: face
a public street, face a parking lot which serves the use, or contain a public
entrance to the uses therein. The building frontage shall be measured along
such building wall between the exterior faces of the exterior sidewalls. For
multiple-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned or leased
by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit and shall be measured
from the centerline of the party walls defining the building unit.
      (1)   The primary frontage shall be the portion of a frontage that serves
as the main access point to a principal building or building unit.
      (2)   The secondary frontage shall be all other walls with ingress and
egress to the building unit, and walls that face a public right-of-way or
parking facility.
   (c)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of these
regulations, a single glass window shall be the area of all the glass and
mullions that has less than four (4) inches of separation from other glass
areas. For the purposes of determining window area for ground floor occupants,
the ground floor shall only include the glass area to a height of fifteen (15)
feet above the elevation of the first floor of the building.
   (d)   Determining Street Frontage. Street frontage is the length of the
street that is contiguous to the adjacent private parcel for which the sign is
being considered.
   (e)   Determining Sign Setbacks. The required setbacks for any freestanding
sign shall apply to all elements of the sign, including its frame and base.
   (f)   The Planning and Zoning Commission has the authority to interpret the
provisions of this Section
1161.04 in determining the area of any sign. Decisions related to these
interpretations may be appealed to Village Council.

building frontages.
         B.   The sign area permitted on the primary building frontage may,
however, be redistributed along the secondary building frontage(s), provided
that the total sign area facing the secondary street(s) or parking lot does not
exceed the formula set forth in Schedules
1161.05 -
1161.07.
   (c)   Freestanding Signs. One additional freestanding sign shall be
permitted for a corner lot provided that:
      (1)   The total lot frontage of both streets is not less than 300 feet;

purposes of these regulations, a service station canopy shall be considered a
wall. Such signs are in addition to wall-mounted and freestanding signs
otherwise permitted in this Chapter. (Ord. 2016-24. Passed 2-8-17.)
1161.09 ELECTRONIC MESSAGE CENTER SIGNS.
   One (1) permanent freestanding sign greater than twenty (20) square feet,
and otherwise permitted by these regulations, is permitted to use a portion of
such sign as an Electronic Message Center (EMC) in compliance with the

the impact of the EMC on adjacent property.
   (d)   The interval of change of any messages shall occur no less than once
every eight (8) seconds; the Planning Commission may consider a less frequent
interval provided that such greater interval should not be so limited that it
negates the purpose of the EMC which is to view, generally, at least two
messages during a single pass (viewing time) of the motorist.
   (e)   The image of the EMC shall change instantaneously and animation,
movement, or continuous scrolling of messages is prohibited.

(5,000) nits when measured from the sign's face at its maximum brightness,
during daylight hours, and one-hundred-fifty (150) nits when measured from the
sign's face at its maximum brightness between dusk and dawn.
   To minimize brightness the Planning Commission may further control the
colors - particularly the color that dominates the background area of the EMC
or its message - and may limit the nighttime hours that the EMC is illuminated
to assure the brightness of the sign is in line with other illuminated signs
that may be in the vicinity and/or minimize impact on nearby residential
property. (Ord. 2016-24. Passed 2-8-17.)

   (c)   Sign Plan. For multi-tenant buildings and development projects with
multiple buildings, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve basic sign
parameters that set forth the location, size and style of each tenant or
building sign. Such sign parameters may be established when the Planning and
Zoning Commission reviews development plans for new buildings or at the time
that a specific sign application is made for a sign for an existing building.
Whenever the Planning and Zoning Commission has approved such sign parameters,
the Building Commissioner shall be authorized to review and approve any
subsequent sign application submitted for a tenant of the development or
building(s) that complies with such sign parameters.
   (d)   Status of Prior Violations. All violations of the sign regulations
repealed by the adoption of this Zoning Code shall remain violations and all
penalties and enforcement remedies set forth herein shall be available to the
Village as though the violation were a violation of this Zoning Code. However,
if this Zoning Code makes a sign, that was formerly unlawful or non-conforming,
to become lawful and/or conforming, then no enforcement action shall be taken
except for the imposition and collection of penalties for the violations that
occurred prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code or amendment that made
the sign conforming and/or lawful.

1161.17 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   The Village Council shall hear and decide on any request for a variance to
the regulations in this chapter including:
   (a)   The maximum sign area, maximum sign height, and the location of the
sign on the parcel. In evaluating the request for a variance to the maximum
sign height, the Village Council may consider whether there are special
topographic circumstances that would result in a material impairment of
visibility of the sign from the adjacent roadway, which significantly
diminishes the owner's, or user's, ability to continue to communicate
adequately and effectively with the public through the use of the sign.
   (b)   The portion of the sign structure that should be exempt from being
considered part of the sign area if such exemption has not been granted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to Section
1161.04.

conviction thereof, be guilty of a minor misdemeanor for the first violation
and shall be subject to the penalties established for such offenses. Whoever
shall be convicted of a second or additional offence for violation of this
chapter shall be guilty of a fourth degree misdemeanor and shall be subject to
the penalties for such offenses as prescribed by applicable laws. A separate
offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or
non-compliance occurs or continues.

authorize recreational vehicles or trailers to be parked outside of a
completely enclosed garage or other completely enclosed permanent structure
where the Commission determines that such arrangement will not substantially or
permanently impact neighboring properties and is consistent with the spirit and

storage of recreational vehicles or trailers in U-1 Single-Family Dwelling
Districts, the Planning and Zoning Commission may seek recommendations from the
Architectural Board of Review regarding screening and buffering.

may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and/or
structures which were lawful before the Zoning Code was adopted but which do
not conform to regulations and restrictions under the terms of the Zoning Code.

be used as grounds for adding other lots, structures, or uses prohibited in the
same district.
   (b)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been issued and the construction of which was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of the Zoning Code or Amendments thereto and on which
construction has been carried on diligently in accordance with approved plans.

1164.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of any provision of the Zoning Code that could not be built under the
terms of said provision by reason of restrictions on size, height, yards,
setbacks, or lot coverage, such structure may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, altered, or
reconstructed in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any such
structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure be destroyed by any means to an
extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its replacement cost, as
determined by the Building Inspector, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Code;
   (c)   If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due
to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located;
   (d)   Any structure which is nonconforming solely because of its
encroachment in a required yard area may be extended in any lawful manner that
does not further encroach in that yard.

1164.04 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where at the time of passage of any provision of the Zoning Code lawful use
of land and/or structures exists which would not be permitted by said
provision, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code;
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code;
   (c)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of the
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use;
   (d)   When any nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the use
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and no
nonconforming use shall thereafter be resumed;
   (e)   If any such nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of
more than six months, any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations
specified by the Zoning Code for the district in which such land is located;
(Ord. 2002-53. Passed 12-11-02.)
   (f)   Removal or destruction of the structure occupied by such nonconforming
use shall eliminate the nonconforming status. Destruction for the purpose of
this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent of
the replacement cost. No nonconforming use shall be established after said
destruction or removal;
   (g)   If a nonconforming use is altered so as to increase its conformity, it
may not, at any time, revert to its previous level of nonconformity.

1172.01 PREAMBLE.
   The Village contains large parcels of land which have not been developed to
their full potential. The development of these parcels for single family use
exclusively is deemed impracticable, while their classification for ordinary
local retail store, office or commercial use would not be in keeping with the
best interests of the Village. These parcels may be placed in a zoning category
which will permit thereon combinations of development such as attached single-
family units, extended care facilities, senior citizen dwelling units, retail
establishments conducted wholly within enclosed buildings, commercial buildings
and offices, including professional, governmental, public utility, executive
and administrative offices, set back from streets in landscaped surroundings.
The basic standards for this use classification are in Sections
1172.04 through
1172.09. "Commission" means the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 1985-35. Passed 8-14-85. )
1172.02 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the S-1A Special Residential, Retail, Office District is to
designate, regulate and restrict the location, design and use of buildings,
structures and interior streets; to promote high standards of external
appearance of buildings and grounds; to stabilize and improve property values
with the least burden on Village services and facilities and the highest return
to the Village from tax revenues consistent with maintaining and improving the
residential character of the Village; to promote health, safety, comfort,
convenience and the general welfare; and thus to provide the economic and
social advantages resulting from an orderly, planned use of these large parcels
of land.
(Ord. 1985-35. Passed 8-14-85.)
1172.03 REQUIRED AREA.
   The required area shall be a parcel of land with an area of not less than
twenty acres. The entire parcel need not be developed at any one time.
(Ord. 1985-35. Passed 8-14-85.)

   (a)   Residential. Similar compatible and harmonious main uses which do not
impair or interfere with permitted uses in this District which are permitted in
the U-2 and U-3 Districts are permitted in the S-1A Special Residential,
Retail, Office District, subject to the same terms, provisions, conditions and
limitations imposed in relation to such uses and associated accessory uses to
the foregoing uses. Provisions in such foregoing uses relating to density,
whether expressed by such terms as lot areas, units per acre, lots per acre, or
otherwise, shall be interpreted to permit but not require the Planning and
Zoning Commission to allow not more than twenty percent (20%) increase in
density for residential uses, for purposes of this District. Provisions
relating to unit size, or other dimensional provisions relating to yards,
parking areas, etc. contained in such foregoing uses shall be unaffected by
this provision.
   (b)   Retail, Commercial, Office. Similar compatible and harmonious main and
conditional uses which do not impair or interfere with permitted uses in this
District which are permitted in the U-4 and U-6 Districts are permitted in the
S-1A Special Residential, Retail, Office District, subject to the same terms,
provisions, conditions and limitations imposed in relation to such uses and
associated accessory uses to the foregoing uses. Provisions in such foregoing
uses relating to density, whether expressed by such terms as lot coverage per
building, ground coverage per building, or otherwise, shall be interpreted to
permit but not require the Commission to allow not more than a ten percent
(10%) increase in density for nonresidential uses, for purposes of this
District. Provisions relating to square footage per building, or other
dimensional provisions relating to yards, height, parking area, etc. contained
in such foregoing uses shall be unaffected by this provision.
   In any portion of a parcel which is devoted to retail, commercial or office
use, conformity with the following standards shall be required:
(1)   Parking. Not less than two square feet of off-street parking space for
each square foot of rentable building area shall be provided in the planned
development. Rentable building area shall not include washrooms, mechanical
equipment rooms, storerooms, corridors, service rooms, etc.

1 property fronting on a through highway. In addition, each building shall be
located not less than a total of 400 feet from the most northerly boundary line
of the entire tract of land (as defined in the legal description), as these
lines existed when such tract was transferred to the S-1A Special District.
When such 100-foot strip of land is located along a street, there shall be
reserved along that street a portion of such strip of a depth not exceeding
forty feet sufficient in the judgment of the Planning and Zoning Commission for
widening of that street, which strip of land shall constitute all or part of
the forty-foot strip referred to in Section
1172.08.
   (b)   Portions of a parcel within 100 feet of property, abutting the
easterly or westerly boundary line, or within 400 feet of property abutting the
most northerly boundary line as required in this section, in the U-1 District
shall remain vacant and be so mounded and landscaped that U-2, U-3, U-4 and U-
6 development in the S-1A zoning district shall be not visible year-round from
the rear building line of land zoned U-1 outside of the development.
(Ord. 1985-35. Passed 8-14-85.)
1172.07 STANDARDS OF QUALITY.
   Buildings and structures shall be of sizes, heights, locations and designs
which will best accomplish the development of a parcel, or any portion thereof,

computing the twenty percent (20%) there shall be included as a part thereof
that portion of the area specified in Section
1172.06, which remains vacant and planted and which does not constitute
reserved parking area in the site plan approved by the Commission.
   (b)    The owners of landscaped property shall be required to maintain it in
a suitable manner and the plan of development shall set forth to the
satisfaction of the Commission provisions to assure such maintenance.

1173.01 PURPOSES AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Planned Mixed-Use Development (PM-UD) District is established to
encourage the comprehensive design and integrated development of large tracts
of land suitable for a variety of mutually supportive office, commercial and
transient residential uses.
   (b)   The general purposes of this District are served by the following
basic principles:
(1)   Comprehensive planning of large tracts promotes more ordered urban
growth, providing opportunities for the integration of various development
projects in clearly identifiable growth centers throughout the region.
(2)   With comprehensive planning, different uses can be successfully
integrated to provide functional convenience, efficiencies in the provision of
public services and infrastructure and more consistent levels of activity in an
area throughout the day, at night and on weekends.
(3)   With comprehensive planning and integrated design, higher densities of
development can be accommodated while maintaining environmental quality. The
general benefits of density include greater productivity of land; more
efficient utilization of transportation and utilities systems; more convenient
access between developments; the provision of a higher level of pedestrian and
open space amenities; and the concentration within a limited area of people
necessary to support retail, convenience service and entertainment functions.
(4)   Comprehensive planning and design of large tracts provides for the more
detailed definition and administration of architectural and landscape design
controls, producing a visually harmonious and pleasing development environment.
   (c)   These various advantages of comprehensively planned and designed
mixed-use developments cannot be achieved by application of existing standards
for individual use types. The PM-UD District, therefore, is a special zoning
classification, providing for a variety of development types under special
development standards that are only appropriate to the uses in planned
combination.
(Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.02 PERMITTED MAIN USES.
   (a)   Intent. The intent of the PM-UD District is not to limit the variety
of potential uses in the development, but to insure that only uses of a
compatible and mutually supportive nature are included, at sufficient density,
and with sufficient architectural landscape design conformity to achieve the
overall benefits of mixed-use development.
   (b)   Permitted Main Uses. The following main uses are permitted in a PM-UD
District:
      (1)   Office buildings and offices including business, financial,
professional, governmental, public utility, executive and administrative.
         (Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
      (2)   Hotels and motels subject, however, to the restrictions contained
in Section
1173.04(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Zoning Code, hotels and
motels in the PM-UD District shall be permitted to have microwave ovens in the
guest rooms of the hotel or motel.
         (Ord. 2017-3. Passed 2-8-17.)
(3)   Full service restaurants.
      (4)   Banks and other financial services.
      (5)   Park land use which shall be the designated use within the PM-UD
District until such time as a request is made and approved for another
permitted main use.
      (6)   Other uses similar to those enumerated above as determined by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and confirmed by Council.
         (Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
   (c)   Full Service Restaurant. As used in this Chapter, “Full Service
Restaurant” means a place where food and beverages are sold and consumed on-
premises within a completely enclosed building; provided, however, that limited
outdoor seating and carry-out service may be permitted. A Full Service

(Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.04 AREA REGULATIONS.
   The following area regulations shall apply to each development site in a PM-
UD District:
(a)   Site Area. A minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) acres in the
Village is required for each Planned, Mixed-Use Development District. This area
may, however, be separated by interstate freeways, local highways or existing
public right-of-way or utilities easements, but shall otherwise be comprised of
contiguous acreage. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the developable
area in the Village may be devoted to motel and/or hotel usages. "Developable
area", as used in this subsection, shall be deemed to include all required
setback areas including but not limited to parking and building setbacks. To
provide greater flexibility to the development and implementation process, the
overall Planned Mixed-Use Development District may be subdivided subsequent to
overall plan approval. Individual parcels thus created, however, shall remain
subject to the development requirements and design standards established in the
overall plan for the development district.
(b)   Site Coverage. Total impervious coverage throughout the development site
is limited to a maximum of eighty percent (80%) of the overall site area in the
Village. Impervious coverage includes building footprints, all paved vehicular
surfaces such as access drives, parking, service and loading area, and paved
pedestrian facilities including pathways and plazas.
(c)   Open Space. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the development site
area in the Village shall be maintained as permeable surface open space,
including areas of preservation of the existing natural landscape and new
planting areas. Landscaped portions of off-street parking areas shall qualify
as part of the open space requirements.
      (Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.05 HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   Considering the varying building types in a mixed-use development, different
height regulations are proposed for each of the primary uses.
(a)   Office Buildings. No office building in a Planned Mixed-Use Development
shall be more than one hundred twenty (120) feet.
(b)   Hotel Development. The maximum height of buildings containing hotel
functions shall be no more than one hundred twenty (120) feet. This height
limit is to be maintained, regardless of the mixture of supporting or
independent functions, such as meeting rooms, restaurants or rentable office
space, included in the same structure.
(Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.06 YARD REGULATIONS. 
   Considering a Planned Mixed-Use Development is initially planned as a total
entity, without necessarily specifying subdivision into individual development
parcels, these yard regulations apply only to the entire development site. If
the site is subdivided subsequent to overall planned approval, boundary
setbacks and design requirements must be maintained in all affected parcels,
but internal parcels created by subdivision are not subject to these yard
regulations.
(a)   Street Setbacks. The location of buildings and off-street parking areas
within a PM-UD District shall be in accordance with the following schedule:
                                       Harvard Road and Other
                                       Dedicated Streets
Front Building Setback                 From Right-of-Way Line
(Building height 60 feet or less)      75 feet
(Building height greater than 60 feet) 100 feet or building height x 1.1,
                                       whichever is greater.
Front Parking Setback                  20 feet
Side Building Setback
(Building height 60 feet or less)      50 feet
(Building height greater than 60 feet) Equal to height of building
                                       10 feet except where adjoining
Side/Rear Parking and/or               residential property in which case
      Roadway Setback          parking and/or roadway shall be set back
                                       a minimum of 35 feet.
 
   (b)   Side and Rear Yard Setbacks. All side and rear yards of a Planned
Mixed-Use Development site are to be adequately buffered from adjacent
development, with setback requirements varying according to the nature of such
development:
(1)   Yards adjoining residential property shall be the greater of 100 feet; or
A.   Equal to the height of the building times 1.1 if north of Harvard Road;
B.   Equal to the height of the building times 2 if south of Harvard Road.
(2)   For yards adjoining commercial and institutional property, the minimum
building setback is 50 feet; and

(Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.07 CIRCULATION AND ACCESS TO STREETS.
   Successful planning of an integrated Mixed-Use Development will depend, to a
large extent, on the definition of an efficient vehicular circulation system.
The basic elements of such a system are:
(a)   Direct access to the regional transportation network;
(b)   Appropriate connection to existing streets through and around the site
that maintains the designed capacity of these streets; and
(c)   A clear pattern of internal circulation that provides adequate access to
all functions within the development and appropriately distributes site
generated traffic to the existing street system of the area.
(Ord. 1989-23. Passed 8-9-89.)
1173.08 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   Off-street parking in a PM-UD District shall be in accordance with the
following schedule:

   The following planning guidelines are established to guide the planning,
development and use of the land in a OPS-PDD.
   (a)    Landscaping prototypes for buffering, parking islands, pedestrian
areas and site amenities for all Sub-Districts shall be depicted on the
Preliminary Development Plan.
   (b)    Parking lots shall be screened from adjacent residential uses and
public streets with dense evergreen hedges or trees and/or earthen mounds or
other effective screening as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (c)    Lighting of drives, sidewalks and parking areas shall be adequate to
provide safety, but the location, number, height, and level of illumination
shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the FDP.
Lighting shall be designed to not have excessive brightness, to not have light
trespass on adjacent property and to not create "hot spots" of light.
   (d)    The development shall be designed to utilize the natural contours of
the land, economize in the construction of utilities, and reduce the amount of
grading to the extent practicable.
   (e)    Utility services including gas, water, sewers, electric, cable and
telephone, shall be installed underground in compliance with relevant Village
ordinances and all other applicable regulations and requirements.
   (f)    Pedestrian facilities shall be constructed throughout the development
providing access to common facilities, abutting roads and commercial areas, and
Village paths and bikeways.
   (g)    Retention/detention, when proposed as open basins or ponds, shall be
designed to be an integral part of an amenity to the development. The borders
of retention basins shall have natural or curvilinear shapes and shall be
planted with grass and trees to blend in with the landscape features of the
development. Where deep basins are constructed, protection shall be provided to
prevent pedestrians or vehicles from dangers arising from the design of these
facilities, and such protection may include, but is not limited to, fences,
guard rails or other warning devices as deemed necessary.
   (h)    In SD 3, the open space shall be guaranteed from further subdivision
and/or use through deed restrictions or covenants. All such open space shall be
maintained by the homeowner association or other entity as approved by the
Village.
   (i)    Private streets shall be constructed to Village construction
standards for public streets unless an alternate standard is approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in connection with the approval of an FDP. All
private streets in Sub-Districts SD-3 shall be within an easement granted to
the Village which assures perpetual public access. All private streets shall be
accessible for the provision of municipal services. The land areas of the
designated private streets shall be maintained by the owners thereof.
   (j)    Trash storage containers and compactors shall be enclosed with a
masonry wall at such minimum height, but not less than six (6) feet, as
necessary to fully screen the top of any trash storage device on three sides
with a closable door/gate on the fourth side. Trash enclosures shall be
screened with landscaping and located as depicted on an FDP.
   (k)    Where required by the Planning Commission, sound barriers shall be
installed for all HVAC, outdoor refrigeration systems, trash compactors and
other similar or related improvements located in Sub-Districts SD-1.
   (l)   Green space and landscape area shall be provided within Districts SD1,
SD2, and SD3 as a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the overall developed area
of the combined districts. This area may include, but not be limited to
landscaped areas, plantings, natural areas, walks, plazas site features,
seating areas, and other features as directed and approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 12-6-23.)
1174.10 COMMERCIAL BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.
   (a)    The building designs within each District will include a variety of
building arrangements including, but not limited to, the bulk and shape of the
buildings, open space and landscape features and architectural styles, with
buildings arranged in various groups, courts or clusters with open spaces
related to the buildings to create a harmonious and coordinated architectural
design for the entire development area.
   (b)    Exteriors of buildings shall have finished materials on all sides
except those that face nonpublic or service areas that are thoroughly screened.
Exterior Finished materials shall not include exposed concrete, cinder block,
or acrylic stucco (commonly known as "dryvit" or "EIFS") except when it is used
as an accent in association with recessed or protruding belt courses, wide
reveals, or combinations thereof.
   (c)    A combination of materials, textures, colors and finishes are to be
used to create visual interest.
   (d)    While flexibility in design is encouraged, the following design
standards shall be
incorporated in each FDP.
      (1)    When the wall of a building faces a public right-of-way, or public
parking area, or is within forty five (45) degrees of facing a public right-of-
way, such walls shall have no more than twenty (20) feet of contiguous wall
length, on any ground floor, unless the wall includes architectural features

requirements.
      (7)   Building and site design criteria, text and illustrations,
conforming with the illustrative site plan, as amended, that demonstrate the
high quality of design through:
         A.   The use of building elements providing an articulate
architectural vocabulary using materials, details and forms to provide a scale
and relationship for a varied and refined pedestrian experience;
         B.   The use of building materials such as stone, brick, cultured
stone, split-face concrete masonry (no painted or integrally colored concrete
masonry except in non-public or service areas that are thoroughly screened),
metals, glass, wood, fiber cement siding, spandrel material;
         C.   The limited use of acrylic stucco (exterior Insulation Finish
System), only for trim, moldings or shapes, shall not comprise more than 20% of
any single wall elevation; and
         D.   The use of multiple layers of materials, steps in the facades
(both vertical and horizontal) and levels to break down the apparent size and
scale of building segments.
      (8)   Sight line drawings as required pursuant to Section
1175.07(a).
      (9)   Sign standards and criteria.

restrictions required by the Planning and Zoning Commission. This shall
include, but not be limited to, traffic studies sufficiently demonstrating that
ingress and egress to and from the site and on-site circulation are adequate to
meet the needs of the development and will not be unreasonably detrimental to
the surrounding road system or the Village.
The approved Preliminary Development Plan and any development agreements,
covenants and restrictions submitted by an applicant shall continue to govern
the development and/or redevelopment of property in the PPDD District by any
successor or assignee of the applicant.
   (c)   Plan Amendments: If changes are proposed to an approved PDP they will
be considered pursuant to the following:
      (1)   Administrative Amendments: The Village Planning and Zoning
Commission at the request of the applicant will consider an amendment(s) to the
PDP pursuant to Chapter
1143 when the revision(s):
         A.   Are consistent with the development standards (Sections
1175.06 through
1175.10) for each Sub-District; or
         B.   Do not alter the boundaries of Sub-Districts PD-1 through PD-5 in
a manner that increases or decreases the area of any Sub-District by more than
30%; provided, however, that such alterations shall not decrease the area of
Sub-District PD-2; or
         C.   Requests to use the property in Sub-Districts PD-1, PD-2, PD-3,
or PD-4 for a similar use that is not expressly permitted under this Chapter or
any development agreement pertaining to the PPDD; or
         D.   Requests permission to exceed the building requirements set forth
in Schedule
1175.06(a).
A proposed amendment that is submitted pursuant to subsection (c)(l)A, B, C and
D above, or that seeks to develop the property other than as set forth in the
PDP, as it may be amended, will be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission if it determines that such amendment is compatible with the
character of the development and the intent and purposes of this District. In
evaluating such amendment the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
following factors:
      •   The extent to which the request deviates from the provisions of this
Chapter or the provisions of any applicable development agreement pertaining to
the PPDD;
      •   The level of occupancy and the mix of uses in the development at the
time of such request;
      •   Whether a traffic study shows that the traffic impacts can be
mitigated with the same traffic control measures as have already been approved
for the development or can be ameliorated with other traffic control measures
that the Developer is willing and able to implement at its expense;
      •   Whether the requested amendment is consistent with the demographic
target of the uses in the development at the time of such request and other
uses proposed for the development; and
      •   Other regional or local trends "that may have a bearing on the
quality or economics of the development.
With respect to a request pursuant to this Subsection (c)(l)C and D, and at the
request of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the applicant shall select at
least one person with expertise relating to real estate leasing or development
to assist the Planning and Zoning Commission in determining whether such
amendment is compatible with the character of the development.
      (2)   Legislative Amendments:
         A.   Village Council, pursuant to Chapter
1144, will consider an amendment to the PDP, with a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, but not requiring a referendum vote, when the
revisions:
            1.   Include uses that are not specifically listed as a permitted
main use in Section
1175.05 and the Planning and Zoning Commission has determined such proposed use
is not a similar use pursuant to Subsection (c)(l)C above. Nevertheless,
Village Council, with the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation,
determines that the proposed use(s) is nonetheless consistent with the
purposes, intent, and quality characteristics of this Chapter and related
covenants, restrictions, and agreements; or
            2.   Alter the boundaries of any Sub-District beyond the
limitations specified in subsection (c)(1) B, above.
         B.   Village Council, pursuant to Chapter
1144, will consider an amendment to the PDP, with a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and subject to a referendum vote in the manner
provided by
Article Ill, Section 13, et seq., of the Orange Village Charter, when the
revisions are proposed to alter the boundaries of or uses in PD-6.
Any approved amendment(s) shall be the binding development rights and
restrictions for the PPDD and shall replace the previously approved PDP, as it
may be amended.
   (d)   Final Development Plan: Subsequent to the rezoning, including the
approval of the Preliminary PDP, no use shall be established or building
constructed or altered except pursuant to the approval of a Final Development
Plan as provided in Chapter
1143. A Final Development Plan shall be in substantial compliance with the
approved PDP, as it may be amended, and may be submitted and approved for a
phase or portion of the project area. Such Final Development Plan shall also
include:
      (1)   Site lighting including the height and location of poles and
fixtures, lighting sources and power ratings, the amount of illumination and a
photometric study Indicating the light levels at all site locations including
the perimeter property lines. Such information shall be provided with
sufficient detail so that the Village is assured that the light trespass beyond
the property lines will be zero and the site lighting will have no adverse
impact on surrounding properties.
      (2)   Sound studies that document the current sound levels which provide
the base line to measure and evaluate the expected change once the project is
constructed, with the intention of minimizing sound impacts on adjacent and
other nearby residential property. This sound study should be undertaken using
state of the art engineering practices.
      (3)   Final drainage and detention plan including all water quality and
Best Management Practice (BMP) devices, appurtenances, systems, detention/
retention basins, permeable pavements, pavement design designations and other
engineering calculations as required to determine the adequacy of storm water
management for the project.

public streets with dense evergreen hedges or trees and/or earthen mounds or
other effective screening as lllustrated on the Preliminary Development Plan,
as it may be amended.
   (c)   Lighting of drives, sidewalks and parking areas shall be adequate to
provide safety but the location, number, height and level of illumination shall
be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Council as part
of the Final Development Plan. Lighting shall be designed to not have excessive
brightness, to not have light trespass on adjacent property and to not create
"hot spots" of light.
   (d)   The development shall be designed to utilize the natural contours of
the land, economize in the construction of utilities, and reduce the amount of
grading to the extent practicable.
   (e)   Utility services including gas, water, sewers, electric, cable and
telephone, shall be installed underground in compliance with relevant Village
ordinances and all other applicable regulations and requirements.
   (f)   Exclusive of Sub-District PD-6, the development shall include a system
of pedestrian plazas and walkways that interconnect the entire development and,
to the extent reasonably feasible, with Village pedestrian paths and bikeways
outside the development to the extent such paths and bikeways adjoin the
development. Such connections shall include other features such as decorative
street furniture, outdoor seating, bicycle facilities, decorative pavement to
indicate pedestrian areas and crosswalks, and traffic calming measures as
appropriate.

of retention basins shall have natural or curvilinear shapes and shall be
planted with grass and trees to blend in with the landscape features of the
development. Where deep basins occur, adequate protection is to be provided to
prevent pedestrians or vehicles from dangers arising from the design of these
facilities, and such protection may include, but is not limited to, fences,
guard rails or other warning devices as deemed necessary.
   (h)   In Sub-District PD-6, the open space shall be guaranteed from further
subdivision and/or use through deed restrictions or covenants. All such open

alternate standard is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission at the
time the Final Development Plan is approved. All private streets in Sub-
Districts PD-1, PD-3 and PD -4 shall be within an easement granted to the
Village which assures perpetual public access. All private streets in PD-
5 shall be accessible for the provision of municipal services. The land areas
of the designated private streets shall be maintained by the owners thereof.

      (Ord. 2018-19. Passed 6-6-18.)
   (n)   As a condition to the issuance of any building permit for any
improvements in Sub Districts PD-1 through PD-5, the applicant’s project
architect or civil engineer shall certify in writing to the Village and the
Waterford Court residents owning units adjacent to Sub-District PD-6 that
persons standing on the second floor of a dwelling on Waterford Court will not
be able to see any building, roof type device (i.e. mechanical and/or
communication equipment) or other improvements in Sub-Districts PD-1 through
PD-5 based on the architectural plans for such improvements.
      (Ord. 2014-3. Passed 4-9-14.)
   (o)   Upon completion of construction of the development, the ambient (i.e.,
background) noise level on Waterford Court as measured using the A weighted
decibel scale shall not increase in a manner perceptible by the average human
ear as determined by a sound professional comparing sound studies that document
the pre- and post-construction sound levels using a variety of sound level
descriptors.

1176.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within Orange Village contributes to the health, safety,
and general welfare of the residents of Orange Village. The specific purpose
and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses and developments within
riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit Orange Village by minimizing encroachment on watercourse
channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as gabion baskets
and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic beauty and
environment of Orange Village, and thereby preserving the character of Orange
Village, the quality of life of the residents of Orange Village, and
corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect and enhance
these functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures, uses, and related soil disturbing activities within a riparian
setback along designated watercourses in Orange Village.

operation until the deposit is restored to its full original balance. Upon
completion of the work or operation, the owner or his or her agent shall notify
the Commissioner to make an inspection of the premises to determine whether or

shall be charged for each inspection after the first one. After each inspection
the Building Commissioner shall make all proper deductions for the cost of
replacements, repairs or cleaning up performed by the Village in connection
with such work or operation and shall authorize a refund of any balance of such
deposit or collect any deficiency from such deposit due.

grading, filling or the hauling of earth to or from a site for such
construction. The Building Commissioner shall cause to be removed all earth,
debris or building material which may be placed, left or permitted to remain on
any pavement, berm, tree lawn or ditch, or upon any private property in the
Village without proper permission, unless the owner or his or her agent
promptly causes such earth, debris or material to be removed. The cost of such
removal shall be charged against the owner
or his or her agent, as provided in this section. (Ord. 1998-5. Passed 2-11-
98.)

 1327.01 and Section
1327.07 that are not claimed by a lawful owner within five years from deposit,

human occupation. The property owner or owners of any dwelling found to be
uninhabitable by the Building Commissioner shall take any and all action
necessary to correct the condition or conditions that resulted in an
uninhabitable dwelling finding by the Building Commissioner. An uninhabitable
dwelling, for purposes of this section, is a dwelling containing conditions

to any person residing in the dwelling. Such conditions may include the
following:
      (1)    Excessive garbage and refuse within the dwelling;
      (2)   Beds and bathtubs holding or containing items to the extent that
there is no room for sleeping or bathing;

   The Building Commissioner, when necessary, may consult with the Fire Chief,
Police Chief and the County Board of Health in making a determination that a
dwelling is uninhabitable.
   (d)   A determination by the Building Commissioner that a dwelling is
uninhabitable shall be appealable pursuant to Section
1331.07 of the Codified Ordinances
   
   (e)   No person shall reside in any dwelling found to be an uninhabitable
dwelling by the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 2011-28. Passed 2-8-12.)
1331.06 ABATEMENT.
   (a)    Upon the discovery of a condition which violates Section
1331.05, the Building Commissioner may cause, in compliance with Section
1323.02, written notice of such condition to be served upon the responsible
party, specifying a reasonable time within which such condition must be removed
or abated.
   (b)    Right of Appeal.
      (1)   Within thirty (30) days of the date of service of notice, any
person affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Planning
and Zoning Commission by filing a written request with the Village’s Building
Department Administrator. The Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty (30) days
therefrom, and upon five (5) days notice to the party and the Building
Inspector, set the matter down for hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in part, any action required to
correct or abate the violation set forth in the notice and shall issue an order
incorporating its determinations, and such order shall be a final order as to
these administrative proceedings, provided, however, that any order of
modification or dismissal shall be effective for two (2) years following the
date of issuance of such order, and thereafter the subject matter of such order
of modification or dismissal may be amenable to further inspection, notice and
appeal as set forth herein.
      (2)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider only the
fbllowing in determining appropriate action to be taken:
         A.    That any modification of the original order of the Building
Inspector shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this chapter
and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants or the
health, safety, or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or
of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.    That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and
unnecessary hardship on the owner by reason of compelling an expenditure for
repair of the premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any
benefit to health, safety, or welfare of the community that might be derived
therefrom.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Code
shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner from complying with any such other provision, nor any official of the
Village from enforcing any such other provision.
   (c)    Any person failing to remove or abate a condition as stated in this
section shall be liable to the Village for a one hundred dollar ($100.00)
administrative charge as well as all costs of such removal or abatement. The
charges incurred for the abatement of such condition shall be forwarded to the
noncomplying person by delivering such notice to him or her personally or by
certified mail sent to the tax mailing address of the owner of the lot, land or
upon which such condition arose. If such charges are not paid within thirty
days after submission for payment, they shall be certified to the County
Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the County, with
interest and penalties allowed by law, and such charges shall be collected
along with
real property taxes. (Ord. 2025-9. Passed 5-14-25.)

1333.01 PURPOSES; INSPECTIONS BY THE BUILDING INSPECTOR AND FIRE INSPECTOR.
   This commercial maintenance code is intended to regulate all commercial
structures and properties in the Village. The purposes of this chapter are to
establish minimum standards necessary to make exterior property areas and parts
of structure safe, sanitary, free from fire and health hazards, fit for human
occupancy and beneficial to the public welfare; to establish minimum standards
governing the maintenance of such structures and exterior property areas in
such condition as to prevent blight or deteriorating conditions in the
neighborhood and the Village; to apply responsibilities for owners and
occupants of commercial structures with respect to sanitation, repair and
maintenance; to authorize the inspection of land and structures; to establish
enforcement procedures; to authorize the vacation or condemnation of structures
unsafe or unfit for human occupancy; and to provide penalties for violations.
(Ord. 1999-53. Passed 1-5-00.)
1333.02 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this Commercial Maintenance Code shall be supplementary to
all other ordinances of the Village relating to the construction, use and
maintenance of commercial buildings and shall apply to all such buildings or
portions thereof.
(Ord. 1999-53. Passed 1-5-00.)
1333.03 APPLICATION.
   Every commercial building, and the property on which it is situated, used or
intended to be used for commercial occupancy, shall comply with the provisions
of this Code, whether or not such building shall have been constructed,
altered, or repaired before or after the adoption of this Code, and without
regard to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or
occupancy of the building or premises for the construction or repair of the
building, or for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to
the effective date of this Code. This Code establishes standards for the
initial and continued occupancy and use of all structures and does not replace
or modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration, or use of the building.
(Ord. 1999-53. Passed 1-5-00.)
1333.04 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance of the Village or law of the State, then
the standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the
Village or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such
other ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 1999-53. Passed 1-5-00.)
1333.05 ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of the provisions of this chapter shall be the
responsibility of the Building Inspector, together with such additional
enforcement officers as may be designated by the Mayor.
   (a)   Inspection. All commercial buildings and premises within the Village
are subject to exterior inspections periodically by the Building Inspector.
Except in case of emergency, such inspection shall be preceded by written
notice of the inspection given to the property owner at least forty-eight (48)
hours before the inspection.
   (b)    Notification; Service; Complaint Summons. Building Code notification,
service and complaint summonses shall be issued in compliance with Section
1323.02.
Notice shall be served personally or by certified mail to the last known
address of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof at the usual
residence of the person to be served. If service cannot he completed as
provided above, service may be accomplished if the Building Commissioner posts
the Notice of Violation and/or the Complaint conspicuously on the property
(e.g. on the front door of the principal building).
 
(c)   Right of Appeal.
      (1)   Within thirty (30) days of the date of service of notice, any
person affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Planning
and Zoning Commission by filing a written request with the Village’s Building
Department Administrator. The Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty (30) days
therefrom, and upon five (5) days notice to the party and the Building
Inspector, set the matter down for hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in part, any action required to
correct or abate the violation set forth in the notice and shall issue an order
incorporating its determinations, and such order shall be a final order as to
these administrative proceedings, provided, however, that any order of
modification or dismissal shall be effective for two years following the date
of issuance of such order, and thereafter the subject matter of such order of
modification or dismissal may be amenable to further inspection, notice and
appeal as set forth herein.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider only the
following in determining appropriate action to be taken:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Building
Inspector shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this chapter
and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants or the
health, safety, or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or
of the immediate neighborhood; and
B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary hardship
on the owner by reason of compelling an expenditure for repair of the premises
which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety,
or welfare of the community that might be derived therefrom.
No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Code shall
constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner from complying with any such other provision, nor any official of the
Village from enforcing any such other provision.
(Ord. 1999-53. Passed 1-5-00; Ord. 2025-9. Passed 5-14-25.)

adopt, amend, and repeal all rules, regulations or procedures not inconsistent
with the laws of the State of Ohio and the Village’s Charter and ordinances,
governing its procedure under the provisions of this chapter, and to put into
effect the purposes of the Board, set forth in Article V,

1335.02 APPLICATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE; APPEAL.
   (a)   Each application for a building permit involving exterior design shall
include or have attached thereto a plot plan showing the proposed location,
grading, plans (including elevations), color schemes, material samples and
specifications showing the detail of the building or other structure proposed
to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, extended, enlarged or
otherwise altered in any manner which affects the appearance of said building
or structure. The applicant shall also submit a plan of any landscape features
which are being installed as a part of the proposed project. Such application
and plans shall be submitted to the Architectural Board of Review, which shall
study the application and accompanying documents required hereunder and may
make recommendations to the applicant in regard to the provisions set forth in
the Village Charter, and in this chapter.
   (b)   If the Architectural Board of Review finds that the exterior design
and accompanying documents conform to the provisions of the Village Charter and
ordinances, it may approve the application or, if such design and documents do
not conform, it may conditionally approve them by specifying modifications
which would make the same acceptable. Or, if the Board finds the exterior
design for a building or structure would produce one or more of the harmful
effects set forth in
Section 9(D)(4) of Article V of the Charter of the Village, or otherwise not
comply with this chapter, the Board shall disapprove the application, design
and accompanying documents. In the event the Board fails to act upon the plans
within one hundred and twenty days of the filing date of the application, the
application will be deemed to be disapproved.
   (c)   If the Architectural Board of Review makes any determination adverse
to any interested party, that party shall have twenty (20) days within which to
file a notice of appeal of that decision with the Building Inspector. Council
shall place the matter for hearing on the agenda for the next regular council
meeting following the filing of the notice of appeal, provided the notice of
appeal is filed at least ten (10) days prior to the next council meeting
otherwise Council shall place the appeal on the agenda of the subsequent
regular meeting. Council shall decide the appeal within ninety days of the
filing of the notice of appeal, unless the applicant requests additional time
for decision. A failure by Council to decide the matter within ninety days of
the notice of appeal shall be deemed to be an affirmance of the decision of the
Board. Unless Council fails to decide the matter within ninety days of the
notice of appeal, Council shall issue a written decision, which shall include
conclusions of fact. In the event the Council reverses or modifies the decision
of the Architectural Board of Review, the Mayor shall endorse the approval or
modification, ordered by Council, as provided in Section
1335.03.
(Ord. 2000-17. Passed 6-7-00.)
1335.03 APPROVAL OF DESIGN; ENDORSEMENT OF PLANS.
   Approval or disapproval of the plot plan and of the design and accompanying
documents shall be endorsed thereon by the Architectural Board of Review by its
Chair, or by the Mayor in the event of Councilmatic action, as described in
Section
1335.02(c). In the event the Board or Council issues conditional approval, the
conditions shall be noted in writing upon the appropriate plans to which the
conditions apply. The Building Inspector shall not release any bond held for
the project unless and until the conditions noted on the plans have been
satisfied.
(Ord. 2000-17. Passed 6-7-00.)
1335.04 CHANGES FROM APPROVED PLANS PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No person may alter plans which have been approved by the
Architectural Board of Review in any manner which affects the exterior
appearance of the building or other structure which is being erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, extended, enlarged or otherwise altered.
   (b)   No person shall erect, construct, reconstruct, move, extend, enlarge
or otherwise alter a building in a fashion which is in any way inconsistent
with plans approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
(Ord. 2000-17. Passed 6-7-00.)
1335.05 EVALUATION STANDARDS.  
   (a)    Excessive Dissimilarity. The exterior design of a building or
structure, site plan or landscape plan shall not be excessively dissimilar to
any other existing building, structure, site plan or landscape plan in the
immediate vicinity of the proposed building, structure, site plan or landscape
plan. For the purposes of this section, a building, structure, site plan or
landscape plan shall be deemed to be “existing” if a valid permit has been
issued for its construction.
   (b)    Excessive Similarity. The exterior design of a building, structure,
site plan or landscape plan shall not be excessively similar in relation to any
other building, structure, site plan or landscape plan, existing or for which a
permit has been issued, on a lot within seven hundred fifty feet (750') of the
proposed site and located on the same street therewith, particularly any of the
following features of exterior design:
      (1)   Facade. An elevation shall not be apparently identical, including
the size and arrangement of either doors, windows, porches, or other openings
or breaks in the facade, nor shall there be a directly reverse arrangement;
      (2)   Other significant features. Architectural features, including but
not limited to materials, roof line, or other design elements shall not be
apparently identical;
   (c)   Inappropriate design. If, based upon evidence in the record, the Board
determines that a building, structure, site plan or landscape plan is
inconsistent with the predominant architectural style of the structure, or is
otherwise inconsistent with other elements of the design of the building,
structure, site plan or landscape plan, the Board may make a finding that the
design is inappropriate.
   (d)   In order to make a valid determination of excessively similar,
dissimilar or inappropriate design, the Board must also issue a finding or
findings, based upon the evidence in the record, that such similarity,
dissimilarity or inappropriateness will produce one of the harmful effects
identified in
Section 9(D)(4) of Article V of the Village Charter.
(Ord. 2000-17. Passed 6-7-00.)
1335.06 INSPECTION.
   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for making inspections
sufficient to enforce this code. In the event the Building Inspector determines
it is necessary to obtain professional assistance in determining whether or not
a building or structure is being constructed in accordance with the terms of
the permit issued hereunder, he shall, at the direction of the Mayor, have the
authority to engage the services of a professional architect to provide such
assistance.
(Ord. 2000-17. Passed 6-7-00.)
1335.07 SMALL CELL/TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Guidelines. The Architectural Board of Review shall enact and revise
Design Guidelines for "small cell facilities," as that term is defined in
Section 4939.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, and the accessory equipment, which
are to be located anywhere in the Village, whether in a right of way or
elsewhere. The authority to revise and modify the Design Guidelines shall cover
technological advances which may change the way wireless signals are broadcast
to consumers of wireless services. The Design Guidelines shall reasonably
regulate the location and design of "small cell facilities" and accessory
equipment so as to prevent the adverse impact of a location or design on a
property or the public, while not unreasonably interfering with the rapid
deployment of new telecommunications technologies. The current version of the
duly adopted Design Guidelines shall be kept in the office of the Building
Commissioner.
   (b)   Compliance. No person may erect a small cell facility, its accessory
equipment, or any similar telecommunication facility or equipment in the
Village without first obtaining the approval of the Architectural Board of
Review and a building permit. In considering the permit request, the
Architectural Board of Review shall reasonably apply the Design Guidelines to
achieve the objectives of this ordinance.
   (c)   Appeal. The administration of the Design Guidelines shall be subject
to the appeal provisions found in Section
1335.02 of the Codified Ordinances of Orange Village.
   (d)   Penalty. The failure to comply with the provisions of this Section,
the Design Guidelines promulgated by the Board and the decisions of the Board
in the administration of the Guidelines shall be subject to the penalties set
forth in Section
1335.99 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2018-30. Passed 8-8-18.)
1335.08 EXPIRATION OF APPROVAL.
   If, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date when the
Architectural Board of Review has granted design approval, no substantial work
is done in accordance with the terms and conditions for which such approval was
granted, or if the building permit for such work is expired and cannot be
administratively renewed by the Building Commissioner pursuant to Section
1325.06 of the Orange Village Codified Ordinances, the approval granted by the
Board shall expire. If the property owner or the owner’s representative files a
written request for an extension of the approval with the Building
Commissioner, the Architectural Board of Review shall consider the request and
may grant an extension for up to one additional year upon a finding that no
changes to the character of the neighborhood have occurred which would impact
the Board’s opinion regarding approval. Only one such extension may be granted
by the Architectural Board of Review. After the expiration of the approval
(including any extension thereof), the approval shall be deemed null and void,
and any future design approval shall be considered as if no prior approval had
ever been granted. The Building Commissioner shall advise the Secretary of the
Architectural Board of Review of the expiration of such approval, and the Clerk
shall enter such expiration upon the Board’s records. (Ord. 2019-24. Passed 11-
13-19.)
1335.09 NATURALIZED LANDSCAPING.
   The Architectural Board of Review shall adopt and maintain guidelines to
permit property owners to develop and maintain a “Naturalized Landscape”,
meaning a designed combination of plants, shrubs and trees that are intended to
grow with minimal maintenance on properties in the Village. Nothing in this
ordinance is intended to permit a Naturalized Landscape to be developed or
maintained in the Village in any development that has any condominium or
homeowners’ association which has not permitted Naturalized Landscapes.
(Ord. 2023-13. Passed 10-4-23.)
1335.99 PENALTY AND REMEDIES.
   (a)   Any owner of any building or premises or part thereof, who violates
the terms of this chapter, or any architect, builder or contractor who assists
in the commission of any such violation, or any person who fails to comply with
an order of the Architectural Board of Review, shall for each violation or
failure to comply, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree, which
shall be punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars and a jail sentence
of up to sixty days, or both. Each day such violation or failure to comply
exists shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)   In lieu of or in addition to the prosecution for any criminal
violation authorized by subsection (a) hereof, the Law Director, at the
direction of the Mayor, may institute an appropriate action or proceeding in a
court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful condition, to restrain,
correct or abate a violation; to prevent the occupancy of buildings, structures
or premises which violate this chapter; or to require compliance with this
chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, or the
orders of the Architectural Board of Review.

1365.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. Orange Village has special flood hazard areas that
are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which   serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Orange Village, as
identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by Orange Village.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
effective December 3, 2010, and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio
and Incorporated Areas, effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by Orange Village as required by Section
1365.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Hall at 4600 Lander Road, Orange Village,
Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by these regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes provided that where a provision of these regulations may be in
conflict with a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take
precedence over these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations do not create liability on the part
of Orange Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2010-
26. Passed 11-10-10.)

to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study" (FIS) means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation" (FPE) means the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" is any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change" (LOMC) means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park" means, as specified in Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes,
used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes,
and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program" (NFIP) means the Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Orange
Village Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 4, 1983, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" means and includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" or "Areas of Special Flood Hazard" means
the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 11-10-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Orange Village flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1365.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
 1365.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Orange
Village, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of Orange
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Orange Village
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the Orange Village boundaries,
included within such notification shall be a copy of a map of Orange Village
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the Orange Village has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1365.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (1)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1365.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Orange Village and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development In Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. hereof, items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Orange Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1365.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 11-10-10.)
1365.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeal Board Established.  
      (1)   The Orange Village Planning and Zoning Commission is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Village Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in Village
Hall at 4600 Lander Road, Orange Village, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof of
these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by Orange Village.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of ccess to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. - K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.    Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 11-10-
10.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1365.03(i).

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a third degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of Orange Village. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Orange
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or

1377.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Orange Village:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within
Orange Village to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected, and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize Orange Village’s future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1377.01.

and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; to meet the requirements of the
Construction General Permit; and to meet the following criteria:
       (1)   Integrated SCMs that address degradation of water resources. The
SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter
1176 Riparian Setbacks of the Orange Village Codified Ordinances.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable. Where feasible, bioretention, permeable
pavement with infiltration, underground storage with infiltration, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins, and/or rainwater harvesting must be the water
quality SCMs used. Separate SCMs may be used for peak discharge control and
water quality treatment.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by Orange Village and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1121, as well as pertinent provisions of the Orange Village Codified Ordinances
regulating subdivisions, shall provide stormwater management and water quality
controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include
provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during
the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-
development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1377.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1378 ‘Comprehensive Stormwater Management’ and Chapter
1176 Riparian Setbacks of the Orange Village Codified Ordnances, all as
determined by the Orange Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1377.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Orange Village Engineer
that the site is part of a larger common plan of development where the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by an existing
SCM, or if the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by
SCMs defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Orange Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by Orange Village.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by Orange Village, SCMs
serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership. SCMs serving single lots shall be
placed on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the
property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Such practices may include minimizing site grading and compaction; protecting
and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing vegetation and
vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in order to
minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices; and
maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
      (10)   Post-Construction Soil Restoration: Except for areas that will be
covered by impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil
moisture- holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be
restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer
removed should be amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria in
Rainwater and Land Development.
   
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey
stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The Orange Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
1377.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1378 Comprehensive Stormwater Management and Chapter
1176 Riparian Setbacks of the Orange Village Codified Ordinances, all as
determined by the Orange Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant’s development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities, or the stormwater
quality control facility shall be sized to treat the off-site flow.
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Orange Village Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. The sheet flow
length shall not exceed seventy-five (75) feet from impervious area or 150 feet
from pervious areas. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer,
or other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all
as determined by the Orange Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Orange Village
Engineer, drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with
vegetated banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff
from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Orange Village zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Orange Village
Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems
when necessary:
         A.   Uniform Standards for Sewerage Improvements, Latest Edition shall
be followed.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
systems is twelve (12) inches unless smaller is approved by the Orange Village
Engineer. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems, subject to the
approval of the Orange Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in Orange Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream’s flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm. However, a 50-
year or 100-year, 24-hour design may be required by the Orange Village
Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold-
water habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high-water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent (25%) of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
yearstorm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least two feet below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site’s storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by Orange Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill ifjustified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by Orange Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the Construction
General Permit. The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan shall describe how
the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following requirements for
stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre- development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Orange Village Engineer, the total volume
(acre-feet) of runoff from a 1 -year, 24-hour storm occurring on the
development drainage area before and after development. These calculations
shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps for both pre-developed and post-developed
conditions shall include area, curve number, and time of concentrations. Time
of concentration shall also show the flow path and the separation in flow type.
            4.   Use the Standard Rainfall Intensity — Duration Tables from the
Uniform Standards for Sewerage Improvements, Latest Edition for stormwater
design.
            5.   Use the SCS Type II rainfall distribution for all design
events with a recurrence interval greater than 1 year. Include lot coverage
assumptions used for full build out of the proposed condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.    Pre-development Curve Numbers — For wooded or brushy
areas, use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, 1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values.
For all other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture,
grassland, or range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.    Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction hydrologic soil groups from Rainwater and Land
Development unless the soil is amended using the soil profile restoration
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development. All undisturbed areas or
open space with amended soils shall be treated as “open space in good
condition.”
            7.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow, and channel flow.
               i.    Maximum sheet flow length is 100 feet.
               ii.    Use the appropriate “unpaved” velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer
Handbook Section 4 — Hydrology (NEH-4).
            8.   The volume reduction provided by runoff reduction SCMs may be
subtracted from the post-development stormwater volume. Volume reductions for
these SCMs may be demonstrated using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land
Development or a hydrologic model acceptable to the Orange Village Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in Section
1377.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              Storm Will be:

--                        10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       --                          100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-developrnent peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
   (d)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas: SCMs on
previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the Construction General
Permit.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When Orange Village determines that site constraints compromise the intent
of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The Orange
Village Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any
alternative action proposed.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
  
1377.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Orange Village Engineer for inspections
and maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by Orange Village prior to approval of a
final plat
and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Auditor and on all property
deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Orange Village Engineer, access
easements between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 15-
feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an
additional 15-footwide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to SCMs shall be restricted against the construction therein
of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may obstruct the free
flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and
against the changing of final grade from that described by the final grading
plan approved Orange Village. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a
maintenance easement may be removed by Orange Village at the property owners’
expense. (Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
Orange Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the Orange Village Engineer and
per the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed, and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan approved
by the Orange Village Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the Orange
Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if
he/she determines that the design was altered significantly from the approved
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the
location and dimensions, of such SCMs.
   (c)   A copy of the complete Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Inspection
and Maintenance Agreement as specified in Section
1377.08 must be provided to Orange Village..
      (Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. Orange Village has
the authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary,
with prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are
being maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding
a malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, Orange Village shall
provide written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the
Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon
notification, the responsible party shall have ten (10) working days, or other
mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed
action items and established timelines. Should repairs not be made within this
time, or a plan approved by the Orange Village Engineer for these repairs not
in place, Orange Village may undertake the necessary repairs and assess the
responsible party.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to Orange
Village before the review process begins. The Orange Village Engineer shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
 
1377.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil- disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash
bond of ten percent (10%) of the total project cost has been deposited with the
Orange Village Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for Orange Village
to perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less
Orange Village administrative fees, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   The site has been stabilized, temporary BMPs have been removed, and
the sediment settling basin has been converted to or replaced with post
construction SCM(s) and one of the following conditions are met:
         A.   One hundred percent (100%) of the total project has achieved
permanent stabilization.
         B.   Less than one (1) acre of lots remain unbuilt.
         C.   No development activities have occurred for one (1) year.
      (2)   An As-Built Certification of all SCMs is approved by the Orange
Village Engineer.
      (3)   An Tnspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by Orange
Village and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the
developer, the contractor, Orange Village, and the private owner or homeowners’
association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted
by Orange Village.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
Orange Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long-term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
 
1377.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Orange Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of
the final grade at the site, after all the utilities are installed, and the
site is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.
The developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Orange Village
Engineer to demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof
of compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must be
stabilized within two (2) days.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.17 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation or fail to comply with any of such provisions
or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made pursuant to this
regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any lands in
violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted under this
regulation. (Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.18 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by Orange Village in relation to this regulation may appeal
to the court of common pleas. Such an appeal shall be made in conformity with
Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2022-9. Passed 7-6-22.)
1377.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity, or corporation; including but not limited
to, the owner of the property, his agents and assigns, occupant, property
manager, and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to comply
with any provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree and shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or
imprisoned for no more than sixty (60) days, or both, for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude Orange Village from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in
a Court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to
restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the
provisions of this regulation or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or
regulations, or the orders of Orange Village.

      (7)    Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per
24- hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended, and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the BMP must be implemented within ten (10) days
from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)    Final Stabilization: Final stabilization is achieved when the site
has reached eighty percent (80%) cover and when the Orange Village Engineer
approves the site condition.

application does not require the construction of a new tower or associated
facilities. Any decision to deny a request to place, construct or modify a
wireless communication antenna and/or tower shall be in writing and supported
by substantial evidence contained in a written record of the proceedings of the
Commission.
   (c)   With the permit application to the Commission, the applicant shall
file a complete set of plans and specifications, a site plan showing the
location of the tower and uses and structures on the same and adjacent parcels,
and any other information deemed necessary by the Commission for a review of
the application. The applicant is also encouraged to provide photographs
showing structures and uses on adjacent parcels. The applicant shall also place
on deposit an amount necessary for the Village to obtain a certification from a
registered engineer(s) that the proposal is in compliance with all federal,
state and local regulations. As part of the permit application, the applicant
shall provide the Village with a list of competitors together with their
addresses so that the Village may notify the competitors of the application in
an effort to encourage collocation.
   (d)   Approval by the Commission of the granting of a permit shall become

Resolution of the Commission granting such permit shall be filed forthwith by
the Secretary of the Commission with the Clerk of Council. If, within the 30-
day period next succeeding such filing, Council by a majority vote disapproves
the Board's action in granting the permit, the permit shall be void and shall
not be issued, otherwise, it, together with any additional conditions imposed
by Council, becomes and is in full force and effect on the day next succeeding
the 30-day period. However, should Council approve the action of the Commission
within the 30-day period, the permit becomes in full force and effect from the

   Only the following types of wireless communication antenna and/or tower
installations may be permitted under this chapter:
   (a)   Wireless communication antenna attached to a permitted institutional,
recreational, public utility, office, industrial or commercial building or
structure provided the antenna does not exceed ten (10) feet above the highest
point of the structure and the transmission and receiving equipment, where
feasible, is stored inside the existing building or structure or on the roof in
an enclosure. The foregoing does not preclude the use of small PCS basic
stations and repeaters on the sides of buildings, utility poles or in ground
mounted pedestals.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 3-26-97.)
   (b)   Wireless communication monopole or lattice tower constructed up to,
but not including, two hundred feet (200') in height, unless a lesser height is
technically feasible to service the geographical service area of the applicant
and the transmission and receiving equipment is stored inside a building

have sufficient structural capacity to allow for two (2) providers to be
located on the structure when constructed to the maximum allowable height.
      (Ord. 2007-17. Passed 8-8-07.)
1381.06 STANDARDS.
   The Commission shall consider, and the applicant shall demonstrate,
compliance with the following standards in determining whether to approve an
application for a wireless communication tower:
   (a)   There is no technically suitable space reasonably available on an
existing tower or structure within the geographic area to be served. With the
permit application, the applicant shall list the location of every tower,
building or structure that could support the proposed antenna so as to allow it
to serve its intended function. The applicant must demonstrate that a
technically suitable location is not reasonably available on an existing tower,
building or structure. If another communication tower is technically suitable,
the applicant must show that it has requested to co-locate on the existing
tower and the co-location request was rejected by the owner of the tower. If
another communication tower is technically suitable, the applicant must further
show that it has offered to allow the owner of that other tower to co-locate an
antenna on another tower within the Village owned by the applicant on
reciprocal terms and the offer was not accepted. In all cases, the Village
shall use its best efforts to encourage co-location.
   (b)   Poles, towers, equipment structures and antenna placement shall meet
the minimum yard setback requirements as set forth in the Zoning Code for the
Zoning District in which the antenna and/or tower is proposed to be located and
all lot area requirements for that Zoning District.
   (c)   Screen fencing shall be provided for aesthetic and public safety
reasons. A fence at least six feet in height will be erected completely around
the communication tower and any related support facilities. Barbed wire at the
top of the fence is permitted.
   (d)   Towers and antenna shall be designed to withstand wind gusts of at
least 100 miles an hour.
   (e)   A landscaped buffer area of not less than ten feet in depth shall be
placed between the wireless communication facilities and the public rights-of-
way, residential Zoning Districts and any adjacent residential uses. The ten-
foot landscape buffer shall consist of a tight screen fence of hardy evergreen
shrubbery not less than six feet in height. The landscaping shall be
continuously maintained and promptly restored, if necessary.
   (f)   Outdoor storage of any supplies, vehicles or equipment related to the
use of the facility is prohibited.
   (g)   Except as required by law, an antenna or a tower shall not be
illuminated and lighting fixtures or signs shall not be attached to the antenna
or tower. If lighting is required by FAA regulations, white strobe lights shall
not be permitted at night unless no other less bothersome, annoying and
disturbing alternative is permitted by the FAA. Lighting for security purposes
shall be permitted at the wireless telecommunication facility with a prior
approval of the Commission and Council.
   (h)   The applicant must provide written certification from a registered
engineer that the antenna and/or tower are to be constructed in compliance with
all applicable federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the
construction.
   (i)   A proposed new tower in an non-residential district shall not be
located within 1,000 feet from any residential zoning district, or from any
residentially used property.
   (j)   There shall be a separation of at least one quarter mile between new
wireless communications towers. The Commission may waive this requirement for
wireless communication towers associated with or within existing structures
such as electrical high-tension towers.
   (k)   No advertising shall be permitted on the wireless telecommunication
facility.

   Wireless communication antennas and/or towers located on Village-owned
property, by permission of the Village Council, shall be exempt from the
regulations set forth in this chapter and any other provisions of the Zoning
Code.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 3-26-97.)
1381.09 ABANDONMENT.
   All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the Commission
notifying them of any tower facility located in the municipality whose use will
be discontinued and the date this use will cease. If at any time the use of the
facility is discontinued for 180 days, the Commission may declare the facility
abandoned. (This excludes any dormancy period between construction and the
initial use of the facility.) The facility's owner/operator will receive
written notice from the Commission and shall be instructed to either reactivate
the facility's use within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If
reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the municipality will remove or
will contract to have removed the facility and assess the owner/operator the
costs.

   It is the intent of Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and gas
wells within the Municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted
to supplement any State issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil
and gas well within the Municipality. The provisions of this chapter are based
upon local conditions which may not be known to the State at the time such
drilling was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the Municipality to
exercise its local police authority, authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the
protection of the Municipality's residents and all emergency personnel who may
be called upon to respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 8-10-05.)
1521.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 8-10-05.)
1521.03 MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas (“Permit Holder”)
within Orange Village, which permit has been issued by the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources (“ODNR”), shall adhere to the following regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the permit issued by ODNR shall be filed with the Fire Chief
not less than ten (10) days before the commencement of any operations
preparatory to drilling in the Village. Upon receipt by the Chief, a copy of
such permit shall be delivered by the Fire Department to all owners and/or
occupants of all properties which adjoin the property where a well is to be
drilled.
   (b)    With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Fire Chief
which identifies the owner(s) of the subject property where the well is to be
drilled by name and address, and identifies all persons, including but not
limited to the Permit Holder, who are responsible for the drilling and
operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a minimum, names,
mailing addresses and work telephone numbers.
   (c)   Plans for all wells, tank batteries, all excavation work (including
but not limited to boring pits) and all other site work shall be presented to
the Fire Chief not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of any
drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of the site
and of all vehicular access to the site from any public right of way.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred feet (500) of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g. fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g. a playground) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure, or facilities, or occupants, or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Fire Chief, prior to the
commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the Permit

Ohio, with limits of Three million dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence for
personal injury and property damage.
   (h)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Fire Chief prior to the commencement
of drilling. Such information shall be immediately updated upon any change of
circumstance.
   (i)   In accordance with Ohio law, the Permit Holder shall do all of the
following:

property; and
      (2)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of

      (3)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover, and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (4)   Notify the Building Commissioner that the site has been restored
pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. The Building Commissioner shall
inspect the site within five (5) days of the notification to ensure that no
grading of the property has occurred which materially alters the drainage of
the subject property in a manner which is inconsistent with the drainage of the
property prior to the commencement of any ground moving activities performed
pursuant to the ODNR permit.
   (j)    At all times relative to the drilling, operation and plugging of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from access to the
greatest extent possible, in a manner consistent with ODNR regulations.
   (k)   Within six (6) months after the drilling operations have been
completed, the Permit Holder shall plant sufficient vegetation which, in
conjunction with any fencing and natural vegetation, shall effectively and
permanently screen all above-ground facilities from all neighbors and from all
public and private rights of way, while such facilities are on the subject
premises. The Building Commissioner shall determine the sufficiency of the
screening and may order the Permit Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Fire Chief at least forty-eight (48)
hours notice before commencing to drill.
   (m)   The Permit Holder shall file a cash bond with the Building
Commissioner in accordance with the following provisions.
      (1)   A cash bond of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per well shall be
filed with the Building Commissioner to ensure the installation and maintenance
of sufficient fencing and screening of facilities, as provided herein, and also
to secure the repair or replacement of any Village owned infrastructure (e.g.
roads and culverts) which may be damaged by any activity related to oil and gas
production, including but not limited to the transportation of equipment or
materials used in any manner for oil and gas production, or for the plugging of
a well.
      (2)   No Permit Holder shall be required to file more than four (4) cash
bonds, totaling twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), which shall be deemed to be
a “blanket bond” for all additional wells drilled in the Village.
      (3)   Fencing and screening shall be installed and maintained in a manner
which accomplishes the intended goal of screening and securing the facilities.
      (4)   In the event the Village is required to utilize the bond to
install, maintain or repair the facilities which are secured by said bond, the
Permit Holder shall file with the Village sufficient funds to restore the bond
to its original amount.
      (5)   Any bond filed with the Village shall be held until such time as
all equipment has been removed from the site of the oil and gas production
facilities, the well is plugged and the site has been appropriately restored,
as required by state law. The Municipality shall return the bond upon the
restoration of the site, upon the determination by the Building Commissioner
that the interests to be secured by the bond are no longer at risk.
   (n)   Notwithstanding Section
509.08 of these Codified Ordinances, drilling operations may occur twenty-four
hours per day until the permitted depth is reached.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the state issued permit, or any state statute or
ODNR regulation.
   (p)   The Fire Chief or his designee shall, within two (2) business days of
receipt of the plans pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, review said plans and
immediately advise the Permit Holder if anything shown on the plans does not
comply with the regulations set forth herein.
   (q)   In the event that any Permit Holder fails to comply with the
regulations herein promulgated, the administrative official responsible for the
enforcement hereof (i.e. the Building Commissioner or Fire Chief, as designated
herein), shall provide written notice to the owner of the property and the
Permit Holder within forty-eight (48) hours of the discovery of such failure to
comply. Such service shall be made to the addresses identified in paragraph (b)
hereof, and if no address has been provided, to any address identified on the
permit issued by the State of Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the
Permit Holder that if they wish to appeal the decision of the administrative
official, the time for appeal is five (5) days after service of the notice.
   (r)   The Permit Holder shall report to the Fire Chief any incidents or
emergencies relating to the wellhead, tank battery and/or the site of drilling
operations. The report shall be a detailed written report and filed with the
Fire Chief no later than forty-eight (48) hours after an incident or emergency
begins.
   (s)   The Permit Holder shall provide an employee/contractor (“Pumper”) who
is responsible for the oil and gas well. The Pumper shall be qualified to
manage well operations and shall be responsible for maintaining the well. The
Pumper shall take whatever action or actions are necessary to mitigate any
hazardous condition.
   (t)   Upon receiving notice that a safety issue has been detected at the
Permit Holder’s well, the Permit Holder or its Pumper shall respond at the well
site. The maximum acceptable response time, established by the Fire Chief, is
thirty (30) minutes. Response time is defined as the elapsed time between
notification to the Permit Holder that a safety issue exists and the Permit
Holder or Pumper’s arrival at the well site. The Permit Holder emergency
contact information required by division (h) of this section shall be utilized
to provide notification. In the event a safety issue is detected, the Fire
Department has authority to shut down the well.
   (u)   Consistent with Ohio Revised Code Section 3737.80, the Fire Chief in
an emergency situation is responsible for primary coordination of on scene
activities.
   (v)   The Permit Holder shall install “hold-open” latches on all wellhead
and tank battery enclosures.
   (w)   Consistent with Ohio Revised Code Section 3737.14, the Permit Holder
shall grant a “Right of Entry” to the Fire Department, at all reasonable hours
to enter into all buildings and upon all premises and vehicles used in
connection with oil and gas well drilling for the purpose of examination.
