ORDINANCE RECORD
COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF BROOKLYN HEIGHTS
Ordinance No.  101-99   
By  Stankiewicz    
AN EMERGENCY ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF
BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, OHIO, 1999; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT
THEREWITH; TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND TO PUBLISH THE
ENACTMENT OF SUCH NEW MATTER.
   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the legislation of the Village before it for some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is now
before the Council.
   THE VILLAGE OF BROOKLYN HEIGHTS HEREBY ORDAINS THAT:
   Section 1. The ordinances and resolutions of the Village of Brooklyn
Heights, Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified,
arranged and consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections,
are hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Brooklyn
Heights, Ohio, 1999.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk/Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Brooklyn Heights, Ohio.
   6
   Section 2. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof that are in
conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
         (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement
or privilege;
         (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
         (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or
guarantee of payment;
         (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
         (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
         (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
         (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way;
         (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
         (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
   (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to December 31, 1998.
   Section 3. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, the Clerk/Treasurer shall publish,
in a manner required by law, a notice of the enactment of this ordinance,
containing the title of this ordinance, together with a summary of the new
matter contained in the Codified Ordinances hereby adopted, a copy of which
summary is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
   Section 4. All sections and subsections in the Codified Ordinances of
Brooklyn Heights without an ordinance or resolution history, or with the words
"Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof, are or contain new matter in the
Codified Ordinances, said new matter having been found to be necessary, in the
course of preparing the Codified Ordinances, to render the legislation of the
Village internally consistent, consistent with local and current conditions,
practices and procedures, and consistent with State law, where and as required
by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, as well as to adopt the
latest editions of technical codes adopted by the Village by reference, and
said new matter is hereby approved, adopted and enacted. A summary of such new
matter is attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A and the same shall be
published, together with notice of the adoption of this ordinance, as
aforesaid, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23.
6A
   Section 5. This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and
welfare of the Village of Brooklyn Heights. The reason for this emergency is
the immediate need to have an accurate and current codification of the
legislation of the Village, one which is consistent with current State law, as
required by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, with which to
administer the affairs of the Village, assure law and order and avoid practical
and legal entanglements. As such, this ordinance, and the Codified Ordinances
of Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, 1999, hereby approved, adopted and enacted, shall go
into effect immediately.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Section 1.05.   Ethical Conduct and Conflicts of Interest.
   The standards of ethical conduct and avoidance of conflicts of interest for

the purpose of discussing closed or executive sessions, limited to its own
membership, the Mayor, Clerk/Treasurer, Law Director and any other executive
officer the Council deems necessary to accomplish the purpose of the closed or
executive session, any matter which would tend to defame or prejudice the

the agenda.

in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it
shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after
the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and
describing it in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be
adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is
introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least five (5) Council members shall
be required for adoption. After its adoption the ordinance shall be published
and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It shall become
effective upon adoption or at the time specified in the ordinance. An emergency
ordinance may be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same
manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.
(Nov. 4, 1997)
Section 2.12.   Codes of Technical Regulations.
   The Village Council may adopt any standard code of technical regulations by
reference thereto in an adopting ordinance. The procedure and requirements
governing such an adopting ordinance shall be as prescribed for ordinances
generally, except that: (1) the requirements of Section 2.10 for the
distribution and filing of copies of the ordinance shall be construed to
include copies of the code of technical regulations as well as of the adopting
ordinance; and (2) a copy of each adopted code of technical regulations as well

Clerk pursuant to Section 2.13(a). Copies of any adopted code of technical
regulations shall be made available by the Village Clerk for distribution or

preparation of a general codification of all Village ordinances and resolutions
having the force and effect of law. The general codification shall be adopted
by the Council by ordinance and shall be published promptly in bound or loose-
leaf form. The general codification, together with this Charter and any
amendments thereto, pertinent provisions of the Constitution and other laws of
the State of Ohio, and such codes of technical regulations and other rules and
regulations as the Council may specify, shall be available for public
inspection and purchase at the Village Municipal Center and other locations as
specified by the Council. This compilation shall be known and cited officially
as the Village of Brooklyn Heights Code. Copies of the Code shall be furnished
to Village officers, placed in libraries and public offices for free public
reference and made available for purchase by the public at a reasonable price
fixed by the Council.
   (c)   Printing. The Village Council shall cause each ordinance and
resolution having the force and effect of law and each amendment to this
Charter to be printed promptly following its adoption, and the printed
ordinances, resolutions and Charter amendments shall be distributed or sold to
the public at reasonable prices as fixed by the Council. Following publication
of the first Village of Brooklyn Heights Code and at all times thereafter, the
ordinances, resolutions and Charter amendments shall be printed in
substantially the same style as the Code currently in effect and shall be
suitable in form for integration therein. The Council shall make such further
arrangements as it deems desirable with respect to reproduction and
distribution of any current changes in or additions to the provisions of the
Constitution and other laws of the State of Ohio, or the codes of technical
regulations and other rules and regulations included in the Code.

Section 8.05.   Removal and Recall of Elected Officials.
   (1)   The remedies contained in this Charter for the removal of elected
officials shall be the sole and exclusive remedies.
   (2)   Any elected official of the Village may be removed from office by the
qualified voters of the Village. The removal procedure shall be as follows: (a)
Petition. A petition signed by at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total
votes cast at the last preceding regular general election, and demanding the
election of a successor to the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with
the Board of Elections. The petition shall contain a general statement in not
more than two hundred (200) words specifying the grounds upon which the removal
of an elected official is sought; (b) Election. If the petition is sufficient,
and if the person whose removal is sought does not resign within five (5) days
after the sufficiency of the petition has been determined, the Village Council
shall thereupon order and fix a day for the holding of an election to determine
the question of his or her removal, and for the selection of a successor to
each officer named in the petition. Such election shall be held not less than
ninety (90) nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the time of the
determination of the sufficiency of the petition. The election authorities
shall publish notice and make all arrangements for holding such election, which
shall be conducted and the result returned and declared in all respects as are
the results of regular Village elections; (c) Nomination of Successors. Any
candidates seeking to succeed such officer(s) shall file candidacy petitions
with the election authorities no later than ninety (90) days prior to the
special recall election, a petition proposing a person for each office whose
holder's removal is sought, signed by electors equal in number to five percent
(5%) of the total votes cast in the last preceding regular general election;
(d) Ballot Wording and Voting. The ballots at the recall election shall, with
respect to each person whose removal is sought, submit the question: “Shall
[name of person] be removed from the office of [name of office] by recall?”
Immediately after each question above, the following two (2) propositions shall
be printed on the ballots in this order: “For the recall of [name of officer].”
“Against the recall of [name of officer].” Immediately to the left of the
proposition shall be placed a square in which the voters, by making an
appropriate mark, may vote for one (1) of the propositions. The names of
candidates to fill the vacancy shall be listed after each set of propositions.
The officer whose removal is sought cannot be a candidate in the election. In a
recall election, if a majority of the votes cast on the question of removal are
affirmative, the officer whose removal is sought shall be removed from office
upon the announcement of the official canvass of that election, and the
candidate receiving the plurality of the votes cast for candidates for that
office shall be declared elected. The candidate who is elected shall hold the
office for the unexpired term of the officer who was removed; and (e) Timing
and Expenses. No removal of any officer can be submitted to the voters until
the officer has served at least one (1) year. If, at any recall election, the
officer whose removal is sought is not recalled, he or she shall be repaid his
or her actual and legitimate expenses incurred during the recall election from
the Treasury of the Village, up to fifty percent (50%) of what the candidate
could have spent in a regular Village election, but not to exceed five hundred
dollars ($500.00).

202.06   CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the
Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind
required to be in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the
Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting a provision of these Codified Ordinances, it is presumed
that:
      (1)   Compliance with the Constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire provision is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   A provision of these Codified Ordinances is presumed to be prospective
in its operation unless it is expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If a provision of these Codified Ordinances is ambiguous, the court,
in determining the intention of Council, may consider, among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which provision was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction; and
      (6)   The administrative construction of the provision.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable. (ORC 1.50)
202.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall be fined not more than one hundred and fifty
dollars ($150.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues, unless otherwise provided.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observances throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt an entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

notification of special meetings of a municipal body shall file with the Clerk/
Treasurer a written request therefor.
   Except in the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action as
set forth in subsection (d) hereof, a special meeting shall not be held unless
at least twenty-four hours advance notice of the time, place and purposes of
such special meeting is given to the news media that have requested such
advance notification in accordance with subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   News media requests for such advance notification of special meetings
shall specify the municipal body that is the subject of such request; the name
of the medium; the name and address of the person to whom written notification
to the medium may be mailed, telegraphed or delivered; the names, addresses and

from such medium canceling or modifying such request, whichever is earlier.
Each requesting news medium shall be informed of such period of effectiveness
at the time it files its request. Such requests may be modified or extended
only by filing a complete new request with the Clerk/Treasurer. A request shall

request may be conclusively relied on by the Village, the municipal body that
is the subject of such request, and the Clerk/Treasurer.
   (c)   The Clerk/Treasurer shall give such oral notification or written
notification, or both, as the Clerk/Treasurer determines, to the news media

hereof, of the time, place and purpose of each special meeting, at least
twenty-four hours prior to the time of such special meeting.
   (d)   In the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action, a

notification thereof to the requesting news media. The persons calling such
meeting, or any one or more of such persons, or the Clerk/Treasurer on their
behalf, shall immediately give oral notification or written notification, or
both, as the person or persons giving such notification determine, of the time
and place and purpose of such special meeting, to such news media that have

   (c)   Each such written request must be accompanied by cash or a check or
money order payable to the Village, in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) for
each month covered by the request, which amount has been determined by the
Council to represent a reasonable fee to cover costs of providing such advance
notification.
(Ord. 96-75. Passed 1-20-76.)

relied on by the Village, the municipal body that is the subject of such
request, and the Clerk/Treasurer.

this section by written notification. If such written notification cannot be
given or has not been given, the Clerk/Treasurer shall give oral notification.

agendas, of all meetings of the municipal body that is the subject of such
request.

258.05   APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. This section is adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
737.16 for the purpose of providing for competitive examinations to ascertain
the merit and fitness of applicants for appointment and promotion in the Police
Department. This section authorizes Council to establish criteria for age,
residency and other requirements for such appointments and promotions. (1974
Code § 35.01)
   (b)   Compliance Required. No person shall be appointed or promoted in the
Police Department in any manner or by any means other than those prescribed in
this section, excepting, however, the Village Marshal (Chief of Police). (1974
Code § 35.02)
   (c)   Competitive Examinations.
      (1)   When there is a vacancy, or a vacancy appears imminent, in any rank
in the Police Department, the Mayor, with the approval of Council, shall select
an outside agency to conduct a competitive examination for all applicants for
the position to be filled. Such examinations shall be practical in character,
shall be written or written and oral, and shall relate directly to those
matters which fairly test the capacity of the person examined to discharge the
particular duties of the position for which the appointment is to be made.
Reasonable notice of the time, place and general scope of the competitive
examination for appointment or promotion shall be given by the Mayor. Such
notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place in the Village Hall and in
the Police Department at least two weeks prior to the examination.
      (2)   Prior to taking the competitive examination for a new applicant to
the Police Department, an applicant shall take and pass an examination which
fairly tests the ability of the person examined to physically perform the
particular duties of the position for which the appointment is to be made.
Prior to appointment to a vacancy in the Police Department, an applicant shall
take and pass an examination which fairly tests the ability of the person
examined to mentally perform the duties of the position for which the
appointment is to be made. A medical officer shall establish the mental
standards for qualification and shall be the sole judge as to whether or not an
applicant meets these standards.
      (3)   If there is only one applicant for a promotion in the Police
Department, the written examination shall be dispensed with and the applicant
shall be appointed to the position to be filled, if otherwise qualified.
(1974 Code § 35.03)
   (d)   Applications.
      (1)   Each applicant seeking a promotion in the Police Department shall
file with the Mayor, within the period allowed in the announcement, a formal
application in which the applicant shall state under oath or affirmation as
follows:
         A.   His or her full name, residence and post office address;
         B.   His or her age, place of birth and date of birth;
         C.   His or her business employment and residence for the previous
five years; and
         D.   Such other information as may reasonably be required pertaining
to the applicant's fitness for the position sought.
         Any downloads of documents after closing, the candidate does not
receive credit for bonus and disqualifies candidate if required documentation.
      (2)   The Mayor, with the approval of Council, may refuse to allow an
applicant to be examined, or, after an examination, refuse to consider an
applicant for the position, who is found to lack any of the established
preliminary requirements for the examination; who is physically so disabled as
to be unfit for the performance of the duties of the position to be filled; who
is addicted to the habitual use of intoxicating liquor or drugs to excess; who
has been convicted of a felony; who has been guilty of infamous or notoriously
disgraceful conduct; who has been dismissed from any public position for
delinquency or misconduct; or who has made false statements of any material
fact or practiced or attempted to practice any deception of fraud in the
applicant's application or in the applicant's examination in establishing the
applicant's eligibility or securing the applicant's appointment.
      (3)   No person shall be eligible to take an examination for an original
appointment as a police officer unless he or she is at least twenty-one years
of age, but not more than thirty-five years of age at the time of the
examination, however, there is a five year extension (forty years of age
maximum) granted for applicants who have service credit verified in one of the
three qualified Ohio law enforcement pension systems OP&F, PERS-LE, and/or
HPRS), a high school graduate, a natural born or naturalized citizen of the
United States. (1974 Code §35.04)
   (e)   Eligible Lists and Preferences.
      (1)   From the returns of the examination, the examiners shall prepare an
eligible list of the persons who have passed the examination and are regarded
as eligible for the position, and such persons shall be ranked upon the list as
candidates in the order of their relative excellence as determined by the
examination. In the event two or more applicants receive the same mark on a
promotional examination, seniority shall determine the order in which their
names shall be placed on the eligible list. For promotions, the term of
eligibility on promotion list shall be two years. For initial appointment to
the police department, an eligibility list expires upon the filling or closing
of the position(s). An expired eligible list may be used to fill a position of
the same classification within the same appointing authority for which the list
was created. In no event shall an expired list be used more than one year past
its expiration date. Such list shall be published by posting at the Village
Hall and a copy shall be furnished to the Clerk/Treasurer, as well as the
appointing authority.
      (2)   The first ten candidates on the eligibility list shall then be
given an interview by the appointing authority. The appointing authority may
then appoint one of the first ten candidates from the eligibility list.
            Should a candidate refuse, for any reason, to accept appointment to
the Police Department when first offered such an appointment by the Mayor, said
candidate's name shall be removed from the eligible list and said candidate
shall be ineligible to be reinstated on said list. After the expiration of said
eligible list, the candidate shall be eligible to reapply to take the
competitive examination for initial appointment in the Police Department.
      (3)   Upon being passed over for the third time, an applicant's name
shall be dropped from the list, but he or she may re-apply at a later date. An
eligibility list shall expire two years after its first date of publication.
      (4)   In the case of promotional examinations, an additional credit of
one-half point per year shall be allowed for seniority from five to twenty-five
years of service, with a maximum credit allowable of ten points.
      (5)   An additional credit of four percent shall be given to all
applicants for initial appointment for military service in the United States
Armed Forces, upon presentation of an honorable discharge form from such
service. No document other than an honorable discharge form shall be regarded
as proof of such service entitling the applicant to the four percent credit.
The military credit shall not be added unless a passing grade is obtained.

   (f)   Qualifications of New Members.
      (1)   Any member receiving an initial appointment as a member of the

one years of age when placed on the eligible list. He or she shall be a high

(c) hereof, which report shall show the applicant to be physically and mentally
fit to perform his or her duties as a member of the Police Department . (1974
Code §35.06)
   (g)   Vacancies; Eligibility for Promotions. In the case of a vacancy in the
supervisory ranks in the Police Department, the officer taking the test for
such position must have at least five or more continuous years of service at
the time of taking the examination. (1974 Code §35.07)
   (h)   Probationary Periods. All initial appointments to any position in the
Police Department, with the exception of the Police Chief, shall be for a
probationary period of one year, and all promotional appointments shall be for
a probationary period of six months. No initial appointment or promotion shall
be deemed final until the appointee has satisfactorily served the probationary
period. At the end of the probationary period, the Chief of Police shall
transmit to the Mayor a record of the employee's service, together with a
recommendation as to whether or not the employee has satisfactorily served the
probationary period. If such service is satisfactory, the appointee shall
continue in his or her rank. If, at the end of the probationary period, the
appointee's service is deemed unsatisfactory by the Mayor, the appointee shall
be terminated from the Police Department if the appointee had received an
initial appointment in the Police Department, or the appointee shall be reduced
to the rank held at the time he or she was appointed to the higher rank if the
appointee received a promotional appointment. In all cases of unsatisfactory

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
         Chap.
298.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 298
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Brooklyn Heights
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Brooklyn Heights ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes
involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within
the corporate limits of Brooklyn Heights, subject to the limitations of Ohio
R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor
shall be governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Parma Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Brooklyn Heights ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does
not exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section 434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in

   (b)   A portion of the court costs, in an amount not to exceed the maximum
set by Ohio R.C. 1901.261(A), shall be designated as the Mayor’s Court computer

required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of

(R.C. §4549.081(B))
414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.

432.01   DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two- way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a
left turn into or from an alley, private road, or driveway.
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.25(A) - (D))
432.02   PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   (a)   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass
each other to the right, and upon roadways having width for not more than one
line of traffic in each direction, each operator shall give to the other one-
half of the main traveled portion of the roadway or as nearly one-half as is
reasonably possible.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.

      (1)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in
the same direction shall, except as provided in division (c) of this section,
signal to the vehicle to be overtaken, shall pass to the left thereof at a safe
distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until
safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. When a motor vehicle overtakes and
passes a bicycle or electric bicycle, three feet or greater is considered a
safe passing distance.
      (2)   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle at the latter's audible signal, and the operator shall not
increase the speed of the operator's vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.
      (3)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction on a divided highway as defined in R.C. §
4511.35, a limited access highway as defined in R.C. § 5511.02, or a highway
with four or more traffic lanes is not required to signal audibly to the

      (1)   When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
or
      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled
by the overtaking vehicle.
   (b)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle only
under conditions permitting the movement in safety. The movement shall not be
made by driving off the roadway.

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.28)
432.05   OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT OF CENTERLINE.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless the
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.29)
432.06   DRIVING UPON LEFT SIDE OF ROADWAY.

following conditions:
      (1)   When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve in the
highway, where the operator's view is obstructed within such a distance as to
create a hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing.
   (b)   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a
roadway where traffic is lawfully directed to be driven to the left side, or
under the conditions described in R.C. § 4511.25(A)(2) or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,

4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.30)
432.07   HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   The Department of Transportation may determine those portions of any
State highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left
of the center or center line of the roadway would be especially hazardous, and
may, by appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate the beginning
and end of such zones. When signs or markings are in place and clearly visible,
every operator of a vehicle shall obey the directions of the signs or markings,
notwithstanding the distances set out in R.C. § 4511.30.
   (b)   Division (a) of this section does not apply when all of the following
apply:
      (1)   The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed of the

vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
R.C. § 4511.29, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.31)
432.08   DRIVING WITHIN LANES OR CONTINUOUS LINES OF TRAFFIC.
   (a)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked
lanes for traffic, or wherever within the Municipality traffic is lawfully
moving in two or more substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the
following rules apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from the lane or
line until the driver has first ascertained that the movement can be made with
safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center
lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is
clearly visible and the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance,
or when preparing for a left turn, or where the center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding, and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic-control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway, and drivers of vehicles shall obey
the directions of every such device.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.33)
432.09   FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY.
   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more
closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of the
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   (b)   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle,
when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district, shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between the vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
the space without danger. This division (b) does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
   (c)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade shall maintain a sufficient space
between the vehicles so an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy the space
without danger. This division shall not apply to funeral processions.

as practicable to the right- hand curb or edge of the roadway.
      (2)   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of the center line where it
enters the intersection, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn
shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line
of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made
in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of the
vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so
as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left hand lane
of the roadway being entered lawfully available to traffic moving in that lane.
   (b)   The Department of Transportation and local authorities may cause
markers, buttons, or signs to be placed within or adjacent to intersections,
and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in
this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection, and when
markers, buttons, or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle shall turn
the vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required by the
markers, buttons, or signs.

   (d)   Any stop or turn signal required by this section shall be given either
by means of the hand and arm, or by signal lights that clearly indicate to both
approaching and following traffic the intention to turn or move right or left,
except that any motor vehicle in use on a highway shall be equipped with, and
the required signal shall be given by, signal lights when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body,
cab or load of such motor vehicle exceeds 24 inches, or when the distance from
the center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body or
load thereof exceeds 14 feet, whether a single vehicle or a combination of
vehicles.
   (e)   The signal lights required by this section shall not be flashed on one
side only on a disabled vehicle, flashed as a courtesy or “do pass” signal to
operators of other vehicles approaching from the rear, nor be flashed on one
side only of a parked vehicle except as may be necessary for compliance with
this section.
   (f)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1) D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol a controlled
substance, or metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H. or (a)(1)I. or (b)
(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (4) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a laboratory report from
any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the Department of Health
authorizing an analysis as described in this division that contains an analysis
of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily
substance tested and that contains all of the information specified in this
division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the information and
statements that the report contains. The laboratory report shall contain all of
the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.

      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle, streetcar or trackless trolley upon a highway or any public or private
property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
Municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle, streetcar, or
trackless trolley shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or
tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine to
determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite, or
combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this
section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in

officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.

or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that

of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.

local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most
appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on

the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.

            3.   It is located outside the limits of a municipal corporation.
            4.   A majority of the total number of students enrolled at the
school are not related by blood.
            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

Transportation under Ohio R.C. 5501.27. The failure to erect signs of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 in a particular construction zone in accordance
with those guidelines and design specifications does not limit or affect the
application of division (a)(1), (a)(2)A., (a)(3)A., or (a)(4) of this section
in that construction zone or the prosecution of any person who violates any of
those divisions in that construction zone.

or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the holder must be accompanied by the

license pleads guilty to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court
of having committed the moving violation, the holder has not attained the age
of 16.5 years, during the six-month period commencing on that date;
            2.   If, on the date the holder pleads guilty to, is convicted of,

under division (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for occupational or educational driving privileges
without being accompanied by the holder’s parent or guardian during the period
of time specified in that division. The court may grant the person such driving
privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the restrictions
established in division (c)(1) will seriously affect the person’s ability to
continue in employment or educational training or will cause undue hardship on
the license holder or a family member of the license holder. In granting the
driving privileges, the court shall specify the purposes, times and places of
the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate forms setting forth the
privileges granted. Occupational or educational driving privileges under this
division shall not be granted to the same person more than once. If a person is

of age under proof of hardship satisfactory to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
or (b)(2) of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of
division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16,

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in R.C. § 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated

or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.

this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was

violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject

counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this Traffic Code
described in division (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or
electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation, or summons by a law

operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a

452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Impounding Abandoned Motor Vehicle on Public Property; Notice;
Disposition.
      (1)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or
Chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
         A.   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
         B.   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
            1.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C.
§ 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol
trooper shall allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to
arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified
by the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper. If the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper determines that the
vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the Sheriff,
Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
         C.   Subject to division (a)(3) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief
of Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.
      (2)   If the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper
issues an order under division (a)(1) of this section and arranges for the
removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing service shall
deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the Sheriff or Chief of
Police not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
      (3)   A.   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to
ascertain the identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle
ordered into storage by the Sheriff or Chief of Police, or by a state highway
patrol trooper within five business days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon
obtaining such identity, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
         B.   1.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
               a.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
               b.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would
endanger the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of
liability.
            2.   For purposes of division (a)(3)B. of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
         C.   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after
a search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
      (4)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle
within ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
      (5)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives
an affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section,
the dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of
title to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the
vehicle is dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are
delivered to the Clerk of Courts.
      (6)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with
this section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (b)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72 hours without
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (b), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. § 4513.60, 4513.61 and
4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
(R.C. § 4513.64(A))
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in
disposing of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.
452.06   PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW- AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of any person
adversely affected, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or
place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of
storage for a longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor
vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the Sheriff or Chief of Police
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is

deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force,
natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff and Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor
vehicles that the Sheriff or Chief of Police orders into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall include an entry for each
such motor vehicle that identifies the motor vehicle’s license number, make,
model, and color, the location from which it was removed, the date and time of
its removal, the telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered,
and the address of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may
be recovered. The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall provide any information in
the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any person who,
either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner
or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining to its
location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Sheriff’s or Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor
vehicle under division (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the
law enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person
who identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff or Chief of Police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private

   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the

culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
606.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
606.09   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13   SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

(ORC 2921.21)
608.04   FAILURE TO REPORT A CRIME OR DEATH.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in division (a)(2) of this section, no
person, knowing that a felony has been or is being committed, shall knowingly
fail to report the information to law enforcement authorities.
      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of R.C. § 2913.04(B) has been
or is being committed or that the person has received information derived from
such a violation, shall knowingly fail to report the violation to law
enforcement authorities.

wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or
her knowledge that may have a bearing on the investigation of the death.
   (e)   (1)   As used in this section, “burn injury” means any of the
following:
         A.   Second or third degree burns;
         B.   Any burns to the upper respiratory tract or laryngeal edema due
to the inhalation of super-heated air;
         C.   Any burn injury or wound that may result in death.
      (2)   No physician, nurse, physician assistant, or limited practitioner
who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a
violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury
immediately to the local arson bureau, if there is such a bureau in the
jurisdiction in which the person is attended or treated, or otherwise to local
law enforcement authorities.
      (3)   No manager, superintendent, or other person in charge of a
hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility in which a person is attended
or treated for any burn injury inflicted by an explosion or other incendiary
device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a violent,
malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury immediately
to the local arson bureau, if there is such a bureau in the jurisdiction in
which the person is attended or treated, or otherwise to local law enforcement
authorities.

(e)(2) or (3) of this section shall fail to file, within three working days
after attending or treating the victim, a written report of the burn injury
with the office of the State Fire Marshal. The report shall be made on a form
provided by the State Fire Marshal.
      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding R.C. §
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.
   (f)   (1)   Any doctor of medicine or osteopathic medicine, hospital intern
or resident, nurse, psychologist, social worker, independent social worker,
social work assistant, licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed
professional counselor, independent marriage and family therapist, or marriage
and family therapist who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
patient or client has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in R.C.
§ 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.
   (g)   Division (a) or (d) of this section does not require disclosure of
information, when any of the following applies:
      (1)   The information is privileged by reason of the relationship between
attorney and client; physician and patient; advanced practice registered nurse

shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.

keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog

of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether

dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.

by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as

analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The

portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,

672.03   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61
(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer’s or

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Renter.” A person who owns rented property.
      (2)   “Rentee.” A person who pays consideration to a renter for the use
of rented property.
   (b)   Each of the following shall be considered evidence of intent to commit

      (1)   At the time of entering into the rental contract, the rentee
presented the renter with identification that was materially false, fictitious,
or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment, or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by
law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;

more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or 698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)
(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and 698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail
term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other
than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate, including, but not
limited to, requiring that the offender not ingest or be injected with a drug
of abuse and submit to random drug testing and requiring that the results of
the drug test indicate that the offender did not ingest or was not injected
with a drug of abuse. If the court imposes a jail term upon the offender, the
court may impose any community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions in addition to the jail term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(4), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(4)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(4)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(4)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (5)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (6)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.

(ORC 2929.28) (Ord. 12-2004. Passed 2-3-04.)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall

or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   ( Editor's note: Section

802.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. Based on evidence concerning the negative secondary effects
of adult entertainment businesses on the community, in studies from other
communities, the Council finds that adult entertainment businesses in the
Village of Brooklyn Heights cause negative secondary effects. The purpose of
this chapter is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to minimize and
control the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses within
the Village in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the Village. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials or communication, including sexually oriented
entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition
of entertainment that is obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult entertainment businesses on the community presented in findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v.
Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), Ellwest Stereo Theater Inc. v. Boner,
718 F. Supp. 1553 (M.D. Tenn. 1989), and Broadway Books, Inc. v. Roberts 642
F.Supp. 486 (E.D. Tenn. 1986); and on studies in other cities, including New
York, New York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with
Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently inadequately controlled by
the operators of such establishments. Further, there is presently no adequate
mechanism to make the owners of such establishments within the Village
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view sexually
oriented films.
      (6)   The findings noted in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) hereof, raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
adult entertainment businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place
a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that adult entertainment
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the adult entertainment business and fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in adult entertainment businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex related crimes, including illegal public sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in adult entertainment
businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will
facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal,
State and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest
in protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all adult entertainment
businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing
illegal sexual activity on the premises of adult entertainment businesses and
will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other
Federal, State and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of adult entertainment
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal, State and
local laws and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in an adult
entertainment business or adult motel. Barring such individuals from the
management of and employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of
years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related
criminal acts.

   Applications to establish any of the regulated uses set forth in Section
802.03 shall be forwarded immediately by the Building Inspector to the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may recommend that Council waive the
1,000-foot separation regulation if, after receiving evidence at a regular
meeting, the following specific findings are made:
      (1)   That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest
or injurious to nearby properties, nor will it adversely affect the general
welfare of the neighborhood, and that the spirit and intent of this chapter
will be observed.
      (2)   That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a “skid row” area.
      (3)   That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area
will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation, nor will it
interfere with any program of urban renewal.
      (4)   That all applicable regulations of this chapter will be observed.
   (b)   Prior to any recommendation granting permission for such regulated
use, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall give due notice of receipt of any
application under consideration (Notice of Application) to all persons who are
the owners of any real property, to the occupants of all single, two, three and
four-family buildings and to the managers of all multi-unit buildings over four
families (who shall be requested to post such notice in an appropriate location
within the multi-unit building) and to all places within 1,000 feet, and to any
neighborhood improvement organizations known to exist in the area (who have
informed the Building Department in writing of their existence). Such notice
shall be delivered personally or by mail, addressed to the respective owners
and, if the tenant's name is not known, the term “occupant” may be used.
   (c)   The Notice of Application shall inform the recipient of the
applicant's name, the applicant's proposal, the local address and the lot
number and subdivision name of the premises in question, and the section of the
Zoning Code under which the proposal is being processed. Such Notice shall also
invite the expression of comments, statements or opinions, either in writing or
in person, with a time period expiring not less than fourteen days from the
mailing date of such Notice of Application.
   (d)   Subsequent to the deadline for response to the Notice of Application,
a decision shall be made by the Board of Zoning Appeals (taking into
consideration the comments, statements and opinions expressed) to recommend to
Council to either approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposal in
accordance with the standards set forth in this section. The recommendation of
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject to the approval of Council.
   (e)   A copy of the recommendation of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
mailed to the applicant and to all persons responding to the Notice of
Application, informing them that the Board's recommendation will not take
effect pending a public hearing and decision by Council.
   (f)   Council may waive the location requirements upon appeal of any of the
regulated uses if the findings required in subsection (a) hereof are
specifically made and after receiving a report and recommendation from the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (g)   In recommending or approving a permit for any regulated use, the Board
of Zoning Appeals or Council may impose any such conditions or limitations upon
the establishment, location, construction, maintenance or operation of the
regulated use as may, in its judgment, be necessary for the protection of the
public interest. Any evidence and guarantee may be required as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.
   (h)   When the decision of Council becomes final, Council shall immediately
notify the Building Inspector in writing indicating the approval, approval with
conditions (in which case the conditions shall be set out in detail) or denial.
      If the decision of Council approves with conditions the requested waiver,
the Building Inspector shall, if all other applicable Building Code and Zoning
Code regulations have been complied with, issue an occupancy permit subject to
any conditions imposed.

of the full administrative record for the matter, including a complete
transcript of all the original papers, testimony and evidence offered, heard
and taken into consideration in issuing the final order. The Board and all
other departments or agencies of the Village shall provide any further
information, assistance or cooperation requested by the reviewing court without
delay.
   (d)   Any licensee lawfully operating an adult entertainment business or
adult motel prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, may continue to operate said business
during the pendency of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals or to a court.
   (e)   Any licensee lawfully acting as an employee in an adult entertainment
business or adult motel prior to the denial of a license renewal application,
or the suspension or revocation of a license, may continue to serve in such
capacity during the pendency of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals or to
a court.
   (f)   In the event that an applicant for a new adult business license or a
new adult entertainment employee license seeks judicial review of the denial of
a new license, and such review does not result in a final judicial decision
within sixty days of the date the appeal was filed, the Village will issue such
applicant a provisional adult business license or adult entertainment employee
license upon request of the applicant. The provisional license will:
      (1)   Allow an applicant for an adult business license to operate the
adult entertainment business or adult motel named in the license application
under the same terms as a normal adult business license issued pursuant to
Section
802.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof;
      (2)   Allow an applicant for an adult entertainment employee license to
act as an employee on the premises of an adult entertainment business or adult
motel under the same terms as a normal adult entertainment employee license
issued pursuant to Section
802.11 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof; and
      (3)   Be subject to the same requirements as a normal adult business
license or adult entertainment employee license issued under Section
802.09 or Section
802.11 of this chapter.
   (g)   A provisional license will expire on whichever of the following three
dates is earliest:
      (1)   The date that a judicial decision is issued upholding the license
denial;
      (2)   The date on which a non-provisional adult business license or adult
entertainment employee license is issued to the applicant pursuant to a
judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)   The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (h)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Building Inspector pursuant to Section
802.14(b) of this chapter. The Building Inspector shall grant an application
for renewal of a provisional license unless he or she determines that new
grounds exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
802.09 or Section
802.11 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
Village has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial
appeal of the previous license denial.
(Ord. 82-99. Passed 8-3-99.)
802.18   TRANSFER OF LICENSES.

another or from one location to another. Any purported transfer of an adult
business license shall automatically and immediately revoke that license.
   (b)   An adult entertainment employee license is not transferable from one
licensee to another, but the use of the license by the individual to whom it
was issued may be transferred from one licensed adult entertainment business or
adult motel to another such licensed establishment during the term of the
license, provided that the licensee gives written notice of such transfer to
the Building Inspector within fifteen days of such transfer.
(Ord. 82-99. Passed 8-3-99.)
802.19   ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS FOR ADULT MOTELS.
   (a)   Evidence that a sleeping room in a hotel, motel or similar commercial
establishment has been rented and vacated two or more times in less than ten
hours creates a rebuttable presumption that the establishment is an adult motel
as that term is defined in Section
802.02 of this chapter.
   (b)   Evidence that a person in control of a sleeping room in a hotel, motel
or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping room to
a person and, within ten hours from the time the room was rented, has rented or
subrented the same sleeping room again, creates a rebuttable presumption that
the establishment is an adult motel as that term is defined in Section
802.02 of this chapter.
   (c)   For purposes of subsection (b) hereof, the terms “rent” and “subrent”
mean the act of permitting a room to be occupied for any form of consideration.
   (d)   No person shall operate a hotel, motel or similar commercial
establishment that is found to be an adult motel, as defined in Section
802.02 of this chapter, without a valid adult business license for such

contain video reproduction equipment, and no entertainment of any kind shall be
offered in restrooms. If the premises have two or more employees' stations

time.
      (9)   The premises shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures of
sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are permitted
access, including both the interior of viewing booths and restrooms, at an
illumination level of not less than five foot- candles as measured at floor
level.
      (10)   The illumination described above shall be maintained at all times
that any patron is present in the premises. In the event of a power failure,
the business shall stop operating immediately and all patrons shall be cleared

illumination level can be assured.
      (11)   No openings of any kind shall be permitted to exist between

any poles or other facilities within the streets of the Village for the conduct

time established for a hearing on said petition, the grantee shall notify its
subscribers of the hearing by announcement on at least two channels of its
system between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. for five consecutive days.
Additionally, hearings shall be announced in a newspaper of general circulation
at least five days before the date of the hearing. Following all proper notice,
but in no event later than ninety days from the date of said petition, the
Council shall hold an appropriate public hearing to consider the proposed new
rates, at which hearing all parties desiring to be heard, including the
grantee, shall be heard on any matters relating to the performance of the
franchise, the grantee's services, and the proposed new rates.
         D.   Within ninety days after the hearing, the Council shall render a
written decision on the grantee's proposal, either accepting, rejecting, or
modifying the same and reciting the basis for its decision.
         E.   If the Council fails to act within ninety days of the grantee's
petition filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)B. hereof, the grantee shall
thereafter be entitled to put its proposed new rates into effect on a
provisional basis, provided that it shall keep a full and accurate accounting
of all income resulting from said provisional rates and shall be obligated, for
a period of six months thereafter, to refund the amount by which said
provisional rates exceed the rates ultimately established by the Council. Upon
request by the Council, the grantee shall provide a bond or other reasonable
surety to ensure that possible refunds due under this subsection shall be
promptly made. The bond or surety shall be in an amount not to exceed the
difference between the amount of revenues generated in six months at the
previous existing rates and the amount of revenues expected to be generated in
six months at the provisional rates. Such bond shall be in a form approved by
the Law Director.
         F.   The criteria for the Council's decision in such matters shall be
the establishment of rates which are “fair and reasonable” to both the grantee
and its subscribers.
         G.   In order for the Council to determine whether proposed rate
changes comport with the criteria established in subsection (f) hereof, the
grantee's petition for a rate increase shall include the following financial
reports which shall reflect the operations of its cable television system
within the Village:
            1.   Balance sheet
            2.   Income statement
            3.   Cash flow statement
            4.   Statement of sources and application of funds
            5.   Detailed supporting schedules of expenses, income, assets and
other items as may be required
            6.   Statement of current and projected subscribers and
penetration.
            The grantee's account records shall be available for inspection by
the Village at all reasonable times. The documents listed above shall include
sufficient detail and/or footnotes as may be necessary to provide the Village
with the information needed to make accurate determinations as to the financial
condition of the system. All financial statements shall be certified as
accurate by an officer of the grantee.
         H.   Any disagreement between the Village and the grantee concerning
interpretations and calculations of the financial and statistical information
provided by the grantee may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction,
provided that final decisions concerning approval or denial of requested rate
increases shall be made solely by the Village Council.
   (c)   All Rates to be Non-Discriminatory. The grantee shall administer any
and all rates and charges so as not to give preference to nor discriminate
among subscribers of like category or class. Nothing in the foregoing shall be
deemed to prevent the grantee from establishing:
      (1)   Special temporary reduced rates for periodic promotional offers to
attract new subscribers or for subscribers who pay promptly;
      (2)   Reasonable policies for deposits, penalties, or denial of service
where a particular subscriber has proven a bona fide credit problem; or
      (3)   Separate rates for commercial and non-commercial users of access
channels.
   (d)   Advance Charges and Deposits. The grantee may require subscribers to
pay for basic subscriber service one month in advance. The grantee may also
require a reasonable security deposit for provision of the basic converter
unit. Such deposit, in the absence of theft or avoidable damage to the
converter, shall be refundable to the subscriber. No other advance payment or
deposit shall be required by the grantee for basic subscriber service, except
as provided in paragraph (c)(2) hereof.
   (e)   Disconnection. Except as otherwise provided by Council, there shall be
no charge for the disconnection of any installation or outlet. If any
subscriber fails to pay a properly due fee or charge, the grantee may
disconnect the subscriber's service outlet, provided, however, that such
disconnection shall not be effected until forty-five days after the due date of
said delinquent fee or charge and shall include seven days' written notice of
the intent to disconnect, properly mailed to the subscriber in question. After
disconnection, upon payment in full of the delinquent fee or charge, any
reasonable collection expense or penalty, and the payment of a reconnection
charge, the grantee shall promptly reinstate the subscriber's cable service.
   (f)   Refunds to Subscribers.
      (1)   If any subscriber terminates the basic subscriber service during
the first twelve months of said service because of the failure of the grantee
to render service in accordance with the standards set forth in Sections
810.17 and
810.18, the grantee shall refund to such subscriber an amount equal to the
installation or reconnection charges paid, if any, by the subscriber,
multiplied by the fraction derived by dividing the month(s) remaining before
the annual anniversary of service, divided by twelve.
      (2)   If any subscriber terminates basic subscriber service prior to the
end of a prepaid period, all unearned service fees as of the date the grantee
receives written notice of said termination shall be refunded to the
subscriber.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.17   OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   The grantee shall put, keep and maintain all parts of the system in
good condition throughout the entire franchise period.
   (b)   The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly as
specified in Section
810.18, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time
possible. Such interruption, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice
and shall occur during periods of minimum system use.
   (c)   The grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere
with television reception of persons not served by the grantee, nor shall the
system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner the operation of the
various utilities serving the residents of the Village.
   (d)   The grantee shall continue, throughout the term of the franchise, to
maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this
chapter. Should the Council find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed to
maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it, by
resolution, specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the grantee shall
make such improvements. Failure to make such improvements within sixty days of
such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which the remedy
set forth in Section
810.99 is applicable.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.18   LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE; SERVICE MAINTENANCE STANDARDS; COMPLAINT
PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The grantee shall maintain a local business office or a toll-free
telephone listing for the purpose of receiving inquiries, complaints and
requests for repairs or adjustments from its customers and the general public.
Said office or listing shall be so operated that complaints and requests for
repairs or adjustments may be received and processed with a minimum delay.
Provision shall also be made for telephonically receiving service interruption
calls on a twenty-four hour basis. Confirmation of a service request received
by a recorder shall be made the next business day.
   (b)   The grantee shall maintain a repair and maintenance crew capable of
responding to subscriber complaints or requests for service within a normal
service interval. No charge shall be made to the subscriber for this service.
   (c)   Any verbal, telephonic, or written complaint relating to the quality
or continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service interval.
In the event that such complaints are not responded to or service is not
restored to the levels required by the FCC or by the terms of this chapter
during said normal service interval, the subscriber shall be entitled to a
rebate of one- fifteenth of his or her monthly service charge for each day or
part thereof between the end of the normal service interval and the time
service is restored to said standards. This provision shall not apply if such
delay is occasioned because of an act of God, strike, national emergency, or
any other circumstance beyond the control of the grantee. Similarly, this
provision shall not apply to service requests or complaints pertaining to
television set malfunction or other breakdowns not related to the operation of
the cable television system. The Village Complaint Officer, provided for in
subsection (d) hereof, shall be responsible for invoking said penalty upon
receiving a written subscriber complaint. The Complaint Officer shall hold a
hearing on such complaint to be conducted in the manner prescribed in and
otherwise governed by paragraph (d)(2) hereof.
   (d)   (1)   The grantee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting
upon and resolving subscriber complaints. The grantee shall furnish a notice of
such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial subscription to the
system. In addition, the grantee shall maintain a written record, or “log,”
listing the date and time of customer complaints, identifying the subscriber,
and describing the nature of the complaints and when and what action was taken
by the grantee in response thereto. Such records shall be kept at the grantee's
local office reflecting the operations to date and shall be available for
inspection during regular business hours.
      (2)   The Mayor shall designate a member of the Administration as the
Village Complaint Officer, who shall have primary responsibility for the
continuing administration of complaint procedures hereunder. Any subscriber,
user, programmer, or other interested person who has a complaint regarding the
quality of cable television service, equipment malfunctions, billings, or any
other matter, which remains unresolved for thirty days after it has been
brought to the grantee's attention, may file a complaint, in writing, with the
Complaint Officer. Upon the filing of such a complaint, said Complaint Officer
shall notify the grantee and make an investigation to determine whether or not
there is probable cause to credit the allegations. If he or she determines
after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations
of the complaint, he or she shall so notify the grantee and the complainant and
promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and persuasion. In the
event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain conciliation within a
reasonable time, he or she shall promptly set the matter for a hearing where
all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will be decided.
The Complaint Officer shall make public his or her decision, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within thirty days thereafter, either
the grantee or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing, the
decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Officer. The affirmance, rejection or modification of
said decision by the Council shall be final.
   (e)   (1)   Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there
exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Officer
shall have the right and authority to compel the grantee to test, analyze, and
report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be delivered to the
Complaint Officer no later than fourteen days after said Officer formally
notifies the grantee and shall include the following information: the nature of
the complaints which precipitated the special tests; what system component(s)
were tested, the equipment used and the procedure employed in said testing; the
results of such tests; the method in which said complaints were resolved, if
applicable; and any and all additional information deemed relevant by the
Complaint Officer.
      (2)   Said tests and analyses shall be supervised by a registered
professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the grantee and selected by
the Village. The aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of special tests and
forward to the Complaint Officer such records interpreting the results of the
test and recommending action to be taken by the Village.
   (f)   The grantee shall notify each subscriber at the time of initial
installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer and of
the procedures contained in this section.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.19   GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (a)   The grantee agrees by the acceptance of the franchise to indemnify,
keep and save the Village free and harmless from liability on account of
injuries or damage to persons or property arising out of the construction,
maintenance, repair and operation of its cable television system. In the event
that suit shall be brought against the Village, either independently or jointly
with the grantee on account thereof, the grantee shall, at the sole risk and
expense of the grantee, upon demand of the Village, made by and through the Law
Director, appear in and defend any and all suits, actions, or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial, quasijudicial, administrative, legislative, or
otherwise, brought or instituted or had by third persons or duly constituted
authorities, against or affecting the Village, its officers, boards,
commissions, agents or employees, and arising out of or pertaining to the
exercise of enjoyment of such franchise, or the granting thereof by the
Village. The grantee shall pay and satisfy or shall cause to be paid and
satisfied any judgment, decree, order, directive, or demand rendered, made or
issued against the grantee, the Village, its officers, boards, commissions,
agents, or employees in any of these premises; and such indemnity shall exist
and continue without reference to or limitation by the amount of any bond,
policy of insurance, deposit, undertaking or other assurance required
hereunder, or otherwise, provided that neither the grantee nor the Village
shall make or enter into any compromise or settlement of any claim, demand,
cause of action, action, suit, or other proceeding, without first obtaining the
written consent of the other.
   (b)   The grantee shall pay, and by its acceptance of the franchise
specifically agrees that it will pay all expenses incurred by the Village in
defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned in
subsection (a) above. These expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses,
such as attorney fees, and shall also include the reasonable value of any
services rendered by the Village's attorney or his or her assistants or any
employees of the Village or its agents.
   (c)   The grantee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the franchise
specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the term of the
franchise, liability insurance insuring the Village and the grantee with regard
to all damages mentioned in subsection (a) hereof in the minimum amounts of:
      (1)   $300,000 for property damage for any one occurrence;
      (2)   $500,000 for bodily injury to any one person; and
      (3)   $1,000,000 for bodily injury in any one occurrence.
   (d)   The insurance policy obtained by the grantee in compliance with this
section shall be approved by the Village, and such policy, along with written
evidence of payment of required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with
the Clerk/Treasurer during the term of the franchise.
   (e)   Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by
the Village thereunder shall be construed as limiting the terms, obligations or
liabilities imposed under other sections of the franchise.
   (f)   All insurance policies maintained pursuant to the franchise shall
contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be
cancelled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety
until thirty days after receipt by the Village of Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, by
registered mail, of a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to
renew.”
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.20   LETTER OF CREDIT.
   (a)   Within ten days after the award of a franchise, the grantee shall
deposit with the Clerk/Treasurer a letter of credit from a local financial
institution in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). The form
and content of such letter of credit shall be approved by the Village. The
letter of credit shall be used to ensure the faithful performance by the
grantee of all provisions of this chapter; compliance with all orders, permits
and directions of any agency, commission, board, department, division or office
of the Village having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the
franchise; and the payment by the grantee of any claims, liens, and taxes due
the Village which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance
of the cable television system.
   (b)   The letter of credit shall be maintained at twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000) during the entire term of the franchise, even if amounts have
to be withdrawn pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) hereof.
   (c)   If the grantee fails to pay the Village any compensation within the
time fixed herein, fails, after ten days' notice, to pay to the Village any
taxes due and unpaid, fails to repay the Village within such ten days any
damages, costs or expenses which the Village is compelled to pay by reason of
an act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise, or fails,
after three days' notice by the Village of such failure, to comply with any
provision of the franchise which the Village reasonably determines can be
remedied by demand on the letter of credit, the Village may, subject to the
following paragraph, request payment of the amount thereof, with interest and
any penalties, from the letter of credit. Upon such request for payment, the
Village shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof.
   Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in case of a bona fide dispute
regarding compliance, the grantee may request a hearing before the Mayor within
thirty days after notification of non- compliance and penalty by the Village.
No action may be taken on said letter of credit until a prior hearing with an
opportunity to be heard has been conducted. At such hearing, all parties may
give evidence, and the merits of the dispute will be decided. The Mayor shall
make public his or her decision, along with a statement reciting the basis
therefor. Within thirty days, the grantee may appeal to the Council, in
writing, the decision rendered by the Mayor. At the appeal hearing, the grantee
may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of controlling law, at which
time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the decision of the Mayor. The
affirmance, rejection or modification of said decision by the Council shall be
final.
   (d)   The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the letter of
credit are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by
negotiation with the grantee or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of a right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any
other right the Village may have.
   (e)   The letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this letter of credit may not be
canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety
until thirty days after receipt by the Village of Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, by
registered mail, or a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to
renew.”
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.21   PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   Within thirty days after the award of a franchise, the grantee shall
file with the Clerk/Treasurer a performance bond in the amount of two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in favor of the Village. This bond shall be
maintained throughout the construction period for the initial service area of
the franchise.
(Ord. 39-80. Passed 9-2-80.)
   (b)   In the event that the grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance
or regulation governing the construction of the cable television system, or
fails to well and truly observe, fulfill and perform each term and condition of
the franchise pertaining to such construction, including proposals contained in
the grantee's application for the franchise which are incorporated herein by
reference, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally, from the
principal and surety of the bond, any damage or loss suffered by the Village as
a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or
cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, including the Village's legal staff,
and costs, up to the full amount of the bond.
   (c)   The Council shall, upon completion of construction of the initial
service area, waive the requirement of the grantee to maintain said bond;
however, the Council may require a performance bond to be posted by the grantee
for any construction subsequent to the completion of the initial service area
in a reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the Council.
   (d)   The bond shall contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be cancelled
by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until
thirty days after receipt by the Village of Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, by
registered mail, of a written notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.22   RECORDS, REPORTS AND FILINGS.
   (a)   The grantee shall keep complete and accurate books of account and
records of its business and operations under and in connection with the terms
of this chapter.
   (b)   The Mayor or his or her authorized agent shall have access to all
books of account and records of the grantee for the purpose of ascertaining the
correctness of any and all reports and shall be given local access to all other
records upon reasonable request.
   (c)   In addition to the above, the grantee shall file annually with the
Village, no later than ninety days after the end of the grantee's fiscal year,
a copy of its report to its stockholders (if it prepared such a report) and
income statement applicable to its operations during the preceding twelve-month
period, a balance sheet, and a statement of its properties devoted to cable
television operations, by categories, giving its investment in such properties
on the basis of original cost, less applicable depreciation. These reports
shall be certified as correct by an officer of the grantee, and there shall be
submitted along with them such other reasonable information as the Mayor may
request with respect to the grantee's properties and expenses relating to its
cable television operations within the Village. The Village reserves the right
to request that the annual report be certified by a certified public accounting
firm.
   (d)   Copies of all petitions, applications, and communications submitted by
the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange
Commission, or any other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency
having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting cable television
operations authorized pursuant to the franchise shall be submitted
simultaneously to the Village.
   (e)   Any false entry in the books of account or records of the grantee or
false statements in the reports to the Mayor as to material fact, knowingly
made by the grantee, shall constitute a breach of a material provision of this
chapter and the franchise. (Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.23   TRANSFER OF CONTROL.
   (a)   No transfer of control of the cable television system shall take
place, whether by forced or voluntary sale, lease, mortgage, assignment,
encumbrance or any other form of disposition, without prior notice to and
approval by the Council, which shall not be unreasonably refused. The notice
shall include full identifying particulars of the proposed transaction, and the
Council shall act by resolution. The Council shall have ninety days within
which to approve or disapprove a transfer of control. If no action is taken
within such ninety days, approval shall be deemed to have been given.
   (b)   The consent or approval of the Council to any assignment, lease,
transfer, sub-lease, or mortgage of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver
or release of the Village in and to the streets.
   (c)   For the purposes of this section, the term “control” is not limited to
majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised.
   (d)   A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall
arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of
ten percent of the voting shares of the grantee.
   (e)   A mortgage or pledge of the cable system equipment or any part
thereof, or a leasing by the grantee from another person of said cable system
equipment or part thereof, for financing purposes or otherwise, shall be made
only with prior approval of the Council and shall be subject and subordinate to
the rights of the Village under this chapter or applicable law.
   (f)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Council shall not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise before completion of
construction of the initial service area of the energized cable.
   (g)   The Council reserves the right to review the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of the system, and any assignee or transferee to the
franchise expressly agrees that any negotiated sale value which the Council
deems unreasonable will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent
request for rate increases. Reasonableness of purchase price shall be
determined by taking into consideration the original cost of all tangible and
intangible property, as well as salvage value, book value, replacement value,
cash flow, and other factors.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.24   FRANCHISE REVIEW, RENEWAL, CANCELLATION AND EXPIRATION.
   (a)   The Council shall not hold any meeting involving the review, renewal,
cancellation or expiration of the grantee's franchise unless the Mayor has (1)
advised the grantee, in writing, at least thirty days prior to such meeting, as
to its time, place and purpose, and (2) published a notice at least once, ten
days before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Village.
   (b)   It shall be the policy of the Village to amend the franchise upon
application of the grantee when necessary to enable the grantee to take
advantage of advancements in the state-of-the- art which will afford it an
opportunity to more effectively, efficiently or economically serve its
subscribers, provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to
require the Village to make any amendment. Further, every two years during the
term of the franchise, the Council shall hold a public hearing, the purpose of
which will be to consider system performance, design modifications, the need
for rate regulation, or other possible modifications in the franchise of a
nature that would not result in effectively terminating the same under the
existing Federal Communications Commission Rules for cable television. The
franchise may be amended at any time in order to conform with the applicable
Federal law and Federal Communications Commission rulings after notice and
public hearing.
   (c)   The Council shall, no later than 120 days prior to the expiration of
the franchise period, hold a public hearing to review the grantee's performance
during the entire term of its franchise. At such hearing, the Council shall
consider the adequacy of the franchise from the standpoint of the Village, the
grantee and the Federal Communications Commission Rules for cable television,
and determine the advisability of renewing the grantee's franchise for a period
of ten years.
   (d)   The Council shall hear any interested persons during said meeting and
shall determine whether or not the grantee did reasonably comply with the terms
and conditions imposed by this chapter and the franchise.
   (e)   If the Council determines that the grantee's performance has been
satisfactory, in accordance with the terms and conditions imposed by this
chapter and the franchise, the Council may renew the grantee's franchise for a
period up to ten years. The Village shall have the right to recoup from the
grantee those direct expenses above normal administrative costs incurred
pursuant to renewal of the franchise.
   (f)   If the Council determines that the performance of the grantee has not
been satisfactory, under the terms and conditions imposed by this chapter and
the franchise, it shall have the right not to renew the franchise. (Ord. 16-80.
Passed 5-20-80.)
810.25   REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   In addition to all other rights and powers reserved by or pertaining
to the Village, the Village reserves as an additional and as a separate and
distinct remedy the right to revoke the franchise and all rights and privileges
of the grantee hereunder, in any of the following events or for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   The grantee shall, by act or omission, violate any material term or
condition of this chapter and shall, within thirty days following written
demand by the Village to effect compliance, fail to do so;
      (2)   The grantee fails to begin or complete construction as provided
under the franchise and the grantee's application as incorporated herein;
      (3)   Any provision of this chapter shall be finally adjudged by a court
of law invalid or unenforceable, and the Council of the Village further finds
that such provision constitutes at that time a consideration material to the
continuance of the franchise herein granted;
      (4)   The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its
debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt, and the conditions in Section
810.26 have not been met, or all or part of the grantee's facilities should be
sold under an instrument to secure a debt and are not redeemed by the grantee
within thirty days from said sale;
      (5)   The grantee fails to restore service following ninety-six
consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such
interruption is obtained from the Village;
      (6)   The grantee attempts to or does practice any fraud or deceit in its
conduct or relations with the Village under the franchise;
      (7)   The grantee attempts to or does engage in the business of selling
at retail, leasing, renting, repairing or servicing of television sets or
radios;
      (8)   The grantee attempts to or does solicit or refer, or cause or
permit the solicitation or referral of, any subscriber to persons engaged in
any business prohibited to be engaged in by the grantee;
      (9)   The grantee attempts to or does provide information concerning the
viewing patterns of identifiable individual subscribers to any person, group,
or organization for any purpose, without the consent of the subscriber;
      (10)   The grantee attempts to or does enter or encroach upon or
interfere with or obstruct any private property without the express consent of
the owner; or
      (11)   The grantee attempts to or does provide any repair service to its
subscribers for a fee, which repair extends beyond the connection of its
service or the determination by the grantee of the quality of its signal to the
recipients thereof.
   (b)   No such revocation shall be effective unless or until the Council of
the Village shall have adopted an ordinance setting forth the cause and reason
for the revocation and the effective date thereof, which ordinance shall not be
adopted without thirty days' prior notice thereof to the grantee and an
opportunity for the grantee to be heard upon the proposed adoption of said
ordinance. In the event the revocation as proposed in said ordinance depends
upon a finding of fact, such finding of fact as made by the Village Council, in
writing, after the hearing provided for, if requested by the grantee, shall be
conclusive.
   (c)   The grantee shall not be declared in default nor be subject to any
sanction under any provision of this section in any case in which the
performance of such provision is prevented for reasons beyond its control.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.26   FORECLOSURE.
   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of
the system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a substantial
part of the system, the grantee shall immediately notify the Village of such
fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in
control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of Section
810.23 governing the consent of the Council to such change in control of the
grantee shall apply.

relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority
of the Village to grant the franchise. The grantee, by acceptance of the

franchise by any understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or
written, by or on behalf of the Village or by any other third person concerning
any term or condition of the franchise not expressed herein. The grantee

read the terms and conditions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of
the risks of the meaning of such terms and conditions and agrees that, in the
event of any ambiguity therein or in the event of any, other dispute over the
meaning thereof, the same shall be construed strictly against the grantee and
in favor of the Village.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.32   COMPLIANCE BY GRANTEE REQUIRED.
   The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms or
conditions of the franchise by any failure of the Village upon any one or more
occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms or
conditions. (Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.33   TIME LIMITS STRICTLY CONSTRUED.
   Whenever the franchise shall set forth any time for any action to be
performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the
essence, and any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted
shall always be sufficient grounds for the Village to revoke the franchise.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.34   CONTESTING VALIDITY OF FRANCHISE PROHIBITED.
   The grantee agrees by the acceptance of the franchise that it will not at
any time set up against the Village in any claim or proceeding any condition or

Village did not have the power or authority to make such term or condition, but
shall be required to accept the validity of the terms and conditions of the
franchise in their entirety.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.35   RIGHTS RESERVED TO THE VILLAGE.
   Without limitation upon the rights which the Village might otherwise have,

under the Constitution of the State of Ohio, the laws of Ohio, or the Brooklyn
Heights Codified Ordinances.

810.36   GRANTEE'S APPLICATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.
   The grantee shall provide all services specifically set forth in its
application to provide cable television service within the Village, and by its
acceptance of the franchise the grantee specifically grants and agrees that its
application is thereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the
franchise and this chapter. In the event of a conflict between such proposals
and the provisions of this chapter, that provision which provides the greatest
benefit to the Village, in the opinion of the Council, shall prevail. Failure
to provide services as promised in the grantee's application as incorporated
herein shall be deemed a material breach of this chapter, to which the
provisions of Sections
810.25(a) and
810.99 shall apply.

cashier's check, approved by the Village, in the amount of two thousand, five
hundred dollars ($2,500), made payable to the Village of Brooklyn Heights,

account of the Village and shall serve to recover expenses incurred by the
Village in the granting of the franchise. Said expenses shall include, but not
be limited to, consultants’ expenses and the reasonable value of services
performed by the Village's employees, agent or contractors. Any funds remaining
after all expenses have been paid shall be refunded to the grantee. The Village
does not guarantee any amounts to be refunded.
(Ord. 16-80. Passed 5-20-80.)
810.38   COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS; CONFLICTS.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary,
the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the
State and Federal governments or any administrative agencies thereof, provided,
however, that if any such State or Federal law or regulation shall require the
grantee to perform any service or shall prohibit the grantee from performing
any service or shall permit the grantee to perform any service in conflict with
the terms of the franchise or of any law or regulation of the Village, then, as
soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the
Village Mayor of the point of conflict believed to exist between such
regulation or law and the laws or regulations of the Village or the franchise.
   (b)   If the Council determines that a material provision of this chapter is
affected by such subsequent action, the Council shall have the right to modify
any of the provisions herein to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to
carry out the full intent and purpose of this chapter.

810.39   SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and

remaining portions hereof.

   (a)   Applicability. This chapter shall apply to the operation of
computerized sweepstakes terminals and internet cafés or establishments
operating such terminals. This chapter shall only apply to the operation of
such terminals that are lawfully operating pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code
and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to legalize, license or
authorize any operation of a device that is unlawful to operate pursuant to the
Ohio Revised Code. This chapter shall apply immediately to all devices, arcades
and/or internet cafés that commence operation after the date of enactment of
this chapter. All arcades, internet cafés, or establishments in existence at
the time of enactment of this chapter shall come into compliance with all
sections of this chapter no later than 30 days after enactment unless otherwise
stated herein.
   (b)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter and the policy of the
Village of Brooklyn Heights to establish standards for licensing and regulation
of computerized sweepstakes devices and arcades and/or internet cafés upon
which they are located and operated. This chapter is designed to prevent safety
and fire hazards, prevent disturbances, preserve the peaceful enjoyment of
neighboring establishments and residences, and preventing gambling and other
criminal behavior in the Village.
(Ord. 13-2011. Passed 3-15-11.)
816.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   (a)   “Anything of value”. Cash, cash equivalents, tangible objects, credits
to play, and any other tangibles or intangibles, no matter how slight. Anything
of value includes playing a game, viewing a video display, hearing an audio
transmission, and reading entries or outcomes from any other kind of device. A
person who gives anything of value for a product or service, whether tangible
or intangible, in any way, directly or indirectly, in association with being
given access to the use of an entertainment device, is deemed to have given
value for the access to the entertainment device.
   (b)   “Computerized sweepstakes device”. Any computer, machine, game or
apparatus which, upon the insertion of a coin, token, access number, magnetic
card, or similar object, or upon the payment of anything of value, wherein a
product or service may be provided, and may be operated by the public generally
for use as a contest of skill, entertainment or amusement, whether or not
registering a score, and which provides the user with a chance to win anything
of value that is not de minimus, on a per play basis, or any cash payout or
anything that could be redeemed, directly or indirectly, for any cash payment,
and which is not gambling under State or local laws. Machines designated for
use by the State Lottery Commission are not computerized sweepstakes devices
for purposes of this
Chapter 816. “De minimus”, as used in this section, shall mean less than ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (c)   “Licensee”. The person or persons who sign an application for a
license hereunder and to whom such license is issued.
   (d)   “Operator”. Any person or persons having authority to control the
premises of an arcade and/or sweepstakes/internet café.
   (e)   “Owner”. Any person who possesses a pecuniary interest, either
directly or indirectly, of 25% or more in a sweepstakes/internet café.
   (f)   Sweepstakes/internet café.” Any premises upon which any computerized
sweepstakes device is located for the use or entertainment of the public,

whatsoever.

   (c)   If an application is not approved, the Village shall notify the

shall be open to inspection and viewing of operations by law enforcement
officers and Fire Department personnel at all times of operation. No operator
shall fail to immediately permit entry to any such Village officials.
   (f)   Failure to register or pay a license fee for a computerized

816.04   LOCATION.

under this chapter, one-half of the application fee shall be returned to the
applicant. In the event that a license is revoked or suspended hereunder, no
portion of the license fee shall be returned.
   (b)   The device fee for each computerized sweepstakes device shall be five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for each device on the premises for each year. The
device fee shall be paid initially upon preliminary approval of the license
application but as a prerequisite to receiving the license, and then annually
for each year thereafter.
   (c)   The device fees, which are paid at the time of preliminary application
approval, are not refundable in any case. The license device fee shall be paid

more persons is a separate device.
   (d)   Licenses issued under this chapter shall not be transferable to any
other person, partnership, corporation, or other entity and the business may be
conducted only at the location for which the license is issued. The license

reduced or suspended.

suspension, the Village may assess the licensee a penalty fee of not less than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00) for any violation of this chapter. Each day a continuing violation
exists shall constitute a separate violation for purpose of assessing penalty

services performed or rendered within the Village.
   (c)   (1)   On the portion attributable to the Village on the net profits
earned on and after July 1, 2018, of all resident unincorporated business

in the Village.
      (2)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned

the salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation, and with respect to
the net profits of businesses, professions or other activities, earned on and
after July 1, 2018. The passage and approval of the Village Council’s
legislation which last amended this section shall not be deemed to impair in

withhold taxes or file returns by virtue of tax provisions enacted or in effect
prior to July 1, 2018, in the Village of Brooklyn Heights.
(1974 Code § 95.11; Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-6-18.)
882.06   METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to Village income taxes, if
the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both
within and without the boundaries of the Village shall disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of its net profits is attributable to that part of the
business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the Village, then
only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village
for the purpose of Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net
profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the
Village, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as
follows: Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to
be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each
of which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   (b)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
(Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)
882.07   SALES MADE IN THE VILLAGE DEFINED.
   As used in Section
882.06, “sales made in the Village” means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the Village.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Village, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a point
outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Village to purchasers outside the Village, regardless of where title
passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
(Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)
882.08   DETERMINATION OF BUSINESS ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE.
   (a)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
882.06, or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving said total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
882.06.
   (b)   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Village. (Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)
882.09   RENTALS.
   (a)   Rental income received by the taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Sections
882.04(c), (d) and (e), only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   (b)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of the number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management, or operation of such properties is a business activity
of such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject
to tax provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, and provided, further, that in the case of farm property, the owner
shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipt
derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds said two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, and provided, further, that the person who
operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   (c)   Property owners who are considered to have a business activity under
the provisions of this section shall submit or cause to be submitted to the
Administrator a list of names and addresses of all persons, firms,
corporations, or other entities occupying, leasing or renting any premises
within the Municipality. The required list shall be prepared as of December 31
of each year and submitted on or before January 31 of the following year.

882.10   OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   (a)   The portion of net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to October 1, 1968, allocable to the Village, may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village
until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
   (b)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the
Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the
Village.
   (c)   The Administrator shall provide, by rules and regulations, the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
(Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)

from the operation of a business);
   (j)   Salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation and net profits,

end of such fiscal year or period. Any person who has no income need not file

has taxable income must file a tax return with the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 89-96. Passed 11-6-96.)
882.13   FORM AND CONTENTS OF RETURN.
   A return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms furnished
by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, setting forth:
   (a)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from business, profession or other

income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax;
   (b)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
   (c)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other

month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return. The Administrator may
require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon, by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or
interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,

a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the Village. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the Village
by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related
by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other
method, he or she shall make allocations as he or she deems appropriate to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village.
(Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)
882.16   AMENDED RETURN.
   (a)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
882.32 through

Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 53-68. Passed 9-3-68.)
882.17   PAYMENT OF TAX ON FILING OF RETURN.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided,
however, that:
      (1)   Where any portion or the tax so due shall have been deducted at the

882.18; or
      (2)   Where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
882.19; or
      (3)   Where an income tax has been paid on the same income to another
municipality;
   Credit for the amount so deducted from the amount shown to be due shall be
given, and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing said return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election,
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (c)   If any employer who or that is liable for tax obligations imposed by
this chapter undergoes a fundamental change, then the employer and its manager
shall be liable for taxes due up to the date of the fundamental change. Taxes
and final tax returns shall be due immediately after the fundamental change.
Any successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the
successor owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes,
interest and penalties which the predecessor employer owes pursuant to this
chapter. The successor employer shall make such withholding until such time
that the predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and penalties. If
the successor fails to withhold said amount, then the successor and, in a
personal manner, the successor's manager, shall be jointly and severally liable
for the payment of said taxes, interest and penalties.
(Ord. 86-96. Passed 11-6-96.)
882.18   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the Village shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation, the tax of two percent per annum of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee, and
shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return and pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month,
provided, however, that if the amount of the tax so deducted by any employer in
any one month is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the employer may
defer the filing of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last
day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which such month
occurred.
   (b)   Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed or acceptable to
the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have,
in fact, been withheld.
   (c)   Such employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the Village as a trustee for the
benefit of the Village, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust
fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person's residence, even though such residence is in the Village,
but such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of the Village in
collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Every
manager is liable directly to the Village for payment of such funds, whether
actually collected by such employer or not. Any tax deducted and withheld is to
be considered paid to the Village, whether or not the employer actually remits
the tax to the Village, for purposes of determining employee payments or
credits.
      (2)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under
this chapter.
      (3)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees' or managers'
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled

         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         C.   The address on the individual's driver's license;
         D.   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact

individual's abode located outside of the Village and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Village.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

   (f)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
               As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
884.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
884.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
884.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, wages, salaries, and
other compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to
an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (f)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer.
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or (f)(3)B. of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            2.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.

property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to the Village’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village’s income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Withholding provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
884.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
884.01(b)(1), of two percent. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
               If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (c)(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted

this section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on twenty
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty days
in a calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last

services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

in this Section.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the twenty-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
884.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to

return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section.
   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
884.04(b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
884.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing Via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Village before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible tor an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
884.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (d)   Intentionally left blank.

         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax

884.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.

preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Village under Section
884.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

884.08   ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

884.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
884.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
884.18(a)(4).

withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village’s tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
884.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
884.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

884.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
884.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
884.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
884.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
884.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)    (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. or this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or State law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

accordance with division (a)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with a the Tax Administrator or the
Village by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

      (9)   "Withholding tax" includes amounts an employer, any agent of an

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the Village any return required to be filed, the following

(Ord. 68-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
884.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
income tax ordinance;

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any

papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
884.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
884.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
884.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(2)B.
of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
884.99 for a violation of Section
884.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board
member appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.

   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of erosion and
sediment control and stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize
damage to property and degradation of water resources, and will promote and
maintain the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of
Brooklyn Heights.
   (b)   This regulation will:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   (c)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village’s future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (d)   This regulation applies to all parcels used or being developed, either
wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways and
roads, underground cables, or pipelines; subdivisions or larger common plans of
development; industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential projects;
building activities on farms; redevelopment activities; general clearing and
grading; and all other uses that are not specifically exempted in division (f)
of this section.
   (e)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Brooklyn Heights shall comply with this regulation for roadway
projects initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable,
for projects initiated before that time.
   (f)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (g)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with erosion and sediment control
requirements.
   (h)   This regulation does not apply to construction or re-construction of
stand-alone single family dwellings when the parcel is not part of an overall
subdivision or is part of a subdivision that is in existence as of the adoption
of this chapter, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer.

1050.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR SWP3S.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the owner must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. The approved plan must be implemented until the
site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent to the site of soil-
disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion and sediment run-off
and damage, including, but not limited to, private properties, natural and
artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a fifty-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the State, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible, e.g. stream crossings
for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation and
restoration. Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal
and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables
1050.09.1  and
1050.09.2  below.

more than 14 days but less than one    area must be stabilized at least 7 days
year, and not within 50 feet of a      prior to transfer of ownership or
stream.                                operational responsibility.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1 or the onset of
winter.                                winter weather, whichever occurs first.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide
available at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than fourteen days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. The design,
installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address
factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation,
the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including
the range of soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
SCM upon approval from the Village Engineer is required for any one of the
following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3), inlet protection, or other sediment barriers.
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of
disturbed land.
            Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment
trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Ohio Rainwater and
Land Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a
sediment trap shall be limited to less than five acres. Contributing drainage
areas of five acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An
equivalent SCM may be utilized upon approval from the Village.
            The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage
zone and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least
1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum
forty-eight-hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always
withdraw runoff from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As
such, a skimmer discharge device consistent with Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development shall be provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall
also provide both a sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet
structure shall be constructed consistent with the specifications contained in
the latest edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
            When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used
as temporary sediment trapping SCMs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase
and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village.
            The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone. As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be
no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer.
            The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one
of the following methods:
         A.   Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1,000
ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.   Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with Revised Universal
Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) or other generally accepted erosion prediction
model.
            When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site
areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration
between the inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the owner must consider public
safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in
Table 1050.09.3  below. Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep
runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include
swales, dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to ten
acres.
 
Table 1050.09.3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  < 2%
0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in
Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the diameter of
filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter controls if
used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. The maximum contributing drainage area
shall not exceed one acre. Straw or hay bales and filter socks around catch
basins are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. SCMs must be
implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and that dust is
controlled. These SCMs must include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be
cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
               Based on site conditions, Village Engineer may require
additional stormwater control measures to control off site tracking and dust.
These additional SCMs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with division (g) of this
section.
         E.   Owners shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources and wetlands. A fifty foot undisturbed natural buffer
shall be provided around surface waters of the State unless infeasible. If it
is infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed fifty-foot natural buffer,
the SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in division (B)(1) of
this section for areas within fifty feet of a surface water or riparian
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the owner is permitted to disturb areas
within fifty feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All SCMs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural SCMs shall be designated and implemented on site to
protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from SCMs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls. No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The owner must
implement site stormwater control measures to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials. A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, dry wall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility natural resource or water of the
State is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of other wastewaters. The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the State is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110 percent of the volume of the
volume of the largest containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall
be provided to clean up spills. The SWP3 plan shall contain spill prevention
and response procedures and these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-
construction meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
Where construction activities are to occur on sites with contamination from
previous activities, operators shall be aware that concentrations of materials
that meet other criteria (i.e. not considered a hazardous waste, meeting
voluntary action program (VAP standards)) may still result in stormwater
discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality Standards. Such discharges are not
authorized by this code. Control measures which may be utilized to meet this
requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge;
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent stormwater from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
            The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building
materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Owners may also
reference the existence of other plans (i.e., spill prevention control and
countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, safety response plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning.
   (h)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours after any
storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per twenty-four hour period. The
inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire
site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions
(e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Village Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         The owner shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The owner shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village or an alternate form
acceptable to the Village Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.   Locations of.
            6.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               a.   SCMs that need to be maintained.
               b.   SCMs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               c.   Where additional SCMs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            7.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non- compliance determined by these inspections.
   (j)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All SCMs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment SCMs must be maintained in a functional condition until all up slope
areas they control reach final stabilization. The owner shall provide a
description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of SCMs and shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding
to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
         When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
      (1)   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (3)   When SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
owner may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement applies
to that portion of the site.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.10   ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.

diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development Manual.
      (3)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (4)   Street sweeping. Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (5)   Stabilization. The development area shall be stabilized as detailed

      (9)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.11   DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN (CSWMP).
   (a)   This regulation requires that a comprehensive stormwater management
plan be developed and implemented for all commercial and industrial site
development and all soil disturbing activities disturbing one or more acres of
total land, or less than one acre if part of a larger common plan of
development or sale disturbing one or more acres of total land, and on which
any regulated activity of Section
1050.01(d) is proposed. See Section

   (a)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Required. The owner shall
develop a comprehensive stormwater management plan describing how the quantity
and quality of stormwater will be managed after construction is complete for
every discharge from the site and/or into a water resource or small MS4. The
plan will illustrate the type, location, and dimensions of every structural and
non-structural stormwater management practice incorporated into the site
design, and the rationale for their selection. The rationale must address how
these SCMs will address flooding within the site as well as flooding that may
be caused by the development upstream and downstream of the site. The rationale
will also describe how the SCMs minimize impacts to the physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics of on-site and downstream water resources and, if
necessary, correct current degradation of water resources that is occurring or
take measures to prevent predictable degradation of water resources.
   (b)   Preparation by Professional Engineer. The comprehensive stormwater
management plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer and
include supporting calculations, plan sheets, and design details. To the extent
necessary, as determined by the Village Engineer, a site survey shall be
performed by a registered professional surveyor to establish boundary lines,
measurements, or land surfaces.
   (c)   Village Procedures. The Village Engineer shall prepare and maintain
procedures providing specific criteria and guidance to be followed when
designing the stormwater management system for the site. These procedures may
be updated from time to time, at the discretion of the Village Engineer based
on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring, and local maintenance
experience. The Village Engineer shall make the final determination of whether
the practices proposed in the comprehensive stormwater management plan meet the
requirements of this regulation. The Village Engineer may also maintain a list
of acceptable SCMs that meet the criteria of this regulation to be used in the
Village.

The applicant must provide a draft of this inspection and maintenance agreement
as part of the comprehensive stormwater management plan submittal. Once a draft
is approved, a recorded copy of the agreement must be submitted to the Village
to receive final inspection approval of the site.
         M.   Annual inspection. There will be an annual inspection of all SCMs
indicated in the CSWM. A SCM, in this case, shall be considered all stormwater
facilities used for the purpose of water quality as decided upon by the Village
Engineer. Examples of SCMs requiring annual inspections are wet ponds, dry
ponds, sand filters, bio-swales, and constructed wetlands. The Village Engineer
may require inspections to be performed more regularly if deemed necessary.

certified person (e.g., P.E., CESSWI, CPESC), as approved by the Village
Engineer, for annual stormwater inspections.
            2.   The Stormwater Inspector shall use the SCM checklist available
from the Village Engineer.
            3.   It is deemed a violation of this section if the Village does
not receive the annual inspection report before August 1 of each year. In such
an event, the Village has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
any inspections as necessary to verify that the SCMs are being operated and
maintained in accordance with this chapter and charge the responsible party
accordingly. Any accounts that are over thirty days delinquent may be certified
to the County Auditor, who shall then place the same on the tax duplicate of
the county, with interest as allowed by law, to be collected as taxes are
collected.
         N.   Annual report. Following the annual inspection, the landowner(s)
or organization shall submit an annual stormwater report to the Village

annual inspection and will be listed in the next annual stormwater report.
            3.   The Village is authorized to enter upon the property and to
perform the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the
landowner(s) or organization responsible for maintenance does not make the
required corrections in the specified time period. In addition to any other
penalty provided for in this chapter, the Village shall be reimbursed by the
landowner(s) or organization responsible for maintenance for all expenses
incurred within ten days of receipt of invoice from the Village.
      (11)   Calculations required. The owner shall submit calculations for
projected stormwater runoff flows, volumes, and timing into and through all
SCMs for flood control, channel protection, water quality, and the condition of

(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.14   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR CSWMP.
   (a)   Stormwater Design General Information. No person shall develop any
real property or connect or cause to be connected any building or other
structure, either directly or indirectly, with a drain for the removal of
surface, roof, ground or other water to be discharged into a ditch, swale,
waterway, stream or an existing storm drainage system for such real property,
without complying with the performance standards and paying the charges set
forth in this chapter.
   (b)   General. The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, twenty- four-hour storm event; to maintain
predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following
criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with
Chapter 1225 Riparian Setbacks.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village and Ohio EPA.
            SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional
criteria required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   SCMs designed for final use. SCMs shall be designed to achieve the
stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with the
proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots. Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined by the Village, shall provide stormwater management for
the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year,
twenty-four-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-
development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources. SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local agencies as
required in Section
1050.05 , and the activity is in compliance with erosion and sediment control
requirements of Sections
1050.06  through
1050.10  and all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater facilities in the floodplain. Stormwater facilities
constructed, manufactured or otherwise, that provide treatment of the water
quality volume, detention, retention, and/or infiltration, and all related
activities, shall not be constructed in any special flood hazard area, as
defined in
Chapter 1462  Flood Damage Prevention.
      (6)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels. All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, twenty-four-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance
channels, the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and
alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a
safe design.
      (7)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the site is part of a larger common
plan of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site
are provided by an existing SCM, or if the stormwater management requirements
for the site are provided by practices defined in a regional or local
stormwater management plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (8)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with
inspection and maintenance agreements approved by the Village Engineer as
detailed in Section
1050.13 .
      (9)   Agreements with sub-dividers or developers. A sub-divider or
developer shall be required to construct an on-site SCM for the purposes of
water quality and water retention approved by the Village Engineer. The
combination of stormwater quality and quantity requirements for two or more
developments may be placed into one detention basin to be located at a
strategic site given that a separate agreement with all parties is developed.
The Village shall enter into an agreement with the sub-divider or developer, to
be approved by Council, containing the following conditions:
         A.   The sub-divider of a major subdivision shall require the
formation of a homeowners' association, which shall assume responsibility for
all maintenance, upkeep, repair, replacement and management of the SCM. In
other developments, the sub-divider or developer shall make provisions
acceptable to the Village for maintenance of the SCM area as stated in Section
1050.17. Easements shall be granted to the Village for access to and
maintenance of the stormwater management area.
         B.   If more than one development is to use a single SCM, a separate
association of all members using that SCM shall be formed. This association
will be held responsible for all future maintenance and repairs of the SCM as
stated in this chapter.
         C.   The sub-divider or developer shall be exempt from the application
of this section only if authorized by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Where a sub-divider or developer is exempt from the provisions of
this section, that sub-divider or developer shall comply with and pay fees in
accordance with this chapter, governing subdivisions and development prior to
the effective date of this section.
         E.   All SCMs will be placed within blocks and/or easements to allow
Village access (see Section
1050.16).
      (10)   Preservation of existing natural drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining un-concentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream's physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (11)   Preservation of wetland hydrology. Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland(s) in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. SCMs such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration basins,
conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent streams,
depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the wetland
hydrology.
            If the owner proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
      (12)   Soil preservation and post-construction soil restoration. To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil orduff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of fifteen-
eighteen inches; 2. incorporate compost through top twelve inches; 3. Replace
with stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of four
inches.
   (c)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria. All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream/storm sewer discharge. The stormwater facility (storm sewer
main or natural watercourse) that will convey the discharge from the site shall
be analyzed to determine if it is capable of conveying the additional storm
sewer discharge from the site of a 100-year/twenty-four-hour storm. If the
designated outlet is not capable of conveying the discharge from the site
during the 100-year/twenty-four-hour storm, then additional storage must be
placed onsite to store the additional volume for a period of forty-eight hours.
      (2)   Surface water protection. The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the owner shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the
Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local
agencies as required in Section
1050.05 , and the activity is in compliance with Sections
1050.06  through
1050.10  and
Chapter 1225  Riparian Setbacks, all as determined by the Village Engineer. At
a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (3)   Off-site stormwater discharges. Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive stormwater management plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (4)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. Flow shall be
directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other stormwater management
practice from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Open channels. Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to stormwater management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the ten-year, twenty-
four-hour stormwater runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (6)   Drainage systems. Open drainage systems shall be preferred on all
new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer systems
shall be allowed to augment open drainage systems, such as to limit depth of
roadside or conveyance ditches. The following criteria shall be used to design
storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewer design flow shall be based on the rational method.
Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge from runoff
caused by the ten-year, twenty- four-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway, whichever
is more restrictive during a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm. The
system shall be designed to meet these requirements when conveying the flows
from the contributing area within the proposed development and existing flows
from offsite areas that are upstream from the development. These calculations
will be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer prior to design
acceptance. Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of the NOAA
Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per
Table 1. Runoff coefficients shall be per
Table 2.
Table 1 - Rainfall per Storm Frequency
24 Hour Storm (year) Rainfall (in.)
Table 1 - Rainfall per Storm Frequency
24 Hour Storm (year) Rainfall (in.)
2 (50% storm)        2.44

         B.   Rainfall intensity will be calculated using the equation i = a/
(t+b)c
            Where:
               i = Rainfall intensity (in./hour)
               t = Time of concentration (minutes)
            Refer to Ohio Department of Transportation's Location & Design
Manual, Volume 2 (or latest edition) Drainage Design, Figure 1101-2 for
Rainfall Intensity Constants (a, b & c). The maximum slope allowable shall be a
slope that produces no less than 2.5-fps and no more than a 10-fps velocity
within the pipe barrel under design flow conditions.
         C.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve inches.
         D.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
            1.   Previous studies on file with the Village.
            2.   FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
            3.   Calculations prepared by a registered professional engineer.
         E.   Catch basin design spread calculations shall be submitted to the
Village Engineer for review to determine catch basin spacing and sizing. At a
minimum, there shall be at least one total clear lane during a twenty-five
year, twenty-four-hour storm.
         F.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Outlets discharging into an open-water conveyance structure shall
have an invert at a minimum of three inches above the average water depth
during the snow-melt season.
         I.   The flood elevation for a 100 year, twenty-four-hour storm must
be a minimum of ten feet away horizontally from the perimeter of any homes
within the new subdivision, nor cause any home flooding to adjacent neighboring
properties, and shall be at least two feet below the finished grade elevation
of any livable structure.
         J.   All storm sewer outlets from a subdivision must flow either into
a public storm sewer, stream of the State, or a major ditch unless authorized
by the Village Engineer.
         K.   The maximum distance for sheet flow shall be 300 feet before
entering a storm structure. Except, that the maximum overland drainage area
tributary to the storm structure shall be no greater than one and one-half
acres.
      (7)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum twenty-five year, twenty-four-hour
storm or as indicated by the Village Engineer. The maximum allowed headwater
for such a storm shall be twelve inches below pavement crown elevation. Water
crossings carrying receiving waters located near upstream Village borders shall
convey no more flow than currently designed to carry unless directed by the
Village Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all exceptional warmwater
habitat, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the twenty-five-year storm under these
conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
twenty-four-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (8)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm event to an
adequate receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained
within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause
flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface
elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the
finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood routing
paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (9)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation. In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. First consideration
for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (10)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Stormwater Quality Control.
      (1)   Direct runoff to a SCM. The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following SCMs. These SCMs are listed in Table 4 of this
regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general performance
standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
         C.   For sites disturbing less than five acres, but greater than one
acre and not part of a common plan of development or sale, where five or more
acres are disturbed, the Village Engineer may approve other SCM's if the owner
demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation.
         D.   For sites disturbing five or more acres, or less than five acres
but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five
or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCM's if the owner
demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCM's meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section 1223.09(c)(6), and has prior
written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         E.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the State, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCM's not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Departments of Transportations "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
         F.   The Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the owner
demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1050.14(c)(4).
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
                  P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A = area draining into the SCM, in acres.
               Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume
are listed in
Table 1050.14.1. Alternatively, the Village Engineer may consider use of the
following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient if the applicant can
demonstrate that appropriate controls are in place to limit the proposed
impervious area of the development:
               C = 0.858i3-0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1050.14.1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & commercial                            0.8
High density residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium density residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low density residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open space and recreational areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is low density residential, 30% is
high density residential, and 10% is open space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6) (0.3) + (0.3) (0.5) + (0.1) (0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to twenty percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the SCM for sediment storage. This volume shall be
incorporated into the sections of SCMs where pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   SCMs for quality shall be designed such that the drain time is
long enough to provide treatment and protect against downstream bank erosion,
but short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall events as
defined in
Table 1050.14.2.
         E.   All wet or dry extended stormwater detention facilities shall
have a forebay and micropool as per the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.

   Sand and other media filtration5             24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
         F.   Each SCM shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
         G.   The seasonal high groundwater elevation is the normal water line
or normal elevation of saturation.
         H.   Water quality volume (WQv) orifices less than three-inches in
diameter shall be designed with an anti-clogging or non-clogging design.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility have an infiltration rate between 0.5 in./hr. and 4.0 in./hr. (or
deemed acceptable by the Village Engineer), if the seasonal high water table is
at least three feet below the final grade elevation, and any underlying bedrock
is at least six feet below the final grade elevation. Infiltration trenches
should be designed to meet all criteria in the current edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than three feet below the final grade
elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a two and one-half foot deep layer of soil amendment with a
permeability equivalent to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is
provided.
         B.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or diffuse
flow using a plunge pool, flow diffuser or level spreader, before entering an
extended conveyance facility.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than one-third of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4-3:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than four
feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least eight feet
and no more than fifteen feet outward from the normal water edge. The eight
feet wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an
average depth of six inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of
aquatic vegetation. The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than
fifteen inches below the permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to
individuals who accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to limit
growth of dense vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito predators
to pass through the vegetation. The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be
ten (H) to one (V). The aquatic bench shall be planted with hearty plants
comparable to wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged
inundation. The use of invasive species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay volume shall be equal to at
least ten percent of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (6)   Criteria for the acceptance of alternative post-construction SCMs.
The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 5. If the site is greater than five acres, or less than five
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To
demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of eighty percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than five percent of the water area upstream of
the development site, unless a TMDL has identified water quality problems in
the receiving surface water of the State.
   (e)   Stormwater Quantity Control. The comprehensive stormwater management
plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one-year, twenty-four-hour
storm occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-development
conditions.
      (2)   Developers or sub-dividers shall include in their preliminary plans
a local watershed study to determine the impact from the development or
subdivision caused by stormwater onto the lands adjoining or downstream from
the area to be developed, to assure that said lands shall not be adversely
affected by the proposed development or subdivision.
      (3)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm shall have peak
runoff discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent
size storms under pre-development conditions. The 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25- , 50-,
and 100-year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (4)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the Village
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a one-year, twenty-four-
hour storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after
development. These calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.   Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of the
NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1 which ever is greater.
            5.   Temporal distribution. Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use. Curve numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1 and 9-5.
               a.   Post-development curve numbers. All areas that are altered
by construction practices shall use post-construction hydraulic soil groups
from Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
            7.   Time of concentration. Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
            8.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic
model acceptable to the Village Engineer.
            9.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in Section 1223.09(d)(3)A.,
determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using
the percentage, select the twenty- four-hour critical storm from Table 5.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
1050.14(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the twenty- four-hour critical storm
from
Table 1050.14.3.
Table 1050.14.3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
Table 1050.14.3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is: The critical
Equal to or greater than: and less than:              storm will be:

----                      10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ___                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
         C.   For sites with less than one acre of disturbed land and not part
of a common plan of development:
            1.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is less than
110 percent of the pre-developed critical storm flow, no stormwater quantity
measures need to be implemented.
            2.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is equal to
or greater than 110 percent of the pre-developed critical storm, stormwater
quantity measures need to be implemented so that the post-developed critical
storm flow is less than the pre-developed critical storm flow
   (f)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects. Comprehensive
stormwater management plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing
site impervious areas by at least twenty percent. A one-for-one credit towards
the twenty percent net reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the
use of pervious pavement and/or green roofs.
      (1)   Where site conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area,
SCMs shall be implemented to at least twenty percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a twenty percent net reduction of
the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least twenty percent of
the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at twenty percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section 1223.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.15   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS FOR CSWMPS.
   (a)   When the Village determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same hydrologic unit code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Section
1050.18 is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village to be applied to
community-wide stormwater management practices.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
SCM to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.16   EASEMENTS FOR CSWMPS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the inspection and maintenance
agreement submitted with the comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Auditor and on all
property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than twenty-five-
feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an
additional twenty-five-foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCMs.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading
and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the
Village at the property owners' expense.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.17   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL OF CSWMP.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the Village Engineer and per
the approved comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   An as-built certification, including as-built survey and inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer and a professional
surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the comprehensive stormwater management plan approved
by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the Village Engineer
may require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if he/she
determines that the design was altered significantly from the approved
comprehensive stormwater management plan. The as-built survey must provide the
location, dimensions, and bearing of such SCMs and include the entity
responsible for long-term maintenance as detailed in the inspection and
maintenance agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded inspection and maintenance
agreement as specified in Section
1050.13 must be provided to the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.18   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS OF CSWMPS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the inspection and
maintenance plan and inspection and maintenance agreement. The Village has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the Village shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the inspection
and maintenance agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have ten working days, or other mutually agreed upon
time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and
established timelines. Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan
approved by the Village Engineer for these repairs not be in place, the Village
may undertake the necessary repairs and assess all costs to the responsible
party.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.19   FEES.
   The stormwater pollution prevention plan, abbreviated stormwater pollution
plan and comprehensive stormwater management plan review, filing, and
inspection fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted
to the Village before the review process begins. The Village Engineer shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services. Please consult with the Village Engineer for the current fee
schedule.
Note: Regarding erosion and sediment control plans, one municipality requires
the posting of a fee reserve balance, which the Village Engineer draws from
over the life of a project to cover costs associated with reviews and
inspections. When this balance falls below thirty-five percent of its original
amount, the applicant may be required to make an additional deposit. Another
municipality currently assesses a three hundred dollar ($300.00) fee for all
abbreviated SWP3 submittals. Fees should account for a minimum of two site
inspections for each month the site is active. The minimum recommended fee is
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.20   BOND.
   (a)   If a stormwater pollution prevention plan or abbreviated stormwater
pollution prevention plan is required by this regulation, soil-disturbing
activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond has been deposited with the
Community Finance Department. The bond amount shall be a one thousand five
hundred dollar ($1,500) minimum, and an additional one thousand five hundred
dollars ($1,500) paid for each subsequent acre or fraction thereof. The bond
will be used for the Village to perform the obligations otherwise to be
performed by the owner of the development area as stated in this regulation and
to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event that the applicant
fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The cash bond shall be
returned, less Village administrative fees as detailed in this chapter, after
all work required by this regulation has been completed and final stabilization
has been reached, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without a SWP3 or
abbreviated SWP3 approved by the Village Engineer.
   (c)   If a comprehensive stormwater management plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of five percent of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village
Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less Village administrative
fees as detailed in this chapter, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After eighty percent of the lots of the project have been complete
or 100 percent of the total project has been permanently stabilized or two
years from the time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An as built inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Village Engineer and a final letter of acceptance indicating the
practices have been properly constructed in accordance with the approved plan.
      (3)   An inspection and maintenance agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners association
who will take long-term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the
Village Engineer.
   (d)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.21   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY SCMS.
   The owner may not direct runoff through any water quality structures, or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these SCMs must be
stabilized within two days.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.22   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   All development areas under active construction may be subject to
external inspections by the Village to ensure compliance with the approved SWP3
or abbreviated SWP3.
   (b)   After each external inspection, the Village shall prepare and
distribute a status report to the applicant.
   (c)   If an external inspection determines that operations are being
conducted in violation of the approved SWP3 or abbreviated SWP3, the Village
may take action as detailed in Section
1050.23.
   (d)   All costs associated with such inspections shall be the responsibility
of the applicant and will be deducted from the fee reserve balance posted with
the Finance Department.
Note: Effective control of pollutants from construction sites demands that on-
site personnel work proactively. In other words, the site must be prepared to
handle the problem before the problem comes about. Even though SCMs are erected
at the beginning of projects, all too often their initial construction is
incorrect, thereby rendering many SCMs ineffective at the time they are needed
the most. By the time on-site personnel react to the failing SCMs, it is likely
a significant amount of sediment has already been conveyed off-site. Brooklyn
Heights should consider a requirement to have all structural SCMs inspected by
a qualified representative of the Village as they are being constructed to
ensure they meet minimum standards. This would eliminate many of the
"violations" noted within inspection reports, and help to accomplish the
overall goal-keeping pollutants on site.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.23   VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated
any of the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation.
   (b)   Upon notice, the Building Official may suspend any active soil
disturbing activity for a period not to exceed ninety days, and may require
immediate erosion and sediment control measures whenever he or she determines
that such activity is not meeting the intent of this regulation. Such notice
shall be in writing, shall be given to the applicant, and shall state the
conditions under which work may be resumed. In instances, however, where the
Building Official finds that immediate action is necessary for public safety or
the public interest, he or she may require that work be stopped upon verbal
order pending issuance of the written notice.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.24   APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the Village in relation to this regulation may appeal to
the court of common pleas. Such an appeal shall be made in conformity with the
Ohio Revised Code. Written notice of appeal shall be served on the Village.
(Ord. 63-2017. Passed 12-5-17.)
1050.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity or corporation; including but not limited to,
the owner of the property, his agents and assigns, occupant, property manager,
and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and
shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for no
more than sixty days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Village instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court
of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to restrain,
correct, or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of
this regulation or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations, or
the orders of the Village.
   (c)   All expenses incurred by the community to initiate an enforcement
action, implement a mitigating event, remediate damages caused or resolve a
violation shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be deducted
from any funds or bonds on file with the Finance Department.

Clerk/Treasurer shall not be required to receive any applications until May 1

those received thereafter shall be processed by the Clerk/Treasurer in the
order of their receipt. If an application is received for a period for which
the quota of the park has been reached and a different period then and there
cannot be substituted, then such application shall be deemed withdrawn so that
other applications can be processed. The members of such a group under such a
permit shall be entitled to use such recreational facilities only so long as
the permittee remains with such group in the park, and such permittee shall be
responsible at all times for the conduct of the group and for any damage done
to any of the recreational facilities through misuse.

use of the public parks and the facilities therein or to protect and preserve
such parks and facilities.

1225.01   PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the Village contributes to the health, safety, and
general welfare of the residents of the Village. The specific purpose and
intent of these regulations is to regulate uses and developments within
riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating based flow;
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks;
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses;
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses;
      (5)   Provide high quality watercourse habitats with shade and food;
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system;
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation;
      (8)   Benefit the Village economically by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions, such as
dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and environment of the Village, and therefore preserving the
character of the Village, the quality of life of the residents of the Village,
and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and
uses in riparian setbacks.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.02   APPLICABILITY, COMPLIANCE AND VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   These regulations shall apply to all lands that are within the
jurisdiction of the Village and that border designated watercourses as defined
in these regulations.
   (b)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Village without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations where applicable.
   (c)   Any person who shall violate any section of these regulations shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be subject to punishment as provided in
Chapter 698 of these Codified Ordinances and shall be required to restore the
riparian area through a restoration plan approved by the Village.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.03   CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS; SEVERABILITY.
   (a)   Where these regulations impose a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract, or
deed, the provisions of these regulations shall control.
   (b)   These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of other
provisions of law, regulation, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in division (a) of this section.
   (c)   If any clause, section, or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)

(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   Riparian setbacks are established as follows:
      (1)   75 feet on either side of the main stem of West Creek as depicted
on attachment A attached to Ordinance 22-02;
      (2)   75 feet on either side of tributary streams of West Creek as
depicted on attachment A attached to Ordinance 22-02;
      (3)   300 fee on either side of the Cuyahoga River as depicted on
attachment A attached to Ordinance 22-02.
   (b)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian setbacks shall be measured in a horizontal direction
outwards from the ordinary high water mark of each watercourse.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, riparian
setbacks shall be preserved in their natural states.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a watercourse, the riparian setback shall be extended
to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA or a site-specific floodplain delineation in conformance with
standard engineering practices and approved by the Zoning Inspector.
      (4)   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
riparian setback shall consist of the full extent of the wetland plus a 50-foot
minimum setback extending beyond the outer boundary of these wetlands. Wetlands
shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the Zoning Inspector using
delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the time
of application of these regulations. All wetland delineations shall also
include the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland
evaluation approved at the time of application of these regulations.
   (c)   The developer or applicant, or designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian setbacks, including any expansions or
modifications as required by divisions (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, and
identifying these setbacks on all subdivisions, land development plans, and/or
building permit applications submitted to the Zoning Inspector. This
delineation shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plan or
at the time of submission of any permit applications. This delineation shall be
done through a metes and bounds survey and shall be subject to review and
approval by the Zoning Inspector. As the result of this review, the Zoning
Inspector may require further studies from the developer, applicant, or
designated representative.
   (d)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, riparian setbacks shall be
clearly delineated by the landowner on-site, and such delineation shall be
maintained throughout soil disturbing activities.
   (e)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector prior
to delineation of riparian setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat
records for the Village.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.06   PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   By-Right Uses Without a Permit. Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in riparian setbacks, including but not limited to
those listed in divisions (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section. No use permitted
under these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately
held lands.
      (1)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, State, and local laws, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, picnicking,
and similar uses.
      (2)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed. Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than six inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into
sections no longer than six feet, anchored to the shore, or removed from the
100-year flood plain.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of riparian areas shall be allowed without approval of the Zoning
Inspector. Appendix A attached to Ordinance 22-02 lists species of shrubs and
vines recommended for stabilizing flood prone areas of the West Creek
watershed.
   (b)   By-Right Uses With a Permit.
      (1)   Stream bank Stabilization/Erosion Control Measures. Stream bank
stabilization/ erosion control measures may be allowed, provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical and available. Such stream
bank stabilization/erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of an Erosion Control Plan by the Zoning Inspector. In reviewing this
plan, the Zoning Inspector may consult with a representative of the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas and Preserves, Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water, Cuyahoga Soil and
Water Conservation District, or other technical experts as necessary.
      (2)   Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses through riparian
setbacks by publicly- owned sewer and/or water lines and public utility
transmission lines may only be allowed upon approval of a Crossing Plan by the
Zoning Inspector. Such crossings shall minimize disturbance to riparian areas
and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances. In reviewing this plan, the
Zoning Inspector may consult with a representative of the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas and Preserves, Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water, Cuyahoga Soil and Water
Conservation District, or other technical experts as necessary.
      (3)   Multi-Purpose Trail. Right-of-way and construction of multi-purpose
trails for recreational purposes only and not to exceed ten feet in width,
constructed of either a porous or non- porous surface may be allowed upon
approval of Council.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.07   PROHIBITED USES.
   Any use not authorized under these regulations shall be prohibited in
riparian setbacks. By way of example, the following uses are specifically
prohibited; however, prohibited uses are not limited to those examples listed
here:
   (a)   Construction. There shall be no structures of any kind.
   (b)   Dredging or Dumping. There shall be no drilling, filling, dredging, or
dumping of soil, spoils, liquid, or solid materials, except for noncommercial
composting of uncontaminated natural materials and except as permitted under
Section
1225.06.
   (c)   Roads or Driveways. There shall be no roads or driveways, except as
permitted under Section
1225.06 of these regulations.
   (d)   Motorized Vehicles. There shall be no use of motorized vehicles,
except as permitted under Section
1225.06 of these regulations.
   (e)   Disturbance of Natural Vegetation. There shall be no disturbance of
the natural vegetation, except for such conservation maintenance that the
landowner deems necessary to control noxious weeds, for such plantings as are
consistent with these regulations, for such disturbances as are approved under
Section
1225.06 of these regulations, and for the passive enjoyment, access, and
maintenance of landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these
regulations. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
landowner to plant or undertake any other activities in riparian setbacks,
provided the landowner allows for natural succession.
   (f)   Parking Lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human-made
impervious cover, except as permitted under Section
1225.06 of these regulations.
   (g)   New Surface and/or Subsurface Sewage Disposal or Treatment Areas.
Riparian areas shall not be used for the disposal or treatment of sewage,
except in accordance with Cuyahoga County Board of Health regulations at the
time of application of these regulations.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.08   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES.
   Nonconforming structures or uses in riparian setbacks shall be regulated
under the provisions of Section 1286 of these Codified Ordinances. Where the
following language is more restrictive than Section 1286, the following
language shall prevail:
   (a)   A nonconforming use, existing at the time of passage of these
regulations and within a riparian setback, that is not permitted under these
regulations may be continued but shall not be changed or enlarged unless
changed to a use permitted under these regulations.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure, existing at the time of passage of these
regulations and within a riparian setback, that is not permitted under these
regulations may be continued but shall not have the existing building footprint
or roofline expanded or enlarged.
   (c)   A nonconforming structure or use, existing at the time of passage of
these regulations and within a riparian setback, that has substantial damage
and which is discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a period of six months
or more may not be revived, restored, or re-established.
(Ord. 22-02. Passed 4-2-02.)
1225.09   VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Village may grant a variance to these regulations provided herein
in cases where practical difficulties in the use of the property are imposed by
these regulations and the need for requested relief outweighs the potential
harm or reduction in riparian area functions which may be caused by a proposed
use.
   (b)   In making a determination under division (a) of this section, the
Village should consider the following factors:
      (1)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year flood plain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, and other functions of the
riparian area. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the landowner and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback should
be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent possible and to include best
management practices necessary to minimize erosion and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover in the riparian
setback compromises its benefits to the Village. Variances should not be
granted for asphalt or concrete paving within the riparian setback. Variances
may be granted for gravel driveways.

and conditions set forth in
Chapter 1244.
   (c)   When the street improvements set forth in subsection (b) hereof have
been installed to the satisfaction and meeting the approval of the Engineer,
then, upon his or her certification that they have been so installed in
accordance with the requirements herein set forth, in accordance with the
latest standard plans and specifications and in accordance with the established
grade, the Council, finding the same to have been so installed, will approve
the plat and accept the dedication of the streets shown on such plat.
(Ord. 61-58. Passed 10-7-58.)
1242.11   RECORDING OF PLAT.

1244.01   STREET DESIGN.
   (a)   The location and widths of proposed streets shall be such as to fit in
with any plan of street development adopted by the Village Planning Commission
or other public authority. Due regard shall be given to existing streets or
streets capable of being established on surrounding property so that streets
may be laid out through adjacent or neighboring allotments with reasonable
continuity of location and width.
   (b)   In order that proposed streets may be as nearly co-terminus as
possible with existing streets in adjoining allotments, due provision shall be
made for the direct continuation of all existing streets which extend to the
boundaries of the proposed allotment. In case adjacent allotments are separated
by existing thoroughfares, due provision shall be made for continuing, in a
practical manner, such of the existing streets through the proposed allotment
as may be necessary for public requirements, subject to the approval of the
Council.
   (c)   Where the land for a proposed allotment adjoins unallotted property
that is capable of being allotted, then the streets in such proposed allotment
need only be carried to the boundaries thereof.
(1974 Code § 153.02(H))
1244.02   STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   The minimum width of any proposed street shall be sixty feet. At the
intersection of streets, the rounding of corners is required, with minimum
radii of twenty feet, unless otherwise permitted at angular intersections.
   (b)   Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, may require
wider streets than sixty feet, whenever, in its judgment, provision for public
travel makes the wider streets desirable, or whenever any general plan for
street development adopted by the Planning Commission requires, or Council
requests, the establishment of streets of greater width.
   (c)   No so-called dead-end streets will be approved for dedication except
where conditions make the extension of such streets impracticable. In such
cases, a dead-end street may be approved, provided that adequate turning space
for vehicles is placed at the dead-end.
   (d)   Turning space shall be of sufficient size to provide for a paved
circular roadway at least twenty feet in width, the inside radius of which
shall be at least 35 feet.
   (e)   Dead-end streets in developments shall be extended:
      (1)   Through the development to a point within 300 feet of its furthest
extremity; or
      (2)   Where a topographical irregularity exists, to a point which shall
be no less than 300 feet, measured from the center of the turn-around to the
topographical irregularity.
   (f)   Intersecting streets shall be provided so that no block will be longer
than 1,500 feet.
(1974 Code § 153.02(I))
1244.03   FRONTAGE AND LOT AREA.

Council and filed with the Clerk/Treasurer, depending on the availability of
the facilities therefor and under the following conditions:
      (1)   Where water mains and sanitary sewer facilities are not available,
storm sewers adequate for the drainage of the street and the lots fronting
thereon and the natural drainage intercepted by said street must be installed.
Evidence must be furnished to the Engineer and the Council that adequate water
supply means and sewer outlet means meeting with the approval of the Engineer,
the Council and the public health authorities are provided for each of the lots
of the subdivision.
      (2)   Where water main facilities are available to the subdivision, water
mains meeting the approval of the City of Cleveland Division of Water and the
Engineer, together with curb connections for each lot in said subdivision, must
be installed.
      (3)   Where sanitary facilities are available to the subdivision,
sanitary sewers, together with curb connections for each lot, must be
installed. Such sanitary facilities must be first approved by the Engineer and
any other authority having jurisdiction in such matter. Curb connections also
must be installed for storm sewers for each lot when sanitary sewers are
installed.
   (b)   When such sewers and water mains have been installed satisfactory to
and meeting the approval of the Engineer, then, upon his or her certification
that the same have been installed in accordance with the requirements herein
set forth, the Council, finding the same to have been so installed, will
approve such installation and will approve the plat for record purposes only.
   (c)   In cases of sewer installations, storm or sanitary, before the
Engineer shall be required to issue said certificate or the Council to approve
such installation, and to enable the Engineer and Council to be satisfied that
such sewer is free and clear of all foreign substance and there is nothing
present to prevent the free flow of sewage and/or storm water, the allotter or
the contractor installing the sewer system shall cause to be made photographs
of the entire sewerage system so installed, thereby showing that the sewerage
system has been constructed upon sound engineering bases and free from defects,
that the sewerage system is free of any and all accumulations of foreign
substances, and that the passage and flow of sewage and/or storm water will be
free, clear and unobstructed. Such photographs shall be delivered to the
Engineer, who shall file the same with his or her certificate, and become the
property of the Village. If, in the discretion of the Engineer, the sewers are
large enough for a visual inspection to be made, in lieu of photographs, such
visual inspection shall be made and a report of such inspection shall accompany
the Engineer's certification.
   (d)   The cost of such photographs, photographing and/or visual inspection
shall be solely at the expense of the allotter or the contractor installing
such sewerage system.

1244.05   PERMANENT PAVEMENT.
   (a)   Permanent pavement shall be constructed in accordance with the latest
standard plans and specifications prepared by the Engineer, approved by the
Council and filed with the Clerk/Treasurer.

permits prior to the installation of the permanent pavement, then a temporary
or partial pavement shall be built in accordance with the pertinent provisions
of such standard plans and specifications in order to assure access to any
building for any of the Village equipment of the Fire, Police and Service
Departments, and the same shall be maintained to the satisfaction of the
Service Department. Should the same be not so maintained, then future permits
will be denied and permits issued shall be revoked.

   All culverts and bridges necessary within the limits of the streets to be
dedicated, all box culverts and drainage necessary to carry surface drainage,
and all of the work necessary in the intersections of the proposed streets,
with existing streets, including the repaving of such intersections, and
providing catch basins at such locations, shall be done by the owner of the
proposed development, or land proposed for dedication, and all to the approval
and satisfaction of the Engineer.
(Ord. 61-58. Passed 10-7-58.)
1244.09   MONUMENTS.

   This Title Six of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances shall be
designated and known as the “Zoning Code of the Village of Brooklyn Heights.”
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1260.02   PURPOSE.
   The general purpose of this Zoning Code is to promote and protect the public
health, safety, peace, prosperity and general welfare of the Village as a whole
by regulating the uses of land and of buildings, regulating the area and
dimensions of land, yards and open spaces, regulating the bulk, height, size,
design and locations of buildings, regulating the density of population to land
area, regulating the intensity of a land use, and regulating building setback
lines, and, for the aforesaid purposes, to divide the Village into zones or
districts of such number and dimensions that discourage a pyramidal structure
and are in accordance with the development objectives of the Village's
Comprehensive Plan. By these regulations, it is intended to promote and protect
land and building values, bring about the proper social and economic stability
of neighborhoods, minimize conflicts in the uses of land and buildings, and
protect and stabilize the character of a neighborhood.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1260.03   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Hereafter in the Village, no land shall be used or occupied and no structure
shall be constructed, erected, moved, repaired, structurally altered, enlarged,
or leased for any purpose except as permitted by this Zoning Code and in
conformity with the regulations herein established for the district in which
such land or structure is located.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1260.04   INTERPRETATION.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, the Village
officials vested with the administration of this Code shall be held to the
requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience, and general welfare. Except as specifically provided herein, it is
not intended by this Zoning Code to repeal, abrogate, or annul any existing
provision of law or ordinance or any rule or regulation previously adopted and
issued pursuant to law relating to the construction and use of buildings and
premises, nor any permit, license, certificate or other authorization
previously issued. It is not intended by this Zoning Code to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any private easements, covenants, agreements, or
restrictions, except in cases in which this Zoning Code imposes greater
restrictions upon the size or location of buildings or upon the use of land, or
requires larger lots, yards, open spaces, or setback lines than are otherwise
required or imposed. In such cases, the provisions of this Zoning Code shall
hold.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1260.05   AMENDMENTS.
   The text or map of this Zoning Code may be amended by the Council in
accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, or where applicable,
in accordance with the “Home Rule” provision of the Constitution of the State
of Ohio.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1260.06   SEPARABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that the several
provisions of this Zoning Code shall be separable, in accordance with the
provisions set forth below:
   (a)   If any provision of this Code is declared to be invalid by a decision
of any court of competent jurisdiction, the effect of such decision shall be
limited to that provision or provisions which are expressly stated in the
decision to be invalid. Such decision shall not affect, impair, or nullify this
Code as a whole or any other part thereof, and all other provisions of this
Code shall continue to be separate and fully in force and effect.
   (b)   If the application of any provision of this Code to any zoning lot,
building, or other structure is declared to be invalid by a decision of any
court of competent jurisdiction, the effect of such decision shall be limited
to that zoning lot, building, or other structure immediately involved in the
controversy, action or proceeding in which the judgment or decree of invalidity
is rendered. Such decision shall not affect, impair or nullify this Code as a
whole or the application of any provision thereof to any other zoning lot,
building, or other structure.

in the office of the Building Inspector, and shall be open to the public.
      (5)   Violations of conditions. Upon the serving of notice of any
violation of said provisions or conditions, the certificate of occupancy shall

1264.06   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEALS AND APPLICATIONS.

An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals must be filed with the Building
Inspector within fifteen days after a ruling of denial, reversal, or

papers, charts, maps and schedules which he or she deems the Board may require
to properly understand the nature of the application. The Board shall not be
required to hear the appeal or application until the necessary materials have
been provided. Failure to provide such materials due to neglect or refusal of
the applicant may result in the dismissal of the appeal or application.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1264.07   STANDARDS FOR THE GRANTING OF VARIANCES, CONDITIONAL USES, SIMILAR
USES, AND CHANGED NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (a)   In General. To authorize a variance from the terms of this Zoning
Code, and to grant a conditional use, similar use, or changed nonconforming
use, the Board of Zoning Appeals must determine the following:
      (1)   That the granting of the variance will not be contrary to the
general purpose, intent, and objective of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, moral and general welfare;
      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not harmfully affect the
property or rights of adjacent property owners or future development of the
neighborhood in which the variance is requested; and
      (4)   That the reasons for requesting the variance more than outweigh the
reason for holding to the strict letter of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Failure to Comply With Terms and Conditions. A written complaint by a
public official or private citizen can be filed with the Building Inspector
concerning the breach of any terms, conditions, or provisions required by the
Board of Zoning Appeals in the granting of any variance, conditional use,
similar use, or changed nonconforming use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
hold a public meeting after giving the user ten days written notice of such
complaint, as well as the date, time, and place of the hearing, and a copy of
this section of this Zoning Code. If the Board determines at the meeting that
the user has substantially failed and neglected to comply with the terms and
conditions set, then such use under the variance, conditional use, similar use,
or changed nonconforming use shall cease and be forfeited, and any future use
shall be unlawful under this chapter. The person aggrieved by such
determination of the Board shall have the right to appeal to the courts.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1264.08   GRANTING OF VARIANCES.
   (a)   Authority of Board of Zoning Appeals. When granting a variance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to do the following:
      (1)   Vary the yard or height regulations for a permitted principal or
accessory building or structure where there is an exceptional or unusual
physical condition of a lot when the condition is not generally prevalent in
the neighborhood and which, when related to the yard regulations of this Zoning
Code, would prevent a reasonable arrangement of buildings on the lot.
      (2)   Vary the lot area or width requirements where there is an
exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot, when the condition is
generally not prevalent in the neighborhood.
      (3)   Vary the sign regulations where the topography or existing
buildings interfere with the usual visibility under such conditions.
      (4)   Vary the location of garages in residential districts due to
unusual conditions of the topography, grade, and available maneuvering space.
      (5)   Vary the applicable off-street parking requirement established in
Chapter 1282 when there are exceptional or unusual circumstances that result in
practical difficulty in complying with the requirements.
      (6)   Vary other terms of this Zoning Code when given the authority to do
so in any section of this Code.
   (b)   Time Limits. The Board of Zoning Appeals may limit the time in which a
granted variance will remain valid and stipulate that the variance will be
unlawful upon the expiration of such time, but no variance shall remain valid
for more than one year from the date of approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals. After expiration of such a time limit, an application for a new
variance may be made in the same manner as the original. The Board shall take
the changed characteristics of the neighborhood into consideration when
reviewing the new variance.
   (c)   Terms and Conditions. The Board may attach terms and conditions to the
granted variance as may be reasonable for the health, safety, and welfare of
the neighborhood. Such terms and conditions may consist of:
      (1)   Installation of devices for stifling noise, dirt, smoke, odors and
other factors harmful to the neighborhood;
      (2)   Installation of fences, hedges, shrubs, or other shielding devices
and the installation of bumper guards for automobiles;
      (3)   Restriction or elimination of a use incident to the main use, such
as illumination or advertisement signs;
      (4)   Restriction of the variance to certain periods of the day or to
certain seasons of the year; and
      (5)   Such other terms and conditions as may be necessary.
   In order to secure the fulfillment of such terms and conditions, the Board
may rule that a variance cease upon breach of such conditions, or the Board may
require a safety bond, in an amount to be decided by the Board, to insure their
fulfillment.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94; Ord. 68-00. Passed 7-11-00.)
1264.09   GRANTING OF A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (a)   No conditional use shall be granted unless:
      (1)   The proposed use be properly located in relation to any adopted
plan of land use, major thoroughfares, or secondary or local streets, for the
surrounding area.
      (2)   The proposed use generates a minimum of vehicular traffic through
residential neighborhoods when located on a local street.
      (3)   The proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding residential
area, which cannot be served by the same use permitted in a nearby less
restricted district.
      (4)   The location, design, and operation of such conditional use will
not adversely affect a surrounding residential area.
      (5)   The conditional use is necessary to serve the community needs where
existing similar facilities in less restricted districts has proven inadequate.
      (6)   The conditional use will not create any dust, smoke, fumes, glare,
noxious odors, vibrations or other influences that would unreasonably and
adversely affect adjacent properties.
      (7)   The hours of operation and the concentration of vehicles in
connection with the conditional use will not unreasonably and adversely affect
adjacent properties.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may attach terms and conditions to the
granting of a conditional use and may require a bond for their fulfillment as
is regulated for the granting of variances in Section
1264.08.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1264.10   GRANTING OF A SIMILAR USE.
   (a)   No similar use shall be granted unless:
      (1)   A majority of the basic characteristics of the similar use conform
to a majority of the basic characteristics of the uses listed in the district
to which the use is to be added.
      (2)   The similar use does not create a danger to health, safety, and
welfare, and does not create offensive noise, vibration, dust, fumes, smoke,
odor, glare or other objectional influences to an extent greater than normally
resulting from other uses listed in the district to which it is to be added.
      (3)   The similar use does not create traffic to a greater extent than
the listed uses in the district to which it is to be added.
   (b)   A similar use granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject
to the same regulations and conditions provided for any applicable use in the
district in which it is located. Variances from the regulations of the district
in which the use is located must be applied for separately. In such cases, the
Board may grant the similar use and deny or grant the variance. Where a similar
use application is denied, the jurisdiction of the Board ceases and no variance
shall be granted unless a formal application is filed with the Building
Inspector.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)
1264.11   GRANTING OF A CHANGED NONCONFORMING USE.
   (a)   No changed nonconforming use shall be granted unless:
      (1)   A majority of the basic characteristics of the changed
nonconforming use conform to a majority of the basic characteristics of the old
nonconforming use.
      (2)   The changed nonconforming use does not create a danger to health,
safety, and welfare and does not create offensive noise, vibration, dust,
fumes, smoke, odor, glare or other objectional influences to an extent greater
than normally created by the old nonconforming use.
      (3)   The changed nonconforming use does not create traffic to a greater
extent than the old nonconforming use.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may attach terms, conditions and time
limits to the granting of a changed nonconforming use and may require a bond
for their fulfillment as is regulated for the granting of variances in Section
1264.08.

with the objectives of the residential plan to avoid congestion and to maintain
adequate services;

noises, invasion of abnormal vehicular traffic and other objectionable
influences; and
   (d)   To protect the desirable characteristics of existing residential
development, the promotion of stability, the most desirable and beneficial use
of the land, and bringing about the eventual conformity with the adopted or
officially accepted Comprehensive Plan and other plans of the Village.
(Ord. 73-94. Passed 10-4-94.)

1268.03   CONDITIONAL USES.
   Because of their uncommon characteristics, infrequent occurrences, large

1288.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Lattice” means a framework or structure of crossed metal strips or
struts and braces constructed vertically in the form of a triangle or square
which tapers from the foundation to the top.
   (b)   “Monopole” means a single, slender and typically cylindrical, vertical
structure to which antennas or antenna support structures are affixed.
   (c)   “Technically suitable” means the location of a wireless
telecommunications antenna which reasonably serves the purpose for which it is
intended within the band width of frequencies which the owner or operator of
the antenna has been licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to
operate, without a significant loss of communication capability within
developed areas of the Village.
   (d)   “Wireless telecommunications antenna” means an antenna designed to
transmit or receive communications as authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), excluding all amateur radio operator antennas.
   (e)   “Wireless telecommunications equipment building” means the structure
in which the electronic receiving and transmitting equipment for a wireless
telecommunications facility is housed.
   (f)   “Wireless telecommunications facility” means a facility consisting of
the equipment and structures involved in receiving telecommunications or radio

land-based telephone and/or communication lines.
   (g)   “Wireless telecommunications tower” means a structure intended to
support equipment used to transmit and/or receive telecommunications signals,
including monopoles and guyed and lattice construction steel structures.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 3-17-98.)
1288.02   INTENT.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted in a variety of zoning
districts and as conditional uses contingent upon specific requirements being
met. These criteria are in place in an attempt to minimize any adverse safety,
public welfare or visual impact through buffering, siting, design and
construction, and reducing the need for new towers.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 3-17-98.)
1288.03   USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   General Standards. This section applies to all wireless
telecommunications facilities independent of the zoning district in which they
are to be located. These general standards are to be supplemented with the
provisions for the particular applications specified in subsections (b) and (c)
hereof.
      (1)   Location. Wireless communications towers will be allowed in General
and Light Industrial Districts, with preference given to the areas of the
Village listed under subsection (b) hereof. A tower may not be located on a
building or structure that is listed on an historic register.
      (2)   Area. A minimum lot area of one acre shall be required for a tower.
In addition, lot area shall be sufficient to provide for all requirements of
setbacks, yards and building coverage as specified in the underlying zoning
district.
      (3)   Tower type. Monopole or lattice wireless communications towers,
which do not utilize guy wires, and their associated supporting buildings,
shall be allowed. A wireless telecommunications tower which is supported by guy
wires shall only be permitted if the applicant can prove that a monopole or
lattice tower not requiring guy wires is not reasonably feasible due to non-
economic reasons.
      (4)   Tower design. A tower must be designed to have sufficient
structural capacity to allow for at least three providers to be located on the
structure. Towers and antennas shall meet or exceed Ohio Building Code
regulations for wind resistance, icing, etc., including the ability to
withstand sustained winds of eighty m.p.h. and ANSI/EIA 222-F ice load
specifications.
      (5)   Equipment shelters /buildings. The wireless communications facility
must be designed to provide space on the site for equipment buildings large
enough to accommodate at least three providers. Any additional wireless
telecommunications equipment shelters shall be constructed of similar materials
and utilize a design similar to any existing equipment shelter located on the
property.
      (6)   Fencing. A security fence eight feet in height with barbed wire
around the top shall completely surround the tower, equipment building and any
guy wires.
      (7)   Buffer. Landscaping must be installed in accordance with Sections
1276.11 and
1278.11 and
Chapter 1280.
      (8)   Compatibility. The tower itself must be of such design and treated
with an architectural material so that it is camouflaged or blends in with
surrounding uses so as to be visually compatible with the neighborhood. The
tower shall be painted a noncontrasting gray or similar color minimizing its
visibility, unless otherwise required by the FCC or the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).
      (9)   Co-location. No new wireless communications facility may be erected
if there is a technically suitable space for a wireless communications facility
available on an existing wireless communications tower within the applicant's
search area in which the new wireless communications antenna is to be located.
      (10)   Arbitration of co-location disputes. The owner and operator of the
tower is required to sign a statement that all disputes with other providers
concerning co-location and the terms and conditions of co-location shall be
submitted to commercial arbitration under a system selected by the parties, but
if the parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices of the Commercial
Arbitration Provision of the American Arbitration Association.
      (11)   Discontinued use. If at any time the use of the facility is
discontinued for 180 days, a designated local official may declare the facility
abandoned. The facility's owner or operator will be contacted and instructed to
either reactivate the facility's use within 180 days, or dismantle and remove
the facility. If reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the permit will
expire on the 361st day. In the event that a facility is abandoned, the Village
reserves the right, after written notice to the owner, to claim all right,
title and interest in said facility for whatever use it deems appropriate.
      (12)   Bond. The owner or operator shall be required, as a condition of
issuance of a zoning certificate, to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to
the Law Director of at least three hundred dollars ($300.00) per vertical foot
from natural grade of the wireless telecommunications tower to the highest
point or antenna, which bond shall insure that an abandoned, obsolete or
destroyed wireless communications antenna or tower shall be removed as provided
in paragraph (a)(11) hereof. The amount of the bond may be increased at the
time of the application to account for inflation.
      (13)   Miscellaneous.
         A.   Advertising. No advertising is permitted anywhere on the
facility.
         B.   Lighting. The tower shall not be artificially lighted except to
insure safety or as required by the FAA.
         C.   Signage. Warning signs shall be posted around the facility with
an emergency telephone number of the person to contact in the event of an
emergency.
      (14)   Approvals. An application must be considered and approved by the
Building Department and Village Council with a subsequent building permit
issued by the Building Inspector.
   (b)   Permitted Use In Designated Districts. A wireless telecommunications
facility is permitted in TT overlay zoned districts, within the Limited
Industrial District and the General Industrial District, except where
immediately adjacent to Residential Districts. Placement of wireless
telecommunications facilities in the buffer zone shall be at the discretion of
Council. These regions have been determined to be areas where the erection of a
wireless telecommunications facility is technically suitable, aesthetically
acceptable and economically viable for applicants.
   (c)   Conditional Use. In other Industrial Districts, a wireless
telecommunications facility may be approved as a conditional use subject to the
following conditions:
      (1)   Sole use on a lot. A wireless telecommunications facility is
permitted as a sole use on a lot subject to the following:

which does not require identification markers or painting by the FAA.
         C.   Underground equipment shelters are encouraged, and may be
required by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         D.   No tower may be located within 2,000 feet of an existing
telecommunications tower outside of an overlay district.
         E.   A landscaped buffer area of at least fifteen feet in depth shall
be placed between the wireless telecommunications facilities and the public
rights of way and any adjacent properties from which a direct view can be had
of the facilities, other than the tower itself. The area shall consist of an
evergreen screen of either a solid six-foot hedge, or a row of evergreen trees
planted and spaced no more than ten feet apart.
         F.   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible.
   (2)   Combined with another use. A wireless telecommunications facility is
permitted on a property with an existing use, or on a vacant parcel subject to
the following additional standards:
         A.   The minimum distance from a parcel on which a tower is proposed
to any Residential or Institutional District lot line shall be 300 feet. An
exemption may be requested for a tower disguised as a tree or other natural
structure.
         B.   The maximum height of a tower, including antenna, shall be that
which does not require identification markers or painting by the FAA.
         C.   The existing use on the property may be any permitted use in the

   (a)   The Village has some areas of undeveloped land and areas of possible
future re-development of land adjacent to Interstate Route 480 or the
interchange of Granger Road and I-480. Development of these lands may require
special consideration due to the impact of the interstate highway, type of the
development proposed, or the size of the area to be developed. The Planned
Development Interchange Commercial Overlay District is hereby established to
achieve among others, the following objectives:
      (1)   To insure compatibility with surrounding development;
      (2)   To provide for an acceptable transition between commercial and
residential land areas; and
      (3)   To provide for a compatible mixed-use development.
   (b)   The Planned Development Interchange Commercial Overlay District may
assist in accomplishing these objectives by change of zoning. The Planning
Commission and Village Council shall designate, regulate and restrict the
location, design and use of buildings, structures and interior streets; promote
high standards of external appearance of buildings and grounds; establish a
development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography, scenic
vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents disruption of natural drainage
patterns and minimize disruptions to flow of traffic on adjacent thoroughfares.

1450.01   ESTABLISHMENT; MEMBERSHIP; REMOVAL.
   There is hereby established an Architectural Board of Review (hereinafter
referred to as the Board) whose regular membership shall consist of the
Architect, the Engineer, the Building Official, and two residents who shall be
appointed by the Mayor with the consent of Council for a term of six years. Any
member of the Board shall be subject to removal by the Mayor for cause.
However, such removal shall not become final without the concurrence of at
least four members of Council.
(Ord. 54-01. Passed 4-17-01.)
1450.02   PURPOSE.
   The Board shall protect the value, appearance and use of property on which
exterior buildings, signs and other structures are constructed or altered to
maintain a high character of community development, to protect the public
health, safety, convenience and welfare, and to protect real estate in the
Village from impairment or destruction of value. Such purpose shall be
accomplished by the Board regulating, according to accepted and recognized
architectural principles, the design, use of materials, finished grade lines,
dimensions, orientation and location of all exterior alterations to main and
accessory buildings, signs, structures and landscaping moved, altered,
remodeled or repaired, subject to the provisions of the Planning and Zoning
Code, this Building and Housing Code and other applicable ordinances of the
Village. In reviewing, regulating and approving building plans, the Board shall
consider and be cognizant of the development of adjacent, contiguous and
neighboring buildings and properties. The Board shall also review and recommend
to the Village Council any changes or amendments to this Building and Housing
Code which it deems advisable, including, but not limited to, the types of
homes, exterior finishes, basements, etc.
(Ord. 61-00. Passed 6-6-00.)
1450.03   AUTHORITY.
   The Board shall receive and promptly review and pass upon all drawings,
data, reports and complaints in the order filed under published rules and
regulations consistent with the purpose of the Board and adopted by it. The
Board shall immediately notify the Building Department in writing of action
taken in each instance, and no building permit or sign permit, for a sign
located in an industrial, limited industrial or commercial district, shall be
issued unless plans and specifications therefor have been approved by the
Board. In making its determination, the Board shall review all drawings, data,
reports and objects and make such further investigations as it may deem
appropriate. The Board shall apply accepted engineering and architectural
principles. It shall also apply generally accepted principles of real property
appraisal and shall take into consideration the nature and extent of the
development of adjacent and neighboring properties.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00; Ord. 80-01. Passed 7-3-01.)
1450.04   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   No member of the Board shall participate in the review of any work of which
he or she or his or her partner or professional associate is the author or in
which he, she or they have any direct or indirect financial interest (this also
applies to relatives). If such an occasion should arise, the member shall not
enter into the review of the work in question.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00.)
1450.05   COMPENSATION.
   The Architect, the Engineer, and the Building Official shall be compensated
in the amount of sixty dollars ($60.00) an hour (minimum of one hour). The two
residents shall be compensated at the rate of thirty dollars ($30.00) per
meeting. The secretary shall be paid fifty dollars ($50.00) an hour (minimum of
one hour).
(Ord. 61-00. Passed 6-6-00.)
1450.06   REVIEW OF PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   No person shall construct, alter or relocate any building or structure
without first submitting detailed plans and specifications, including
representations of exterior appearance, to the Board at the time of filing an
application for a building permit. No person shall construct, alter or relocate
any sign located in an industrial, limited industrial or commercial district
without first submitting the sketches of the proposed sign and other
information required for an application for a sign permit to the Board at the
time of filing an application for a sign permit. No plans shall be considered
unless, at the time of filing, the applicant submits a fifty dollar ($50.00)
non-refundable fee for residential buildings or structures, a fifty dollar
($50.00) non-refundable fee for signs,, and a two hundred dollar ($200.00) fee
for commercial buildings and structures. At the next regular meeting, not more
than 30 days after such filing, the Board shall review and pass upon all
drawings, data, reports and complaints filed with the Building Official, for
the purposes set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 61-00. Passed 6-6-00; Ord. 80-01. Passed 7-3-01.)

1450.08   SECRETARY.
   The Board shall appoint a secretary who shall prepare and cause to be kept
in the office of the Clerk/Treasurer a complete record open to public
inspection of all meetings of the Board, and who shall perform other duties as
assigned by the Board.
(Ord. 49-00. Passed 4-18-00.)
1450.09   DUTIES OF BUILDING OFFICIAL.
   The Building Official shall present to the other members of the Board any
changes deemed outdated or unenforceable. The Board shall review the proposed
changes and make recommendations for these changes to Council.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00.)
1450.10   STANDARDS.
   Standards, regulations and criteria are hereby set forth to be administered
by the Board for the purpose of alleviating, to the extent possible, the
occurrence of adverse effects. The Board may require a redesign or may
disapprove any application for a permit referred to it, provided that it finds
that the building, structure or sign for which the permit was applied would, if
erected, be so detrimental to desirable property values or the development of
the surrounding areas as to provoke one or more of the harmful effects.
   (a)   Excessive Similarity. There shall be no excessive similarity to any
other building, structure or sign existing or for which a permit has been
issued, or to any other building, structure or sign included in the same permit
application, facing upon the same street and with the same setback of the
proposed site, with respect to one or more of the following features of
exterior design or appearance:
      (1)   Apparently identical facade, bulk and mass of building;
      (2)   Substantially identical size and arrangement of either the
entrance, windows or other openings or breaks in the facade facing the street,
including a direct reverse arrangement; or
      (3)   Other significant identical features, such as, but not limited to,
materials, roof line and height or other design elements.
   (b)   Excessive Dissimilarity. There shall be no excessive dissimilarity in
appropriateness in relation to any other building, structure or sign existing
or for which a permit has been issued, or to any other building, structure or
sign included in the same permit application, facing upon the same street and
with the same setback of the proposed site, with respect to significant design
features such as material or quality or architectural design, provided that it
is found that the excessive dissimilarity is of such a nature as to be expected
to provoke beyond reasonable doubt one or more of the adverse effects.
   (c)   Architectural Character. An underlying architectural character should
prevail. There should be some repetition of basic elements through harmony of
colors and a common scale. However, each individual dwelling should have an
identity and the result should be an aesthetic unity. The findings shall not be
based on personal preference as to taste or choice of architectural style and a
finding of inappropriate design shall mean that it is of such a nature as to
produce one or more of the adverse effects.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00; Ord. 80-01. Passed 7-3-01.)
1450.11   PROCEDURE, QUORUM AND VOTE.
   The Architect and the Engineer, after consultation with the Building
Inspector, shall determine the schedule of regular meetings of the Board in
order that applications are processed expeditiously in accordance with
provisions of applicable regulations. If an application for a permit for a
building or structure is filed at least ten working days before a scheduled
meeting of the Board, it shall be acted upon at the next meeting unless good
cause is shown why action must be delayed.
   Approval shall be had by a majority of the Board.
   The Board shall immediately notify the Building Official of action taken in
each instance, and no permit shall be issued by the Building Official unless
plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the Board.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00.)
1450.12   REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The Board shall provide for a detailed report of all its proceedings and
shall submit a copy of its decisions.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00.)
1450.13   APPEALS FROM DECISIONS OF THE BOARD.
   Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Board may, within
thirty days from the date of the decision of the Board, appeal such decision to
Council.
(Ord. 16-00. Passed 2-1-00.)
1450.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions or requirements of this chapter, or
any amendment or supplement hereto, or fails to comply herewith, or with any
ruling or order issued by the Building Inspector acting as the Zoning
Inspector, or builds in violation of a detailed statement or plans submitted
and approved hereunder, or any architect, builder or contractor who may be
employed to assist in the commission of any violation, for each and every
violation or noncompliance, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree, and
shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not
more than sixty days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

1462.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Brooklyn Heights, State of Ohio, does ordain these flood damage
prevention regulations.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (e)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (f)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (g)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (h)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (i)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (j)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (k)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1462.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Village.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1462.13(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Hall at 345 Tuxedo Avenue, Brooklyn Heights,
Ohio.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.” A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.” See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.” A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community, depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.

flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.

floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation.” The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.” A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a “manufactured home park” means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a “manufactured home park,” even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Brooklyn
Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 15, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Village of Brooklyn Heights flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1462.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1462.13(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1462.12(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1462.12(j)(1).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Village of
Brooklyn Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the Village
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the Village has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1462.14, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other Federal,
State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with increased cost of
compliance insurance claims.

standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of Section
1462.13(d)(5)C.
   (g)   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles must meet at least one of
the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days; or
      (2)   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use;
      (3)   They must meet all standards of Section
1462.13(d).
   (h)   Above-Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above-ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood-Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood-
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1462.12(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Brooklyn Heights
and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the
proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1462.13(i)(1)B.1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1462.12(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1462.14   APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to serve as the
Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Village Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the Village
Hall at 345 Tuxedo Avenue, Brooklyn Heights, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1462.14(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board, provided that such
person shall file, within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1462.14(d)(2)A. through K. have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 60-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village shall prosecute any violation of these
regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

1466.01   PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION.
   No land located in a Commercial Service District, Limited Industrial
District or General Industrial District, as set forth in the Zoning Code,
which, in whole or in part, is below the natural or established grade of the
street upon which it abuts, shall be filled in with any type of material,
except as hereinafter set forth, unless the owner thereof shall first secure a
permit to do so. Application for such a permit shall be made in writing to the
Building Inspector on forms supplied by him or her, showing a sketch of the
land to be filled in, together with a sketch of the entire parcel owned by the
applicant, and also the parcels and the roads abutting on its boundary lines,
with dimensions of and elevations for all lot lines and streets, before
filling, the area desired to be filled in, with dimensions, showing the depth
of fill from the street and the width thereof in relation to the side lines of
the parcel of the applicant, and showing elevations of the proposed filled-in
area, both before and after filling, and the slope of the fill on all sides
which shall exceed two feet vertically for each three feet horizontally. Said
application shall describe the route of the trucks to the applicant's property,
the auditor’s permanent parcel number for such land and such adjacent lands,
the amount of material, in cubic yards, requested to be used as fill, the
length of time requested for filling, and such other information as may be
requested by the Building Inspector so that Council may understand the
situation. In setting forth the elevations, the applicant, where a sketch is
used, may approximate the number of feet below the natural or established grade
of the street. Where any part of such land upon which said fill is to be
deposited, or where any part of such adjacent land, is more than ten feet below
such natural or established grade of the street, the applicant shall furnish
the Building Inspector with a topographical survey of such land and such
adjacent lands, prepared by a registered engineer, showing the same information
as required by the sketch. Upon being satisfied that the application meets the
requirements set forth herein, the Building Inspector shall forward the same to
Council.
(Ord. 46-82. Passed 8-3-82.)
1466.02   PERMIT APPROVAL AND ISSUANCE; POSTING OF PERMIT REQUIRED; LIMITATION
ON DEPTH OF FILL.
   The Council shall examine an application, together with the information and
data furnished to it by the Building Inspector, and the information, data, and
opinion furnished to it by the Village Engineer, and, in the case of a renewal
application, council shall examine the application for renewal, together with
the above-stated information and the opinion furnished by the Village Engineer,
as well as all information and opinions from the Cuyahoga County Board of
Health, and, upon being satisfied that such fill will not devaluate the
properties in the neighborhood, that such fill will not cast water upon either
adjacent lands or any other lands, or affect the natural drainage of water in
the surrounding area thereof, the Council may, by ordinance, authorize the
Building Inspector to issue a permit to fill in, in accordance with the
provisions herein set forth and any special requirements deemed necessary
arising from the topography of such land and such adjacent lands, such special
requirements to be set out in said ordinance. Before passing such ordinance and
to aid the Council in the performance of its duty, the Council shall require
the applicant, at his or her expense, to secure a report from a soil
conservation service agency as to the effect such fill will have on the
surrounding land in the area. The agency may be either governmental or private.
Council may approve a permit to be effective for thirty days from the date of
the permit's issuance by the Building Inspector, but in no event to become
effective more than ninety days from the date of Council approval. Such permit
so issued by the Building Inspector shall contain a statement that the
applicant will conduct such fill in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, and if any special requirements are set forth in the ordinance passed
by Council, the same shall be copied on the permit, or a certified copy of the
ordinance shall be attached to such permit and so noted on the permit itself.
Said permit shall be posted on the owner's property in a conspicuous location
during the effective period of the permit.
   Where the land to be filled in is part of a subdivision plat filed for
record, or the same abuts upon a duly dedicated street without a subdivision of
the lands abutting thereon, the dedicated plat of which has been filed for
record, and the developer of such subdivision or dedicator of such street has
done mass grading of the lands in such subdivision or of the lands abutting
such street in accordance with a grading plan submitted to Council with such
subdivision plat or street dedication, the depth of such fill at any point
shall not exceed one foot.
(Ord. 46-82. Passed 8-3-82.)
1466.03   FILL MATERIAL.
   No fill material shall be deposited or permitted to remain on any land or
any portion thereof, other than the following:
   (a)   Natural material, but limited to natural earth and stone.
   (b)   Artificial material, if composed of concrete, asphalt, brick, tile and
similar material, but no organic material of any kind.
   On special application to Council, the Council may issue a temporary permit
for a specifically stated period, allowing the deposit of material from
construction debris or from razed or demolished buildings, consisting mainly of
rubble, stone, masonry and the incidental wood and fibrous material normally
connected therewith and those materials exempt from Ohio and Federal solid
waste laws.
(Ord. 62-86. Passed 8-12-86.)
1466.04   HOURS OF OPERATION OF TRUCKS; REMOVAL OF SPILLAGE; TRUCK
SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Trucks carrying material to a fill shall operate Monday through
Saturday only, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Any spillage from
such trucks shall be swept up and removed from the streets within twelve hours
after notice is given by any member of the Police Department, the Service
Director or the Building Inspector to the owner, the same to be done by the
person doing the trucking or the permittee.
   (b)   All such trucks shall be limited to two axles per truck, and no truck
with a load shall exceed ten and one-half tons. However, the Council, in
consideration of the route traveled, the conditions of the streets of such
route, or the time of the year during which such filling is to be performed,
may set a lower tonnage if, in the opinion of the Village Engineer and Council,
a lower tonnage is deemed advisable.
(Ord. 59-86. Passed 8-5-86.)
1466.05   FILL AT OR ABOVE GRADE PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No fill material shall be deposited, maintained or suffered or
permitted to remain on any land or any portion thereof if such material is
level with or higher than the natural or established grade of the abutting
street.
   (b)   The permittee, in filling such land, as he or she progresses, shall
maintain a grade for such fill the same as the natural or established grade of
the abutting street, or within five degrees of such grade, but at no time shall
the grade of such fill be above such natural or established grade. When such
land has been filled in to the extent that the area of such land so filled
comprises a building lot for the district in which it is located, then the
permit for such fill shall become void and any subsequent filling shall be
unlawful.
(Ord. 59-86. Passed 8-5-86.)
1466.06   BULLDOZING REQUIRED.
   A permittee shall bulldoze such fill to the grade set forth in Section
1466.05 at least once in every thirty days.
(Ord. 59-86. Passed 8-5-86.)
1466.07   EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF PERMITS; RENEWALS.
   All permits authorized to be issued under this chapter shall be effective
for a period of 120 days, and upon termination of such period, such permits
shall become void, and any filling after the expiration of said 120 days shall
be unlawful. Where a permit has been issued and the permittee determines that
the requested fill cannot be made within said 120 day period, said permittee
may make a subsequent application for a renewal permit for an additional 120
days. More than one renewal application may be made by the permittee if filed
with the Building Inspector within the 120 days of a prior permit. Such renewal
application shall be made to the Building Inspector on the same form as the
original application, but the same shall recite the date of the issuance of the
original permit, and the original application, the survey, if made, the date
and information in connection with the original permit shall be incorporated by

copied on the prior permit, may authorize a renewal permit by motion. Such

incorporate such new terms and requirements.

permittee, either by the Police Department or by certified mail, any filling in
after such service shall be unlawful. In any event, each and every permit
issued under the provisions of this chapter by the Council shall automatically
expire six months from the date of issuance.

post a one thousand dollars ($1,000) cash bond with the Village for fill of up
to 5,000 cubic yards, and a five thousand dollars ($5,000) cash bond for fill
in excess of 5,000 cubic yards.

event longer than six months, the permittee shall either return the land to a
natural wooded state or shall landscape the filled land with sod, seed or other
horticultural material.
(Ord. 102-00. Passed 11-8-00.)

   (b)   Notwithstanding the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof, the
Village may, without invoking such criminal procedure, invoke and maintain any
remedy provided by law or equity, including, but not limited to, remedies to
enjoin or abate any violation. The institution of any criminal or civil
proceedings by the Village shall in no way prohibit an owner specially damaged
by the violation from seeking such remedies as the law or equity may provide.

street.
   (b)   The permittee, in filling such land, as he or she progresses, shall
maintain a grade for such fill the same as the natural or established grade of
the abutting street, or within 5% of such grade, but at no time shall the grade
of such fill be above such natural or established grade. When such land has

make a subsequent application for a new permit for an additional 60 days. More
than one subsequent application may be made by the permittee if filed with the
Building Inspector within the 60 days of a prior permit. Such subsequent

original permit, and the original application, the survey, if made, the date
and information in connection with the original permit shall be incorporated by
reference on such subsequent application. Such subsequent application shall be
forthwith presented to the Council, and the Council, being satisfied that the
permittee has conducted the fill in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and the special requirements copied on the prior permit, may authorize
a renewal permit by motion. Such permit so authorized shall likewise be limited

original or last subsequent permit, as the case may be. Where the Council
desires to add terms and requirements therein not set forth, which become
necessarily apparent because of the operation of the fill, then instead of a
motion authorizing such subsequent or renewal permit, the same shall be done by
ordinance, so as to incorporate such new terms and requirements.
(Ord. 22-94. Passed 3-1-94.)
1468.10   PERMIT REVOCATION.
   All permits, whether original or subsequent, shall be revocable at the
pleasure of the Council. Action revoking a permit shall be done by ordinance,
and after a certified copy of such ordinance has been served upon the

house, building or structure, or any part thereof, any tree, pole or
smokestack, or any excavation, basement, cellar, sidewalk, subspace, dock,
wharf or landing dock, which, in whole or in part, by reason of the condition
in which the same is permitted to be or remain, shall or may endanger the
health, life, limb or property of, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience,
discomfort, damage or injury to, any person in the Village, in any one or more
of the following particulars:
   (a)   By reason of being a nuisance to the general health of the community;
   (b)   By reason of being a fire hazard;
   (c)   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy or use on, in, upon, about or
around; or
   (d)   By reason of being a nuisance because of long continued vacancy or
lack of reasonable or adequate maintenance of a structure and /or premises
adjacent thereto, thereby depreciating the enjoyment and use of property in the
immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful to the community in
which such structure is situated.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.02   COMPLAINT; INSPECTIONS; AUTHORITY OF BUILDING INSPECTOR, POLICE CHIEF
AND FIRE CHIEF; SUMMARY ABATEMENT; NOTICE; DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Whenever a complaint is made to the Building Inspector of the
existence of a public nuisance in the Village, he or she shall promptly cause
to be inspected the premises on which it is alleged that such public nuisance
exists. Should the Inspector find that a public nuisance may exist and that the
public health, safety or welfare may be in immediate danger, he or she shall
promptly notify the Chief of Police and the Fire Chief. The Chief of Police, if
he or she has not already done so, and the Fire Chief, if he or she has not
already done so, shall cause to be inspected the premises on which it is
alleged that such public nuisance exists. Written reports of the inspections
and of the findings of the Chiefs with respect to the existence of a public
nuisance and any immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare,
shall be filed with the Inspector. Should any one or more of the aforesaid
officers find that a public nuisance exists and that the nature thereof is such
as to require its summary abatement, it shall be the duty of the Inspector to
cause photographs of such nuisance to be made and to file and keep in his or
her office the written reports of the findings of the aforesaid officials. The
Inspector shall then determine the person who, from the records in the County
Auditor’s office, owns the property, and immediately cause a written notice to
be served on such person, either personally or by leaving a copy at the usual
place of residence or business of such owner, or at the address of such owner
shown in the County Auditor’s records, or by mailing a copy to such owner at
such place or address, by United States certified mail, return receipt
requested. If service of written notice is unable to be perfected by any of
such methods, then the Inspector shall cause a copy of the notice to be left
with the person, if any, in possession of the premises on which it is alleged
that such public nuisance exists. If there is no person in possession thereof,
he or she shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the premises.
   (b)   The notice shall state, in brief, the findings of any one or more of
the aforesaid officers, with respect to the existence of a public nuisance, and
shall further state that unless the owner or owners thereof cause the abatement
of the public nuisance within twenty-four hours after service of the notice,
the same will be abated by the Village at the expense of such owner or owners.
   (c)   Any act, inspection or finding required to be made or carried out by
any public official under this chapter, may be carried out by any of his or her
subordinates assigned or directed by him or her to carry out such function.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.03   NON-SUMMARY ABATEMENT; NOTICE; HEARING.
   (a)   Should any one or more of the officers referred to in Section
1476.02, after the inspection of the premises in or on which it is reported
that a public nuisance may exist, be of the opinion that a public nuisance does
exist, but that the nature thereof is not such as to require summary abatement,
photographs and reports of his or her findings, the same as set forth in
Section
1476.02, shall be made and filed with the Building Inspector. It shall be the
duty of the Inspector, in such cases, to serve written notice on the person
who, from the records in the County Auditor’s office, appears to be the owner
of the aforesaid property, by serving him or her personally or by leaving a
copy at the usual place of residence or business of such owner or at the
address of such owner shown in such Auditor’s records, or by mailing a copy to
such owner at such place or address, by United States certified mail, return
receipt requested. If service of the notice is unable to be perfected by any of
such methods, then the Inspector shall cause such notice to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Village, once each week for two
consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the notice to be left with
the person, if any, in possession of the premises in or on which it is alleged
that such public nuisance exists, or, if there is no person in possession
thereof, he or she shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the
premises.
   (b)   The notice shall state, in brief, the findings of any one or more of
the officers referred to in Section
1476.02, with respect to the existence of a public nuisance, and shall further
state that unless the owner thereof causes the abatement of the public nuisance
within thirty days after service of the notice, the same shall be abated by the
Village at the expense of such owner. The owner may at any time after receipt
of the notice make a request, in writing or in person, to the Inspector, to be
furnished with a written list of the items which are alleged to constitute the
public nuisance and which are alleged to be in need of repair and/or
replacement.
   (c)   The owner may make immediate application in writing or in person to
the Inspector for a building permit to undertake the repair or replacement of
the items alleged to constitute the public nuisance. The Inspector, upon being
furnished by such owner with the complete plans and specifications covering the
repairs or replacements in conformity with the standards of Village ordinances,
shall, upon approval of the plans and specifications, cause a building permit
to be issued to such owner. The Inspector may grant more than thirty days to
the owner in which to effect the repairs and/or replacements.
   (d)   The owner may, within fourteen days after receipt of the notice, make
a demand, in writing, to the Inspector for a hearing on the question of
whether, in fact, a public nuisance exists and/or whether more than thirty days
should be granted to the owner to abate the nuisance. The hearing shall be held
within ten days following receipt of the written demand and at least two days
notice of the hearing shall be given to the owner. The hearing shall be
conducted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board may amend or modify the
notice and/or order or extend the time for compliance by the owner with parts
of the abatement notice by such date or dates as a majority of such Board may
determine. A copy of the decision of the Board shall be promptly served upon
the owner in the manner provided for in Section
1476.02. The decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive unless the
owner files, within ten days after the aforesaid decision is rendered, an
action in or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction; otherwise, the same
shall become final and conclusive at the termination of such action or appeal
proceeding as determined by such court.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.04   FAILURE OF OWNER TO ABATE; REMEDY OF VILLAGE.
   Should a nuisance not be abated at the expiration of the time stated in the
notice or within such additional time as the Building Inspector or the Board of
Zoning Appeals may grant the owner, the Building Inspector shall have the right
to enter upon the premises and to abate the nuisance found thereon. In abating
such nuisance, he or she may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete
abatement of the same and, should it be practicable to sell or salvage any
material obtained in the course of such abatement, he or she may sell the same
at private or public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an
account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in
the General Fund of the Village and any difference between the amount so
received and the cost of the abatement shall be levied as an assessment against
the property in question, by Council, certified to the County Auditor and
collected as any other assessment by the Village. Should the proceeds of the
sale of such salvaged material exceed the cost of such abatement, the excess
shall be paid to the owner of the premises in or on which such nuisance was
abated, when his or her proper claim thereof is established. In abating such
nuisance, the Inspector may call upon Village officials or employees for
whatever assistance may be necessary or may, by private contract, obtain the
abatement thereof, if such private contract may be let without any expense
whatever to the Village.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.05   REFUSAL TO OBEY ORDER OF BUILDING INSPECTOR.
   No person who is able to obey a proper order issued by the Building
Inspector under and pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall refuse or
neglect to do so.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.06   VERIFICATION OF NECESSITY OF ABATEMENT REQUIRED.
   (a)   No proceeding under this chapter may be maintained unless at least two
of the following named officers find that a public nuisance in fact exists: the
Chief of Police; the Fire Chief; the Building Inspector.
   (b)   In the event of a proposed summary abatement, no public nuisance shall
be summarily abated until and unless all of the aforesaid officers find that
the summary abatement of such nuisance is necessary.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)
1476.07   INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall not be deemed to be a limitation or restriction on the
authority of any department, division, official or employee of the Village, but
shall be deemed to be an enlargement of any authority existing by virtue of
State statutes or any ordinance heretofore enacted by Council.
(Ord. 89-73. Passed 12-18-73.)

this chapter.

   This chapter shall be known as the “Exterior Property Maintenance Code” and
may be referred to in this chapter at “this Code”.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.02   FINDINGS OF FACT; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Village structures
used for residential and nonresidential uses which are, or may become in the
future, substandard with respect to the structure and maintenance thereof, or,
further, that conditions, including, but not limited to, structural
deterioration, lack of maintenance, the appearance of the exterior of the
premises, the existence of fire hazards and unsanitary conditions, constitute a
menace to the health, safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents
and inhabitants of the Village. It is further found and declared that, by
reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain properties
have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums,
and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions
will grow and spread and will necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large
amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same. By reason of timely
regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums and
blight may be prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values
thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and
nonresidential uses and immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health,
safety and welfare protected and fostered.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.03   PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this Code are to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance
and condition of all residential and nonresidential premises; to impose certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators; to authorize and
establish procedures for the inspection of residential and nonresidential
premises; to fix penalties for violations of this Code; and to provide for the
right of access across adjoining premises to permit repairs. This Code is
hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public interest and it is
intended that this Code be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes as
stated herein.

used for dwelling, retail, commercial, business, light manufacturing or
industrial occupancy, shall comply with the provision of this Code, whether or
not such building shall have been constructed, altered or repaired before or
after the enactment of this Code, and irrespective of any permits or licenses
which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the building or for
the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective
date of this Code. This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and
continued occupancy and use of all such buildings and does not replace or

that of any other ordinance of the Village or under the laws of the State, then
the higher standard contained in any such other ordinance or law shall prevail.
   (c)   Permits and Licenses. After the date of enactment hereof, all licenses
and permits shall be issued upon compliance with this Code, as well as
compliance with the ordinances under which such licenses and permits are
granted.
   (d)   Compliance With Other Ordinances. No license or permit or other

occupant from complying with any such other provision, nor any official of the
Village from enforcing any such other provision.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.06   DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNERS AND OPERATORS.

prescribed in this Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and

thereof.
   (b)   Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Code, the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the owner and operator on one hand, and the
occupant on the other, shall not be altered or affected by an agreement or

and the condition of accessory structures shall be maintained so that the
appearance of the premises and all buildings thereon shall reflect a level of
maintenance in keeping with the residential standards of the immediate
neighborhood in order that the appearance of the premises and structures shall

prevailing appraisal practices and standards, will depreciate the value of
neighboring and adjoining premises as aforesaid.

   (c)   Reports to Council. The enforcing officer shall report to Council
after each monthly inspection regarding the general maintenance of property

   (b)   Search Warrants or Access Warrants. In addition to the provisions of
subsection (a) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit,
apply to Parma Municipal Court for a search warrant, setting forth factually
the actual conditions and circumstances that provide a reasonable basis for
believing that a nuisance or violation of this Code exists on the premises. If
the Court is satisfied as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, the Court
may authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access to and
inspection of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or violation
exists. A warrant for access may be issued by the Court upon an affidavit of
the Property Maintenance Officer establishing grounds therefor.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.17   PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT; NOTICE; APPEAL.
   (a)   Contents of Notice. An abatement notice shall specify the violation
committed, what must be done to correct the same, a reasonable period of time,
not to exceed forty-five days, to correct or abate the violation and the right
of the person served to request a hearing. The notice shall become an order of
the Property Maintenance Officer in ten days after service, unless a hearing is
requested pursuant to subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Service of Notice. Notice may be served personally, by prepaid
telegram or by mail, with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not
reside on the premises, the last known address shall be the address of the
owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance
of the building. The Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice
to any owner or operator of any violation at any address other than the last
known address as provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the
Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the Officer. The date of
service of the notice shall be determined where service is by mail as of the
day following the day of mailing for notices to addresses within the Village,
and as of the fourth day after the day of mailing for notices to addresses
outside the Village. Where the day of service would fall upon a Sunday or other
day when mail is not ordinarily delivered, then the day of service shall be the
next regular delivery day. Notwithstanding any other provisions contained
herein, where premises are subject to registration pursuant to Section
1490.22 and have been so registered, notice served upon the agent designated
therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator and lessor of the
premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner, operator or lessor has failed
to register the premises as required under Section
1490.22, or if the present premises have been registered and the agent
designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the registration,
the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting notice
upon the premises in a conspicuous place as near as possible to the front
entrance thereof.
   (c)   When Notice Becomes a Final Order; Request for Hearing. Within ten
days of the date of service of a notice, the notice shall constitute a final
order, unless any person affected by the notice requests a hearing before the
Board of Zoning Appeals and serves a written request within the ten-day period,
in person or by mail, on the Chairperson of the Board. Such request for a
hearing before the Board shall set forth briefly the grounds or reasons on
which the request for a hearing is based and the factual matters contained in
the notice of violation which are to be disputed at the hearing. The
Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty
days therefrom and upon five days notice to the party aggrieved, set the matter
down for hearing.
   (d)   Determination at Hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Chairperson of the Board shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by issuance and
service of subpoenas, to required by subpoena the production of books, records
or other documents at any such hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be
determined by him or her and to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order
for the enforcement of any such subpoena as provided by law. Determination
shall be made within ten days from the completion of the hearing. The Board
shall issue an order either incorporating the determinations and directions
contained in the notice, modifying the same or withdrawing the notice.
   (e)   Extension of Time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the
time for correction or abatement of the violations for an additional period of
time not to exceed thirty days, except where major capital improvements or
renovations are involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period not to exceed ninety days beyond the expiration date of
the original notice.
   (f)   Noncompliance With Notice. Whenever the owner, agent, occupant or
operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with
any notice of the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final order as
provided in subsection (c) hereof, the Officer may advise the Law Director of
the circumstances and request the Law Director to institute an appropriate
action at law to compel compliance.
   (g)   Referral of Violations. A violation of any ordinance other than this
Code discovered by the Property Maintenance Officer or his or her
representative shall be reported to the official or agency responsible for the
enforcement of such ordinance.
   (h)   Where Notice and Hearing Not Required Prior to Court Proceedings.
Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (a) through (d) hereof,
violations of the following sections may be prosecuted without notice by the
filing of a complaint by the Property Maintenance Officer in the Parma
Municipal Court: Sections
1490.16,
1490.17(d) and
1490.22.
   (i)   Effect of Notice on Owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
Code, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is also the
operator, shall constitute notice of violations set forth therein until such
violations are abated in conformity with this Code and other applicable
ordinances of the Village.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.18   EXISTING OFFENSES AND VIOLATIONS NOT DISCHARGED.
   The repeal of any provision of any other ordinance by this Code shall not
affect any action for prosecution or abatement under any such ordinance or any
notice, complaint or order issued by any officer or agency of the Village prior
to the effective date hereof, or concerning any prosecution or other steps of
enforcement which have been taken or are being taken within any administrative
agency or in the Parma Municipal Court for enforcement thereof.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)
1490.19   POWERS AND DUTIES OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE OFFICER.
   (a)   Promulgation of Rules and Regulations. The Property Maintenance
Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Code, provided that such rules and
regulations do not conflict with this Code and that they conform to the general
standards prescribed by this Code. The Officer shall file copies of such rules
and regulations with the Clerk/Treasurer, the Municipal Engineer, the Fire
Chief, the Public Building Committee of Council and the Board of Zoning
Appeals, and shall make available in the Officer's office a copy for inspection
by members of the public during regular business hours. Such rules and
regulations shall have the approval of the Engineer and the Fire Chief,
respectively, where the provisions thereof relate to matters which are also
under the jurisdiction of the supervision of each officer. In the case of a
conflict, the rule or regulation may be promulgated by direction of the Public
Building Committee of Council. Such rules and regulations shall have the same
force and effect as the provisions of this Code, and the violations thereof
shall be enforced as violations of the express provisions of this Code as
herein provided.
   (b)   Power to Vary or Modify Provisions. The Property Maintenance Officer
shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of the requirements of this
Code upon written application therefor by an owner, operator or occupant, after
making a determination that:
      (1)   Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved by the
Officer will not in any material way alter the standards of this Code and shall
not affect detrimentally the health or safety of the occupants or the health,
safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the
immediate neighborhood;
      (2)   Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
health, safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom;
      (3)   The owner or operator is without any practical or feasible means to
comply with the strict provisions of this Code;
      (4)   The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would require
the installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed five hundred
dollars ($500.00) in cost; and
      (5)   The premises subject to this Code are contemplated for acquisition
or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a public agency
having the power of eminent domain, and there is a reasonable likelihood that
the premises will be acquired and razed or moved within a period of two years.
Any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall be cancelled and the Officer
shall strictly enforce this Code if it is ascertained subsequent to the
granting of the waiver that the premises are in fact not to be acquired for any
public use or purpose.
         A.   Right to hearing. Upon denial of any such application, the owner,
operator or applicant may request a hearing, which shall be requested in
accordance with the provisions of Section
1490.17(c).
         B.   Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such application
shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this Code concerning any
proceedings which are pending in the Parma Municipal Court when the application
is filed, nor shall any variance or modification allowed hereunder constitute a
vested right against any ordinance enacted hereafter by Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this Code.
         C.   Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations
or modifications are approved by any section of this Code, by the Property
Maintenance Officer, by an action of the Board of Zoning Appeals or by any
court, a written record thereof stating the name of the applicant, the address
of the premises, the variation or modification approved, the date of approval
and the reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall be
prepared by the Officer and filed both under the section or sections of this
Code to which the variation or modification applies and under the address of
the premises. Such files shall be available for public inspection in the office
of the Officer during regular business hours.
   (c)   Annual Review. The Property Maintenance Officer shall, in the month of
May of each year, review with the Fire Chief, the Municipal Engineer and the
Law Director, the procedure and operation of this Code, and report to Council,
on or before September 15:
      (1)   Any recommended amendment, addition or modification to the
provisions of this Code consonant with the field experience of the personnel
charged with enforcement;
      (2)   A summary of the enforcement experience indicating the number of
violations abated, the number of cased processed in the Parma Municipal Court,
the number of inspections made and such other and further pertinent information
as will provide Council with an annual account of progress in securing the
standards required by this Code; and
      (3)   Any further recommendations as to how this Code and the procedures
and operations hereunder can be improved.
(Ord. 6-96. Passed 1-6-96.)

   (a)   Application for Inspection. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant,
bona fide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or bona fide prospective occupant,

to in this chapter as “this Code.”
(Ord. 122-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
1491.02   FINDINGS OF FACT; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Village rental
housing properties which are, or may become in the future, substandard with
respect to the structure and maintenance thereof, or, further, that conditions,
including but not limited to structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, the
appearance of the exterior of the premises, the existence of fire hazards and
unsanitary conditions, constitute a menace to the health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the Village. It is
further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are
not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and
will necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same. By reason of timely regulations and
restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of rental housing properties and
immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare
protected and fostered.
(Ord. 122-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
1491.03   PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this Code are to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance
and condition of all rental housing properties; to impose certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators; to authorize and
establish procedures for the inspection of rental housing properties; to
provide for the issuance of certificates of occupancy; to establish a fee
schedule for inspections; to authorize the vacation or condemnation of dwelling
structures that are unsafe or unfit for human habitation; and to fix penalties
for violations of this Code. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and
essential for the public interest, and it is intended that this Code be
liberally construed to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.

   (c)   Issuance of Certificate; Conditions. If the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines that access is deemed absolutely necessary to accomplish or complete
repairs or improvements necessary for compliance with this Code, then the Board
shall issue a certificate of necessity, setting forth therein the person to
whom the certificate shall apply, such conditions as shall be necessary to
protect the adjoining property, reasonable time limits during which such
certificate shall operate, precautions to be taken to avoid damages and, where
the Board deems proper, a bond to be procured at the expense of any person
seeking access to insure the adjoining property against damage to persons or
property arising out of such right of access. The bond shall not exceed an
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), unless conditions deemed advisable
by the Board appear otherwise, and the amount set shall take into consideration
the extent, nature and duration of the repairs, the proximity of the
improvement to the premises affected and the potential risk of damage thereto.
The bond shall be filed with the Property Maintenance Officer.
   (d)   Procedure Where Access is Refused. Any refusal to comply with this
section, or any interference with access to premises pursuant to a certificate
issued hereunder, shall be a violation of this Code, and, in addition to
penalties provided hereunder, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon an
affidavit, apply to the Parma Municipal Court for a warrant under the procedure
set forth in Section
1490.16(b), authorizing access to the premises under appropriate conditions and
circumstances as provided under division (c) of this section.
(Ord. 122-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
1491.27   PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT; NOTICE; APPEAL.
   (a)   The certificate of housing inspection, as provided for in Section
1491.25, shall specify the violation committed, what must be done to correct
the same, a period of ten days to correct or abate the violation, and the right
of the person served to request a hearing. The notice shall become an order of
the Property Maintenance Officer 5 days after service, unless a hearing is
requested pursuant to division (c) of this section.
   (b)   Service of Notice. The issuance of a certificate of housing inspection
shall serve as notice to the owner or operator of a violation of this Code.
Issuance of a certificate of housing inspection shall be effectuated by
personal service, by prepaid telegram or by mail, with postage prepaid,
addressed to the last known address of the person to be served. Where it is
ascertained that the owner or operator to whom the certificate of housing
inspection is directed does not reside on the premises, the last known address
shall be the address of the owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor.
If the last known address cannot be ascertained, the certificate of housing
inspection may be posted on the outside front entrance of the building. The
Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice to any owner,
operator or agent of any violation at any address other than the last known
address as provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the Officer
personally or by certified mail addressed to the Officer. The date of service
of the notice shall be determined where service is by mail as of the day
following the day of mailing for notices to addresses within the Village, and
as of the fourth day after the day of mailing for notices to addresses outside
the Village. Where the day of service would fall upon a Sunday or other day
when mail is not ordinarily delivered, then the day of service shall be the
next regular delivery day. Notwithstanding any other provisions contained
herein, where premises are subject to registration pursuant to Section
1491.22 and have been so registered, notice served upon the agent designated
therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator and lessor of the
premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner, operator or lessor has failed
to register the premises as required under Section
1491.22, or if the present premises have been registered and the agent
designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the registration,
the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting the
certificate of housing inspection upon the premises in a conspicuous place as
near as possible to the front entrance thereof.
   (c)   When Notice Becomes a Final Order; Request for Hearing. Within 5 days
of the date of service of a certificate of housing inspection, the certificate
shall constitute a final order, unless any person affected by the notice
requests a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals and serves a written
request within the 5-day period, in person or by mail, on the Chairperson of
the Board. Such request for a hearing before the Board shall set forth briefly
the grounds or reasons on which the request for a hearing is based and the
factual matters contained in the notice of violation which are to be disputed
at the hearing. The Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request,
shall, within ten days therefrom and upon 5 days notice to the party aggrieved,
set the matter down for hearing.
   (d)   Determination at Hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Chairperson of the Board shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by issuance and
service of subpoenas, to required by subpoena the production of books, records
or other documents at any such hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be
determined by him or her and to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order
for the enforcement of any such subpoena as provided by law. Determination
shall be made within ten days from the completion of the hearing. The Board
shall issue an order either incorporating the determinations and directions
contained in the certificate of housing inspection, modifying the same or
withdrawing the certificate of housing inspection.
   (e)   Extension of Time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the
time for correction or abatement of the violations for an additional period of
time not to exceed ten days, except where major capital improvements or
renovations are involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period not to exceed 30 days beyond the expiration date of the
original certificate of housing inspection.
   (f)   Noncompliance With Notice.
      (1)   Whenever the owner, agent, occupant or operator of a structure or
premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with any certificate of housing
inspection of the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final order as
provided in division (c) of this section, the Officer or such designated
representative may issue a notice to such owner, agent, occupant or operator
ordering the structure or premises, or part thereof, to be vacated, repaired or
improved within such time as shall be stated in such notice, but which shall be
not less than ten days, except in cases of emergency, or the Property
Maintenance Officer may advise the Law Director of the circumstances and
request the Law Director to institute an appropriate action at law to compel
compliance. Such notice shall be provided in accordance with division (b) and
(c) of this section.
      (2)   Whenever the owner, operator, occupant or agent of a structure or
premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with a notice to vacate issued by
the Property Maintenance Officer, the Officer may enforce the orders of such
notice of vacation and cause the structure or premises, or part thereof, to be
vacated in accordance with the terms of such notice.
      (3)   Whenever the owner, operator, or agent of a structure fails,
neglects or refuses to comply with a notice to demolish such structure, issued
in accordance with the provisions of this Code, and when such a structure or
part thereof is determined by the Property Maintenance Officer to constitute a
public nuisance in that it is dangerous or injurious to the public health,
safety or welfare, the Property Maintenance Officer may request the Law
Director to institute legal proceedings or take other action as may be
necessary to abate the nuisance. The Property Maintenance Officer shall further
give notice informing the owner, operator or agent of such determination and
action. Such notice shall be provided in accordance with division (b) and (c)
of this section.
      (4)   Any owner of any such property as to which such an order or notice
to repair, improve, demolish or vacate has been issued shall not sell or enter
into an agreement to sell or lease such property for longer than one year
unless such order of the Property Maintenance Officer has been disclosed and
displayed to the prospective purchaser or lessee, or unless such owner has
received notice from the Officer of satisfactory compliance with such order or
notice from the Officer or other duly constituted authority that such order has
been withdrawn or canceled.
   (g)   Referral of Violations. A violation of any ordinance other than this
Code discovered by the Property Maintenance Officer or his or her
representative shall be reported to the official or agency responsible for the
enforcement of such ordinance.
   (h)   Where Notice and Hearing Not Required Prior to Court Proceedings.

Code, the service of a certificate of housing inspection on an owner, whether

and other applicable ordinances of the Village.
(Ord. 122-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
1491.28   CASES OF EMERGENCY.
   Whenever, in the opinion of the Property Maintenance Officer, the condition
of a structure or premises, or part thereof, constitutes an immediate hazard to
human life or health, he shall declare a case of emergency and shall order
immediate vacation of the structure or premises or part thereof. Such notice
shall be served in the manner provided in Section
1491.27 (b) and (c), but shall require immediate compliance.
(Ord. 122-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
1491.29   PLACARDS.

part thereof, to be vacated, the Officer shall cause to be posted at each
entrance to such structure or premises, or part thereof, a placard warning of
the existence of such vacation order. No person shall deface or remove such
placard without the written permission of the Property Maintenance Officer
until the repair or demolition is completed. No person shall enter or use any
structure or premises so placarded except for the purpose of making the
required repairs or demolishing the structure or premises.
