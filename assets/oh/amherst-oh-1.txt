EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the 1971 Codified Ordinances of Amherst
was either ordinances or resolutions previously enacted by City Council, or new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the 1971 Codified
Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new matter
ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of
all source material in the 1971 Amherst Codified Ordinances is indicated.

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under

(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.98 COMMUNITY SERVICE WORK IN LIEU OF IMPRISONMENT OR FINE.
   (a)   Upon the motion of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to
a misdemeanor, the court may in its discretion require that person to perform
supervised community service work under authority to the City in lieu of
imprisonment, the payment of a fine, the payment of court costs, or any
combination thereof. In the event that such a person is ordered to perform
supervised community service work under the authority of the City in lieu of
the payment of a fine, court costs, or any combination thereof, the Court shall
designate the hourly rate for community service work at which the fine or court
cost shall be reduced. The following do not control the court’s discretion, but
shall be considered in favor of allowing an offender to perform supervised
community service work in lieu of imprisonment or the payment of a fine:
      (1)   The offense did not cause property damage or personal injury to
others;
      (2)   The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;
      (3)   The offender has no history of prior delinquency or criminal
activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period before
commission of the present offense;
      (4)   The character and attitude of the offender indicate that he is
unlikely to commit another offense;
      (5)   Imprisonment of the offender will entail undue hardship to himself
or his dependents.
   (b)   All individuals ordered to perform community service work under this
section shall report to the Police Department to be assigned for work in
supervision in various departments throughout the City.
(Ord. 89-35. Passed 6-12-89.)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter 103. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

   137.06 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   The City of Amherst recognizes the efficiency and convenience afforded
the day-to-day operation of the City through the use of credit cards. However,
credit cards are not to be used to circumvent the general purchasing procedures
required by State law and City policies. A purchase order must be in place
prior to the use of a credit card. Credit cards are defined as any bank issued
credit card account, store issued credit card account, financial institution-
issued credit card account, financial depository-issued credit card account, or
any other card or credit account allowing the holder to purchase goods or
services on credit or to transact with the account, and any debit or gift card
account related to the receipt of grant moneys.
   (b)   The Council apppoints the Deputy Treasurer as the compliance officer.
Quarterly the compliance officer will review the number of cards the City has,
the number of active cards the city has, the expiration dates and the credit
limit for each card. This information will be provided to City Council for
review.
   (c)   The City Auditor or designee will be responsible for issuing,
reissuing, and cancelling all credit cards. No more than one credit card per
person will be issued.
   (d)   Credit Cards.
      (1)   The City name must appear on each card associated with the credit
card account.
      (2)   The City Auditor or designee will provide an annual report to the
Council detailing all rewards received based on use of the credit card account.

guarantees for the staff. Such expenses are subject to the reimbursement limits
established by the Council.
      (5)   With approval through the purchase order process, credit cards may
be used by city employees for city-related purchases from a vendor who does not
accept purchase orders or vouchers or as authorized by the City Auditor.
      (6)   Gratuities are not permissible.
      (7)   All credit card statements shall be sent directly to the City
Auditor's office. The City Auditor shall keep a record of all credit card use.
      (8)   Receipts and appropriate form(s) shall be turned in with the credit
card to the City Auditor. Receipts for meals must include the names of all
individuals for whom meals were provided and the purpose of the meeting.
Failure to turn in receipts and appropriate form(s) to the City Auditor in a
timely manner will result in the charges being deemed unrelated or
unsubstantiated. The user shall be responsible for any unsubstantiated or
unrelated purchases. Any late fees assessed to the City due to an employee
failing to submit invoices and credit card receipts on a timely basis shall be
the responsibility of the employee.
      (9)   All authorized users must immediately report loss or theft of the
City credit card to the City Auditor or designee who will immediately contact
the credit card issuer.
      (10)   The use of the credit card for the following items is considered
unauthorized use and classified as credit card misuse:
         A.   Expenditures not specifically authorized by this policy;
         B.   Purchase of personal goods or services for an employee, an
employee's spouse, children or anyone employed or not employed by the City and
attending a City business function;

including termination. An employee or officer of the Council who knowingly
misuses a City credit card account may also be in violation of State criminal
law. (Ord. O-19-07. Passed 1-28-19.)

covered account, restoring a covered account or accepting payment for a covered
account shall check for red flags as indicators of possible identity theft and
such red flags may include:

report;
      (2)   A notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer
report;
      (3)   A notice of address discrepancy provided by a consumer reporting
agency;
      (4)   Indications of a pattern of activity in a consumer report that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:

listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the

associated with known fraudulent applications or activities as indicated by
internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor.
      (4)   Other information provided, such as fictitious mailing address,
mail drop addresses, jail addresses, invalid phone numbers, pager numbers or

to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of applicants or customers.
      (7)   The applicant or customer fails to provide all required personal
identifying information on an application or in response to notification that
the application is incomplete.
      (8)   Personal identifying information is not consistent with personal
identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or
creditor.
      (9)   The applicant or customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
   (d)   Unusual use of or suspicious activity relating to a covered account.
Examples of suspicious activity include:
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for an account,
City receives a request for the addition of authorized users on the account.

         B.   A material change in purchasing or spending patterns.
      (4)   An account that has been inactive for a long period of time is used

accounts.
      (Ord. 09-20. Passed 4-27-09.)
   151.09  PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF IDENTITY THEFT.
   (a)   In the event that any City employee responsible for or involved in
restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered
account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with
respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her
discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags
suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such
employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely
or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the
Safety-Service Director. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that
identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the
Superintendent of the department providing the service for which the covered
account is created, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further
action is necessary. If the Superintendent in his or her discretion determines
that further action is necessary, a City employee shall perform one or more of
the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the Superintendent:
      (1)   Contact the customer;
      (2)   Make the following changes to the account if, after contacting the
customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the
customer's covered account:
         A.   Change any account numbers, passwords, security codes, or other
security devices that permit access to an account; or
         B.   Close the account;
      (3)   Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer and
decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that
the customer's account has been accessed without authorization and such access
has caused additional charges to accrue;
      (4)   Notify a debt collector within 24 hours of the discovery of likely
or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to
such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a
debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of
identity theft relating to such account;
      (5)   Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the
customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to
accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or
      (6)   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity
theft.
   (b)   In the event that any City employee responsible for or involved in
opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible
identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee
shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or
combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her
discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity
theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red
flags to the Superintendent of his department. If, in his or her discretion,
such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable
information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this
information to the Superintendent of his department, who may in his or her
discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the Superintendent
in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a City
employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to
be appropriate by the Superintendent:
      (1)   Request additional identifying information from the applicant;
      (2)   Deny the application for the new account;
      (3)   Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or
      (4)   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity
theft.

training necessary. (Ord. 09-20. Passed 4-27-09.)
   151.12 OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS.
   In the event that the City engages a service provider to perform an activity
in connection with one or more covered accounts the Superintendent of the
department providing the service for which the covered account is created shall
exercise his or her discretion in reviewing such arrangements in order to
ensure, to the best of his or her ability, that the service provider's
activities are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures, agreed

the user of a substantial difference between the address for the consumer that
the user provided to request the consumer report and the address(es) in the
agency's file for the consumer. (See 16 CFR § 681.1(b).) (Ord. 09-20. Passed 4-
27-09.)
   153.04 POLICY.
   In the event that the City receives a notice of address discrepancy, the
City employee responsible for verifying consumer addresses for the purpose of
providing the municipal service or account sought by the consumer shall perform
one or more of the following activities, as determined to be appropriate by
such employee:
   (a)   Compare the information in the consumer report with:

identity in accordance with the requirements of the Customer Information
Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l);

(Ord. 09-20. Passed 4-27-09.)
   153.05 FURNISHING CONSUMER'S ADDRESS TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY.
   (a)   In the event that the City reasonably confirms that an address
provided by a consumer to the City is accurate, the City is required to provide
such address to the consumer reporting agency from which the City received a
notice of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information
is required to be provided to the consumer reporting agency when:
      (1)   The City is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer
report relates to the consumer about whom the City requested the report;
      (2)   The City establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and
      (3)   The City regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides
information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice
of address discrepancy.
   (b)   Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as
part of the information regularly provided by the City to such agency for the
reporting period in which the City establishes a relationship with the
customer.

      (4)    A.   The portion attributable to the City of the net profits

profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or transactions with such division, branch, factory,
office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he shall make such

income against which the taxpayer has taken a deduction for federal income tax
purposes as reportable on the taxpayers Form 2106, and against which a like
deduction has not been allowed by the City, the taxpayer shall deduct from
taxable income an amount equal to the deduction shown on such form allowable
against such income, to the extent not otherwise so allowed as a deduction by
the City. In the case of a taxpayer who has a net profit from a business or
profession that is operated as a sole proprietorship, taxable income shall not
be greater than the net profit reported by the taxpayer on Schedule C, filed
with the federal income tax return in reference to the year in question except
as otherwise specifically provided by ordinance or regulation.
(Ord. 83-57. Passed 11-14-83.)
   191.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   Earned income tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and with respect to the net
profits of persons, businesses, professions or other activities earned from
January 1, 1968, to and including the date of revocation of this chapter.
(Ord. 67-50. Passed 9-25-67.)
   191.05 RETURNS AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax
is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15, 1968, of the year
following the effective date of this chapter, and on or before April 30 of each
year until December 31, 2003. When the return is made for a fiscal year or
other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within
four months from the end of such fiscal year until December 31, 2003. For
taxable years beginning after 2003, except as otherwise provided in 718.051 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and division (D) of that section, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to file an annual income tax return or report on any date
other than the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer’s taxable year. The Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of
tax deducted by such compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to
the Administrator, shall be accepted as the return required of any employee
whose sole income subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages,
commissions or other compensation.
(Ord. 04-89. Passed 10-25-04.)
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Administrator setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned;
      (2)   The gross income from a business, profession or other activity less
allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income. Such
income shall include only income earned during the year, or portion thereof,
covered by the return and subject to the tax imposed by this chapter;
      (3)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits;
      (4)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on income reported;
      (5)   Any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under the
provisions of Sections
191.07,
191.08 and
191.16; and
      (6)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require.
         (Ord. 67-50. Passed 9-25-67.)
   (c)    Prior to December 31, 2003, the Administrator may extend the time for
filing of the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of
not to exceed to six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal income
tax return. The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due, by the date the return is
normally due. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return
is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended. For taxable
years beginning after 2003, the extended due date of the municipal income tax
return shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the due
date of the federal income tax return has been extended. The City may deny a
taxpayer’s request for extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the
request, fails to file a copy of the request for the federal extension, owes,
the City any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest, assessment, or
other charge for the last payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to
file any required income tax return, report, or other related document for a
prior tax period. The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax
return does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless
the City grants an extension of that date.
(Ord. 05- 35. Passed 4-25-05.)
   (d)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing, pay to the
Administrator the balance of tax due, if any, after deducting:
      (1)   The amount of City income tax deducted or withheld at the source
pursuant to Section
191.07;
      (2)   Such portion of the tax as has been paid on declaration by the
taxpayer pursuant to Section
191.08; and
      (3)   Any credit allowable under the provisions of Section
191.16.
   Should the return or the records of the Administrator indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any existing
liability and the balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer communicated
to the Administrator, shall be refunded or transferred against any subsequent
liability. However, overpayments of less than three dollars ($3.00) shall not
be refunded.
(Ord. 05-26. Passed 3-14-05.)
   191.06 AMENDED RETURNS.
   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and to pay additional tax due, or to claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
191.12 and
191.16. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such filing determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 67-50. Passed 9-25-67.)
   191.07 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    Each employer within or doing business within the City who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis
shall, at the time of payment thereof, deduct the tax authorized under this
chapter from the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due
by the employer to the employee. Nonresident businesses are required to
withhold and remit the tax in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
   (b)   Each such employer shall, on or before the last day of the month
following each calendar quarter, make a return and remit to the City the tax
hereby required to be withheld. Such return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the
rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the Administrator. Such employer
shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. Any tax deducted and
withheld is to be considered paid to the City for purposes of determining
employee payments or credits.
   (c)   On or before January 31 following any calendar year such employer
shall file with the Administrator an information return for such employee from
whom City income tax has been or should have been withheld, showing the name,
address and social security number of the employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of City income tax withheld
from such employee.
   (d)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and any such tax collected by the employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of the employer. The officer or employee having control or
supervision or charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing
the return and making the payment shall be personally liable, jointly and
severally, for the failure to file the return or failure to pay the tax due as
required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any such
employer does not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a prior
failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
(Ord. 10-55. Passed 10-25-10.)
   191.08  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
191.07 or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
191.03, may file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any, provided, however, that if a person's income

City in accordance with Section
191.07, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)    The declaration should be filed on or before April 30 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or within four months of the date the taxpayer
becomes subject to the tax for the first time.
   (c)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis should file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (d)    The declaration may be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable
from the Administrator. Credit shall be taken for City income tax to be
withheld, if any, from any portion of such income. In addition, credit may be
taken for tax payable to other taxing municipalities in accordance with the
provisions of Section
191.16.
(Ord. 01-126. Passed 11-26-01.)
   (e)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as

pursuant to Section
191.07;
      (2)    Any credits allowable under the provisions of Section
191.16; and
      (3)    Any overpayment of the previous year's tax liability, which the
taxpayer has not elected to have refunded.
   (g)    At least a similar amount may be paid on or before the last day of
the sixth, ninth and twelfth month after the beginning of the taxpayer's
taxable year, provided that in case an amended declaration has been duly filed,
or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of the year only, the unpaid balance
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
(Ord. 01-126. Passed 11-26-01.)
   (h)   On or before the last day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due to the City shall be
paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
191.06.
(Ord. 67-50. Passed 9-25-67.)
   191.09 DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to receive the tax imposed
by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, from the taxpayers, to keep an
accurate record thereof and to report all moneys so received.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Administrator to enforce payment of all
taxes owing the City, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years

payments thereof.

conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such

taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid

provisions of Sections
191.12 and
191.13 shall apply.
   (e)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator

and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax
so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (f)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulation approved by such Board, the Administrator shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by Section
191.11.

verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to

withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   
   (e)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
192.06 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small

the preceding taxable year.
   
   (f)    Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the

      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Amherst to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same

involving one or more of the following:

192.41 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of Section
192.41 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
            (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (d)    For the purposes of
192.145 and division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as

promotion of sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion.
             (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused
to the municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in
the municipal corporation.
           (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the
sale of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to
the municipal corporation.
            (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents

extent to which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal
corporation.
      (e)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
      A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)    (1)    Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
           (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation
that imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit
from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
192.19 of this Chapter.
    (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)L. of Section
192.06 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

         A.   “Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of the City of Amherst. An employee or owner
may have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an

or owner under division (a)(1)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
                      3.    If no reporting location exists in this state for
an employee or owner under division (a)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
           (2)    A.    A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this
division to the apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession.
For taxpayers that make this election, the provisions of Section
192.14 apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this
division.
                 B.    A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this
division in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if
applicable, a timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal
of an assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that
return or appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the
taxpayer revokes the election.
          C.    The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax

apportionment provisions authorized in Section
192.14, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax return for that
taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the Tax Administrator
of a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is

employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
                 D.    After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the
election applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts
business. The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with

qualifying remote work location is located in the City of Amherst.
                 E.    Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from making
a new election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
            (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in
Section
192.14(a), all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the election
described in division
192.145(a)(2)A.:
                 A.    For the purpose of Section

work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
                 B.    For the purpose of Section
192.14(a)(2), any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.

192.14(a)(3), and notwithstanding Section
192.14(d), any gross receipts of the business or profession from services
performed during the taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner
for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
            (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from
requesting, or the Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use,
with respect to all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method as described in Section
192.14. However, the Tax Administrator shall not require an alternative
apportionment method in such a manner that it would require a taxpayer to file
a net profit return with solely because a qualifying remote employee's or
owner's qualifying remote work location is located in the City of Amherst.
            (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in
this division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying
wages pursuant to Sections
192.07,
192.11, and
192.14.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the municipal tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (e)    (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and
(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.06(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
192.06 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.14 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.14 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
192.14 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
                  B.    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
192.14 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes
are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(g) of Section
192.23 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first
time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
            (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
  
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of Amherst
or Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated
taxes and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as
follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)A. through
D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
192.23 of this Chapter.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.29 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
192.23 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Amherst
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.19 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   It is the intent of this section that a resident who pays tax to
another municipality shall not pay tax to the City of Amherst on the same
income in excess of one-half of one percent (1/2%). When a resident is subject
to, and has paid or acknowledged tax liability for, a municipal income tax in
another municipality on the same income taxable under this chapter, such
resident may claim a credit of the amount of such tax paid to such other
municipality, but not in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the tax assessed by
this chapter; provided, that if the rate of tax assessed by this chapter is
increased, the credit allowed by this section shall be increased by a like
amount.
  
   (b)   If the taxpayers' taxable income, as reported on their W-2 Statements
as paid or reportable to the City of Amherst includes income subject to the
taxing power of another municipality's jurisdiction and the tax was in fact
paid to the other municipality, then a credit shall be given pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof. Necessary rules and regulations regarding this procedure
shall be as promulgated by the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.20 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (3)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If
different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying
tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted
average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the non qualified
deferred compensation plan.
  
   (c)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.21 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The City of Amherst shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
192.19 of this Chapter. (Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.22 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the City of Amherst, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the City of Amherst as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
192.28 of this Chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the City of
Amherst, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be
subject to collection and recovery by the City of Amherst. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
192.28, the City of Amherst will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other against the income tax the City of Amherst
claims is due. If the City of Amherst's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the City of Amherst, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
192.28 of this Chapter.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
192.19 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.23 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the City of Amherst shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the City of Amherst under subsection
192.10(c) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the City
of Amherst.
            (3)    All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and
older, shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the City of
Amherst, regardless of income or liability.
   
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City of Amherst in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided the City of Amherst. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City of Amherst to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (f) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(g) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City of Amherst
or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City of Amherst or
Tax Administrator.
                  C.    In the case of individual income tax return required to
be filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be
filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the
amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less. The City of Amherst shall not
require a qualifying employee whose income consists exclusively of exempt
income described in Section
192.06(a)(11)T. to file a return under this section.
            (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Amherst in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
192.24 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
192.24 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
192.24 of this Chapter prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City of Amherst
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City of
Amherst for a taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall
file with the City of Amherst an annual net profit return under division (f)
(3) and ( 4) of this section.
   
   (i)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the City of Amherst by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.10 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as
credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the City of Amherst and the recipient colluded
with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to
remit the amounts withheld.
  
   (k)   Each return required by the City of Amherst to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the City of Amherst shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the City
of Amherst in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the City of Amherst or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
City of Amherst's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
192.11 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
            The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement:
            "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the
municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the City of Amherst in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.24  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (a)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of
Amherst for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension
of time for payment of taxes required by the City of Amherst in accordance with
this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service and
for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(b)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
            (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the City of Amherst before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
            (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under
division (b) (1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with
those taxes for the extension period.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of Amherst in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (c) (2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                  B.    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance
with division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   
   (b)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
192.41 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by (a)(2) of this section for
filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period prescribed in
that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division. If
the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund need be paid by the
City of Amherst to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state
income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
192.28 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section,
the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
            (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
            (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.40 of this Chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
192.29 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
192.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
192.37 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

or in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the City of Amherst as authorized by ORC 718 or the
charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the City of

or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,

(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.38 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed.
   The written response of the Tax Administrator shall be an "opinion of the
Tax Administrator" and shall bind the Tax Administrator, in accordance with
divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this section, provided all of the following
conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the City of Amherst in
accordance with this Chapter.
            (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the City of
Amherst's income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the City of Amherst's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the City of Amherst in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
192.37 of this Chapter.
   (e)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
            (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
            (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (f) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.39 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
            (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within
sixty days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.40 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the City of Amherst shall maintain
a Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
City of Amherst, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the City of Amherst at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the City of Amherst. This member may be an
employee of the City of Amherst, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the City of Amherst shall be two years. There is
no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.
         The board member appointed by the top administrative official of the
City of Amherst shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 24-09. Passed 2-26-24.)
   192.41  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.40 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
    (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Amherst does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
192.40 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
192.28 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

Amherst, pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to

levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (b)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (c)    "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
and who furnishes the lodging.
      (Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   For the sole purpose of providing revenue for the purchase of land and
capital improvement for City parks in the City, an excise tax is hereby levied
on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests.
   The tax is three percent of the amount paid or to be paid by the transient
guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time the
lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax
does not apply to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political
subdivisions.
   For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions of this
chapter, and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging
furnished by hotels in this City to transient guests is subject to the tax
until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The City Treasurer shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid directly by the transient guest to the City Treasurer, or his agent, he
shall refund it to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the
City Auditor, on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date
it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous.
However, in any event such application for refund must be filed with the
Auditor within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of
the tax. On filing of such application the Auditor shall determine the amount
of refund due and certify such amount to the Treasurer. The Auditor shall draw
a warrant for such certified amount on the Treasurer to the person claiming
such refund. The Treasurer shall make such payments from a tax refund as
established by ordinance.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.05 RECORDS: INSPECTION AND RETENTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the City Auditor, and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in writing, consents
to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)

   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of July, 1972, and on or before
the last day of each month thereafter, make and file a return for the preceding
month, on forms prescribed by the Auditor, showing the receipts from furnishing
lodging, the amount of tax due from the vendor to the City for the period
covered by the return and such other information as the Auditor deems
necessary, for the proper administration of this chapter. The Auditor may
extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by
mailing the same to the City Treasurer, together with payment of the amount of
tax shown to be due thereon.
   The Auditor may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as to
merit monthly returns, as determined by the Auditor upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   The Treasurer shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date received
by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of payment
received with the return. Thereafter, the Treasurer shall immediately transmit
all returns filed under this chapter to the Auditor. Any vendor who fails to
file a return under this chapter shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit and
pay into the City Treasury the sum of ten dollars ($10.00).
   The Auditor, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the
tax imposed by this chapter may require returns and payments to be made for
other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or his
authorized agent.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.07 LIABILITY OF HOTEL AND TRANSIENT GUEST; ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR
REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter and
fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Auditor may make
an assessment against such vendor based upon any information in the Auditor's
possession.
   If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails to pay
the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject to
the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of the tax applicable for the transaction. The Auditor may make an
assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or pursuant
to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge the
transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable to
such transaction.
   In each case the Auditor shall give to the vendor or transient guest
assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the
vendor or resident guest assessed personally or by registered or certified
mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to an
assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been
paid by another.
   The Auditor may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to file a
return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of tax in
accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the Auditor
indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be, greater
than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Auditor may upon the basis of test
checks of a vendor's business for a representative period which are hereby
authorized, determine the ratio which the tax required to be collected under
this chapter bears to the hotel's lodgings, which determination shall be the
basis of an assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such
assessment shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom the notice of assessment is
directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or
by registered mail or certified mail a petition in writing, verified under oath
by the vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent, having knowledge of
the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment
objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, the assessment
shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from
the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the City Treasurer. When a
petition for reassessment is filed, the Auditor shall assign a time and place
for the hearing of the same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by
registered or certified mail, but the Auditor may continue the hearings from
time to time if necessary.
   A penalty of fifteen percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Auditor may adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to assessments
made under this chapter.
   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment as
provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Auditor, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.08 FOUR YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)    When the Auditor has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes
collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not returned to
the City; or
   (b)    When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
      (Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.09 TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE OF
TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.10 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITIONS AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or
make, in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which
might imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient
guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including
the tax, or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.11 REPORTS MUST BE FILED; PROHIBITIONS AGAINST FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)    No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)    If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Auditor to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Auditor may:
   Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the average
tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by the
Auditor from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such
vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars
($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be
applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond,
satisfactory to the Auditor, conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the
returns from the vendor. The security must be filed within ten days following
the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Auditor of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS AND/OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers and/or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)
   193.13 INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent on
transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(c). Accordingly, the
provisions of this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so
as to be consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 72-32. Passed 6-26-72.)

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to

in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and
width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall
drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of

         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been

R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or

wireless communications device.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
 
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution. "It is for
you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness
stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its
lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

first shall be applied to pay the expenses incurred with regard to the care of
the animal from the time it was taken from the custody of the former owner. The
balance of the proceeds from the sale, if any, shall be paid to the former
owner of the animal.

be made at the discretion of the police officer based on proximity of the
destination and the other relevant factors, and subject to the need to respond

seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of    conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to
conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all
interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist
them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done
during such initial conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board

conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and
the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a
violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the
respondent a written statement of charges and summons and shall serve upon all
interested parties a notice of the time and place of the meeting. The
respondent or his authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with

party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of the

against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

   755.01 COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS.
   No person or business shall install, erect, insert, attach, build, create or
otherwise use any alarm system which by electronic, radio, automatic or
mechanical means on the occurrence of a given event, circumstance or condition
transmits a signal or voice communication for reception by the Amherst Police
Department unless the requirements hereinafter set forth in Section
755.02 have been complied with.
(Ord. 78-46. Passed 7-24-78.)
   755.02 PERMIT APPLICATION; APPROVAL CONDITIONS AND FEE; EXISTING
INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)    The installation of any alarm system in any building, residence,
warehouse, showroom, factory, commercial building or at any location whatsoever
within the City, causing a signal or voice communication to be transmitted for
reception by the Amherst Police Department alarm panel may be permitted only
upon written application to the Director of Public Safety or his authorized
representative and approval by him or his representative of the application as
indicated by the issuance of a permit per such installation.
   (b)    It shall be a condition of the approval of such application that the
applicant:
      (1)    Install of his own expense, at a location determined by the City
Police Department or Fire Department a telephone line, radio or other such
instrument as may be required to receive the signal or voice communication
message transmitted by the alarm unit. All installation, maintenance, service,
operating and continuing costs of the receiving instrument shall be borne by
the applicant. Proof of the current payment of all charges thereon shall be
presented to the Director of Public Safety by January 30 of each year that such
unit remains in operation.

proof of current payment for issuance or renewal of an installation permit.
   (c)    Any residence or lawful business located within the City may be
equipped with an alarm system for the purpose of detecting and signaling the
presence of a fire or unauthorized intrusion upon compliance with this chapter.
Existing installations shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter
including those pertaining to permits, penalties and fees.

   755.03 CONNECTION APPROVAL; NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   (a)    Connection to the Police Department alarm panel as provided for in
Section
755.02 shall be contingent upon the applicant having obtained permission from
the company which maintains the alarm panel system in the Police Station to
make such connection. Permission to connect shall not be denied provided
equipment is compatible, provided charges are paid to such company, and
provided that installation is inspected and approved by the Chief of Police or
his authorized representative.
   (b)    The City will, within its capabilities, endeavor to accommodate every
reasonable application for connection to the Police Department alarm panel as
provided for in subsection (a) hereof. The acceptance of an installation,
issuance of a permit and approval shall not constitute acceptance by the City
of any liability connected with equipment maintenance, answering alarms or for
anything contained herein.

shall meet the applicable standards of the Underwriters Laboratories and/or the
National Fire Protection Association, and/or any other recognized industry
standard. The applicant may be required to submit evidence of the reliability
and suitability of the equipment to be installed.
   (b)    The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices shall be
adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusions, so that the
devices will not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure change in
water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or
vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation, or
other forces unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)    Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an
automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City shall furnish such person with instructions as to the way the device
operates, along with maintenance instructions.
   (d)    Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an
automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises in the
City for which a permit is required shall provide for receiving calls for
service directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four hour basis and seven
days a week, and shall respond to such calls within eight hours of the time
they are received.
   (e)    At the time of installation, each alarm equipment supplier shall
furnish to the person for whom an automatic protection device has been
installed, written information as to how service can be obtained at any time,
including the telephone number to call for service. Such person shall be
responsible for having the device repaired as quickly as possible after he
learns, either from his own sources or from notification by the Chief of
Police, that the device is not working properly.
   (f)   The Chief of Police, Fire Chief or any officer designated by them
shall have the authority, at reasonable times and upon oral notice, to enter
upon any premises within the City, to inspect the installation and operation of
an automatic protection device or signaling device, the purpose of which is to
report an emergency to the Police Station.
   (g)    All equipment, the use or installation of which is subject to this
chapter, shall be maintained in good operating condition. The Chief of Police
may require that repairs be made whenever he has determined that such are
necessary to assure reliability of operation.
(Ord. 78-46. Passed 7-24-78.)
   755.05 DISCONNECTION AND SERVICE TERMINATION.
   The receiving unit shall be permitted to remain for only so long as it does
not interfere with the normal daily operation of the Police and Fire
Departments. Upon the determination by the Director of Public Safety that such
alarm system is not an aid to preventing crime or the apprehension of
criminals, fighting fires, or that it is disrupting or interfering with the
daily operation of the Police or Fire Departments, the Director is authorized
to cause the immediate disconnection, termination and removal of such unit.
(Ord. 78-46. Passed 7-24-78.)
   755.06 EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS.
   (a)   When the number of false alarms received by the Police Department or
Fire Department from any one alarm system (either directly via transmission of
an alarm signal by such installation to the Police Department or Fire
Department alarm panel or indirectly as a result of a notification from a
monitoring company) exceeds three (3) during any twelve-month calendar year,
then the owner of the alarm system shall be fined twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
for each additional false alarm up to and including the sixth (6) false alarm
received during such twelve- month period, and fifty dollars ($50.00) for the
seventh (7) and eighth (8) alarm during such twelve-month period and one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each additional false alarm after the eighth
(8th) false alarm received during such twelve-month period.
   (b)   Division (a) of this section shall not apply to false alarms received
during the test period of a system.

received by the Police Department or Fire Department that is not the result of
an actual emergency incident for which the alarm was intended.

mean the period commencing on the date such system is first installed or
substantially modified and ending thirty (30) days thereafter.

collection system of a structure on private property to the main line of the
Amherst sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   “Road property” means any property that is within a dedicated and
accepted street right-of-way and that is either under the improved roadway
surface or within twelve inches of the curb or improved roadway surface.
      (3)   “Damage” to a lateral means the collapse of a sewer tile or tiles
that obstructs the flow of effluent in the sewer line or a separation of tiles
that causes an obstruction in the flow of effluent in the sewer line.
      (4)   “Road property lateral repair work” means:

         B.   Opening, closing and returning the roadway to its former state;
and
         C.   Repairing or replacing line materials that lie within the road
property.
      (5)   “Routine maintenance and cleaning” means removal of tree roots,
foreign objects, accumulated grease or other obstructions that do not fall
within the definition of damage as defined in this section.
   (b)   Determination of Damage. For the purposes of this section, the only
acceptable method of identifying damage to a lateral shall be the use of an in-
line video camera system or comparable technology approved by the
Superintendent of Utilities, with the results recorded on video tape or disk.
   (c)   Applicability. In cases where there is determined to be a damage to
that portion of a lateral that lies within road property the City may, at the
discretion of the Safety/Service Director, pay all or part of the costs of the
road property lateral repair work. Such assistance shall only be paid if:
      (1)   The property owner or resident has engaged a professional plumber
who, using an in-line video system, has examined the entire lateral and
certified that there is damage to the portion of the lateral leading into the
resident’s home that lies within road property, and such plumber has provided a
copy of a video tape or disk of the examination of the entire lateral to the
Superintendent of Utilities for review.
      (2)   The Superintendent of Utilities has examined the report of the
plumber and/or video tape or disk produced by the in-line camera and concurs
that there is damage requiring repairs in that part of the lateral that lies
within road property.
      (3)   The Superintendent of Utilities is not of the opinion that damage
to such lateral is due to failure of the property owner to maintain the lateral
or abusive or over-aggressive attempts by the property owner or someone engaged
by the property owner to remove blockages.
   (d)   Allocation of Repair Costs and Responsibilities. 
      (1)   If the Safety/Service Director approves the payment of all or part
of the costs of certain road property lateral repair work, then the property
owner may elect to have the repairs in road property performed by a licensed
private contractor and seek reimbursement from the City for the approved costs
or the property owner may request that the work be performed by City employees,
and, if the City’s cost of performing such work exceeds the amount the City has
agreed to pay, then the property owner shall reimburse the City for the excess.
The Superintendent of Utilities shall be responsible for determining if and
when City employees are available to work on projects covered under this
section. The use of private contractors must be approved in advance by the
Superintendent of Utilities and the City shall not reimburse the property owner
for an amount that exceeds what the City’s real and actual costs would be if
the road property lateral repair work had been performed by City employees as
determined by the Safety Service Director.
      (2)   If the video tape provided by the property owner also identifies
significant damage to that portion of the lateral that lies between the clean-
out and the edge of road property, the property owner shall, at such property
owner’s sole cost and expense, cause such damage to be repaired at the same
time as the repairs are being made on that portion of the lateral that lies
within road property.
      (3)   Work to repair any portion of a lateral outside road property may
not be performed by City employees.

any portion of a lateral that lies outside road property at such property
owner’s sole cost and expense.
   (e)   Routine Maintenance and Cleaning. The property owner shall be solely
responsible for routine maintenance and cleaning of the lateral from the clean-
out to the connection of the lateral to the sewer main.
   (f)   Liability for Property Damage. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted in any way to make the City or any of its officials,
representatives or employees liable for damage to private property, the
structures thereon or the contents thereof resulting from a back-up of waste
water or materials attributable in whole or in part to damage to blockage of
any portion of a lateral.
   (g)   Development of Forms and Policies. The Safety/Service Director shall
develop standardized forms and written policies for use in documenting the
steps for all claims and requests submitted under this section.
   (h)   Effective Date. The section shall apply only in cases where the
initial damage to the lateral was first identified after the effective date of
this section.

effluent cannot meet the requirements of federal, state or other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (e)    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof, and which, in the
judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
      (1)    Reject the wastes;
      (2)    Require pretreatment in accordance with the provisions of Appendix
A: High Strength Wastewater Discharges of this Chapter
912 to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;

   (h)    When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times to
the City.
   (i)    The Superintendent may evaluate whether a nondomestic user needs an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The Superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Superintendent may
develop such a plan for any user.
   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (j)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
   (k)    No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment
therefor, by the industrial concern and in accordance with the Wastewater
Surcharge Rates established in Chapter
913. (Ord. 10-53. Passed 10-25-10.)

   916.01 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this chapter is to comply with all of the applicable
requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) General Permit
for authorization for stormwater discharges associated with construction
activity (under the national pollutant discharge elimination system) No.
OHC000006, or the most recently approved National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Storm Water Discharge from Small
and Large Construction Activities, by establishing standards to achieve a level
of soil erosion and storm water control that will minimize and abate
degradation of land and water resources and damage to public and private
property resulting from earth-disturbing activities involving one acre or more.
Reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity disturbing less
than one acre must be considered if that construction activity is part of a
larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more.
Sites that involve less than 1 acre shall also comply with the minimum standard
practices to preclude sediment and erosion control including preparing a plan
that includes temporary best management practices and pollution prevention. In
addition, this chapter further intends to:
   (a)   Assure that State of Ohio Permits and requirements are in place and
met per NPDES for Storm Water Discharge from Small and Large Construction
Activities specifically for those involved in earth-disturbing activities
minimize both soil erosion and the volume and rate of storm water runoff from
their sites.
   (b)    Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all storm water management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained. Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP) shall be provided to the City for review as
required. SWPPP shall be prepared in accordance with the Ohio EPA permit
requirements and in accordance to the checklist located online here: https
https: epa.ohio.gov/divisions-and-offices/furface-water/guides-manuals/storm-
water-pollution-prevntion-plan-swp3-checklist-oh000005-
   (c)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
promptly revegetate and stabilize the site following earth-disturbing
activities.
   (d)    Encourage the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (Ord. 23-33. Passed 8-28-23.)
   916.02 SCOPE.
   (a)    Any person or persons proposing to disturb one acre or more of land
for residential, institutional, commercial, office and industrial purposes,
including land development proposals for non-agricultural uses and public
infrastructure uses, including transportation and utilities within the City
shall design, develop, and submit a Site Development Plan as described in
Section
916.06. Said plan will be evaluated to determine the potential for erosion,
runoff, and sedimentation impacts that may result from such development
activities.
   (b)    A Storm Water Management (SWM) plan shall be prepared as described in
Section
916.07 to minimize the impacts of increased impervious surfaces.
   (c)    No earth-disturbing activity subject to regulation under this chapter
shall be undertaken for any land disturbance equal to or greater than one acre
without an approved Site Development Plan as required under Section
916.06 and a Storm Water Management (SWM) Plan as required under Section
916.07.
   (d)    Final approval of a proposed development, redevelopment, street or
utility project shall not be given unless:
      (1)    A determination is made by the City Engineer based on submission
of a Site Development Plan as detailed in Section
916.06 that the proposed earth- disturbing activity will minimize accelerated
runoff, erosion, and/or sediment.
      (2)    A SWM plan has been approved by the City Engineer that determines
that the proposed earth-disturbing activity will not cause accelerated runoff,
erosion, and/or sediment.
   (e)    Any person or persons seeking approval to construct a structure shall
be exempted from having to prepare a Site Development Plan and a SWM plan
provided they meet all of the following:
      (1)    Construction takes place on one parcel.
      (2)    The earth-disturbing activity does not affect more than one acre
of the development site at a time.
      (3)    The activity is not located within a floodplain or floodway as
identified by FEMA.
      (4)    The parcel is part of an overall development plan which has
received approval of a SWM plan and the developer certifies that they will
comply with said plan.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-309 of the Ohio

imposed or required by other City provisions of law, ordinance, contract or
deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)    If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of this chapter invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)    These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate such
nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the owner from
the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall
not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being responsible
for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.

a storm of a given duration and intensity can be expected to be equaled or
exceeded.
   (pp)    "Structural controls." Any human-made facility, structure, or device
that is constructed to provide temporary storage and/or treatment of storm
water runoff. Examples include retention and detention basins, rock check dams,
swales, and constructed wetlands.
   (qq)    "Surface waters of the state" or "water bodies": means all streams,
lakes, reservoirs, ponds, marshes, wetlands or other waterways which are
situated wholly or partially within the boundaries of the state, except those
private waters which do not combine or effect a junction with natural surface
or underground waters. Waters defined as sewerage systems, treatment works, or
disposal systems in Ohio RC Section 6111.01 are not included.
   (rr)    "Total Maximum Daily Load." The sum of the existing and/or projected
point source, nonpoint source, and background loads for a pollutant to a
specified watershed, water body, or water body segment. A TMDL sets and
allocates the maximum amount of a pollutant that may be introduced into the
water and still ensures attainment and maintenance of water quality standards.
   (ss)    "Swale." A low-lying stretch of vegetated land which gathers and
carries surface water.
   (tt)    "Temporary vegetation." Short term vegetative cover such as oats,
rye, or wheat, used to stabilize the soil surface until final grading and
installation of permanent vegetation.

Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (c)   Dewatering. Discharges from dewatering activities, including
discharges from dewatering of trenches and excavations, are prohibited unless
managed by appropriate controls.
   (d)   Pollution Prevention Measures. Design, install, implement and maintain
effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the discharge of
pollutants. At a minimum, such measures must be designed, installed,
implemented and maintained to:
      (1)   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and vehicle
washing, wheel washwater, and other washwaters. Washwaters shall be treated in
a sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent or better
treatment prior to discharge;
      (2)   Minimize the exposure of construction materials, products, and
wastes; landscape materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides;
detergents, sanitary waste and other materials present on the site to
precipitation and to stormwater; and
      (3)   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and
implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures.
   (e)   Prohibited Discharges. The following discharges are prohibited:
      (1)   Wastewater from washout of concrete, unless managed by an
appropriate control;
      (2)   Wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form release
oils, curing compounds and other construction materials;
      (3)   Fuels, oils, or other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment
operation and maintenance; and
      (4)   Soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing or all
other wastewater streams which could be subject to an individual NPDES permit
(Part III.G.2.g).
   (f)   Surface Outlets. When discharging from sediment basins utilize outlet
structures that withdraw water from the surface, unless infeasible. (Note: Ohio
EPA believes that the circumstances in which it is infeasible to design outlet
structures in this manner are rare. Exceptions may include time periods with
extended cold weather during winter months. If you have determined that it is
infeasible to meet this requirement, you shall provide documentation in your
SWP3 to support your determination.)
   (g)   Post-Construction Stormwater Management Controls. So that receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected, and
stream functions are maintained, post-construction storm water practices shall
provide long-term management of runoff quality and quantity.
PART II. STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWP3)
   (a)   Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans. A SWP3 shall be developed for
each site covered by this permit. For a multi-phase construction project, a
separate NOI shall be submitted when a separate SWP3 will be prepared for
subsequent phases. SWP3s shall be prepared in accordance with sound engineering
and/or conservation practices by a professional experienced in the design and
implementation of standard erosion and sediment controls and
stormwater management practices addressing all phases of construction. The SWP3
shall clearly identify all activities which are required to be authorized under
Section 401 and subject to an antidegradation review. The SWP3 shall identify
potential sources of pollution which may reasonably be expected to affect the
quality of stormwater discharges associated with construction activities. The
SWP3 shall be a comprehensive, stand-alone document, which is not complete
unless it contains the information required by Part III.G of this permit. In
addition, the SWP3 shall describe and ensure the implementation of best
management practices (BMPs) that reduce the pollutants and impact of stormwater
discharges during construction and pollutants associated with the post-
construction land use to ensure compliance with ORC Section 6111.04, OAC
Chapter 3745-1 and the terms and conditions of this permit.
   (b)   Timing. An acceptable SWP3 shall be completed and submitted to the
applicable regulated MS4 entity (for projects constructed entirely within a
regulated MS4 area) prior to the timely submittal of an NOI. The SWP3 shall be
updated in accordance with Part III.D. Submission of a SWP3 does not constitute
review and approval on the part of Ohio EPA. Upon request and good cause shown,
the director may waive the requirement to have a SWP3 completed at the time of
NOI submission. If a waiver has been granted, the SWP3 must be completed prior
to the initiation of construction activities. The SWP3 must be implemented upon
initiation of construction activities.
   In order to continue coverage from the previous generations of this permit,
the permittee shall review and update the SWP3 to ensure that this permit's
requirements are addressed within 180 days after the effective date of this
permit. If it is infeasible for you to comply with a specific requirement in
this permit because (1) the provision was not part of the permit you were
previously covered under, and (2) because you are prevented from compliance due
to the nature or location of earth disturbances that commenced prior to the
effective date of this permit, you shall include documentation within your SWP3
of the reasons why it is infeasible for you to meet the specific requirement.
   Examples of OHC000006 permit conditions that would be infeasible for
permittees renewing coverage to comply with include:
   • OHC000006 post-construction requirements, for projects that obtained NPDES
construction stormwater coverage and started construction activities prior to
the effective date of this permit;
   • OHC000006 post-construction requirements, for multi-phase development
projects with an existing regional post-construction BMP issued under previous
NPDES post-construction requirements. This only applies to construction sites
authorized under Ohio EPA's Construction Stormwater Permits issued after April
20, 2003; or
   • Case-by-case situations approved by the Director.
   (c)   SWP3 Signature and Review.
      (1)   Plan Signature and Retention On-Site. The SWP3 shall include the
certification in Part V.H, be signed in accordance with Part V.G., and be
retained on site during working hours.
      (2)   Plan Availability.
         A.   On-site: The plan shall be made available immediately upon
request of the director or his authorized representative and MS4 operators or
their authorized representative during working hours. A copy of the NOI and
letter granting permit coverage under this general permit also shall be made
available at the site. The NOI and letter granting permit coverage may be
maintained electronically under the condition that they can be immediately
produced on-site upon request. The SWP3 may be prepared, signed, and kept
electronically, rather than in paper form, if the records are: (a) in a format
that can be read in a similar manner as a paper record; (b) legally dependable
with no less evidentiary value than their paper equivalent; and (c) immediately
accessible to the inspector during an inspection to the same extent as a paper
copy stored at the site would be, if the records were stored in paper form. For
additional guidance on the proper practices to follow for the electronic
retention of inspection report records, refer to this general permit's Fact
Sheet at https://epa.ohio.gov/divisions-and-offices/surfacewater/permitting/
storm-water-discharges-from-small-and-large-construction-activities--general-
permit.
         B.   By written request: The permittee must provide the most recent
copy of the SWP3 within 7 days upon written request by any of the following:
            i.    The City/director or the City/director's authorized
representative;
            ii.    A local agency approving sediment and erosion plans, grading
plans or stormwater management plans; or
            iii.    In the case of a stormwater discharge associated with
construction activity which discharges through a municipal separate storm sewer
system with an NPDES permit, to the operator of the system.
         C.   To the public: All NOIs, general permit approval for coverage
letters, and SWP3s are considered reports that shall be available to the public
in accordance with the Ohio Public Records law. The permittee shall make
documents available to the public upon request or provide a copy at public
expense, at cost, in a timely manner. However, the permittee may claim to Ohio
EPA any portion of an SWP3 as confidential in accordance with Ohio law.
      (3)   Plan Revision. The director or authorized representative may notify
the permittee at any time that the SWP3 does not meet one or more of the
minimum requirements of this part. Within 10 days after such notification from
the director or authorized representative (or as otherwise provided in the
notification), the permittee shall make the required changes to the SWP3 and
shall submit to Ohio EPA the revised SWP3 or a written certification that the
requested changes have been made.
   (d)   Amendments. The permittee shall amend the SWP3 whenever there is a
change in design, construction, operation or maintenance, which has a
significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to surface
waters of the state or if the SWP3 proves to be ineffective in achieving the
general objectives of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges
associated with construction activity. Amendments to the SWP3 may be reviewed
by Ohio EPA in the same manner as Part III.C.
   (e)   Duty to inform contractors and subcontractors. The permittee shall
inform all contractors and subcontractors not otherwise defined as "operators"
in Part VII of this general permit who will be involved in the implementation
of the SWP3 of the terms and conditions of this general permit. The permittee
shall maintain a written document containing the signatures of all contractors
and subcontractors involved in the implementation of the SWP3 as proof
acknowledging that they reviewed and understand the conditions and
responsibilities of the SWP3. For contractors and subcontractors which do not
meet the definition of an operator, the written document shall be created, and
signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of each contractors/
subcontractor's work.
   (f)   Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) allocations. If a TMDL is approved for
any waterbody into which the permittee's site discharges and requires specific
BMPs for construction sites, the director may require the permittee to revise
his/her SWP3. Specific conditions have been provided in Appendix A (for the Big
Darby Creek Watershed) and Appendix B (for portions of the Olentangy river
watershed).
   (g)   SWP3 Requirements. Operations that discharge stormwater from
construction activities are subject to the following requirements and the SWP3
shall include the following items:
      (1)   Site description. Each SWP3 shall provide:
         A.   A description of the nature and type of the construction activity
(e.g., low density residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.);
         B.   Total area of the site and the area of the site that is expected
to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavation, filling or grading,
including off-site borrow areas);
         C.   A measure of the impervious area and percent imperviousness
created by the construction activity (existing, new and total impervious area
after construction);
         D.   Stormwater calculations, including the volumetric runoff
coefficients for both the pre-construction and post- construction site
conditions, and resulting water quality volume; design details for post-
construction stormwater facilities and pretreatment practices such as
contributing drainage areas, capacities, elevations, outlet details and drain
times shall be included in the SWP3; and if applicable, explanation of the use
of existing post-construction facilities. Ohio EPA recommends the use of data
sheets ( see Ohio's Rainwater and Land Development manual and Ohio EPA
resources for examples);
         E.   Existing data describing the soil and, if available, the quality
of any discharge from the site;
         F.   A description of prior land uses at the site;
         G.   A description of the condition of any on-site streams ( e.g.,
prior channelization, bed instability or headcuts, channels on public
maintenance, or natural channels);
         H.   A BMP implementation schedule which describes the sequence of
major construction operations (i.e., designation of vegetative preservation
areas, grubbing, excavating, grading, utilities, infrastructure installation
and others) and the implementation of erosion, sediment and storm water
management practices or facilities to be employed during each operation of the
sequence;
         I.   The name and/or location of the immediate receiving stream or
surface water(s) and the first subsequent named receiving water(s) and the
areal extent and description of wetlands or other special aquatic sites at or
near the site which will be disturbed, or which will receive discharges from
disturbed areas of the project. For discharges to an MS4, the point of
discharge to the MS4 and the location where the MS4 ultimately discharges to a
stream or surface water of the state shall be indicated;
         J.   For subdivided developments, a detail drawing of individual
parcels with their erosion, sediment or stormwater control practices and/or a
typical individual lot showing standard individual lot erosion and sediment
control practices.
            A typical individual lot drawing does not remove the responsibility
to designate specific erosion and sediment control practices in the SWP3 for
critical areas such as steep slopes, stream banks, drainage ways and riparian
zones;
         K.   Location and description of any stormwater discharges associated
with dedicated asphalt and dedicated concrete plants covered by this permit and
the best management practices to address pollutants in these stormwater
discharges;
         L.   A cover page or title identifying the name and location of the
site, the name and contact information of all construction site operators, the
name and contact information for the person responsible for authorizing and
amending the SWP3, preparation date, and the estimated dates that construction
will start and be complete;
         M.   A log documenting grading and stabilization activities as well as
amendments to the SWP3, which occur after construction activities commence; and
         N.   Site map showing:
            i.    Limits of earth-disturbing activity of the site including
associated off-site borrow or spoil areas that are not addressed by a separate
NOI and associated SWP3;
            ii.    Soils types for all areas of the site, including locations
of unstable or highly erodible and/or known contaminated soils;
            iii.    Existing and proposed contours. A delineation of drainage
watersheds expected during and after major grading activities as well as the
size of each drainage watershed, in acres;
            iv.    The location of any delineated boundary for required
riparian setbacks;
            v.    Conservation easements or areas designated as open space,

            vi.    Surface water locations including springs, wetlands,
streams, lakes, water wells, etc., on or within 200 feet of the site, including
the boundaries of wetlands or stream channels and first subsequent named
receiving water(s) the permittee intends to fill or relocate for which the
permittee is seeking approval from the Army Corps of Engineers and/or Ohio EPA;
            vii.    Existing and planned locations of buildings, roads, parking
facilities and utilities;
            viii.    The location of all erosion and sediment control
practices, including the location of areas likely to require temporary
stabilization during site development;
            ix.    Sediment traps and basins noting their sediment storage and
dewatering ( detention) volume and contributing drainage area. Ohio EPA
recommends the use of data sheets (see Ohio EPA's Rainwater and Land
Development manual and website for examples) to provide data for all sediment
traps and basins noting important inputs to design and resulting parameters
such as their contributing drainage area, disturbed area, detention volume,
sediment storage volume, practice surface area, dewatering time, outlet type
and dimensions;
            x.    The location of permanent stormwater management practices
(new and existing) including pretreatment practices to be used to control
pollutants in stormwater after construction operations have been completed
along with the location of existing and planned drainage features including
catch basins, culverts, ditches, swales, surface inlets and outlet structures;
            xi.    Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid,
sanitary, and toxic wastes, including dumpster areas, areas designated for
cement truck washout, and vehicle fueling;
            xii.    The location of designated construction entrances where the
vehicles will access the construction site; and
            xiii.    The location of any areas of proposed floodplain fill,
floodplain excavation, stream restoration or known temporary or permanent
stream crossings.
      (2)   Controls. In accordance with Part II.A, the SWP3 shall contain a
description of the controls appropriate for each construction operation covered
by this permit and the operator(s) shall implement such controls. The SWP3
shall clearly describe for each major construction activity identified in Part
III.G.1.h: (a) appropriate control measures and the general timing (or
sequence) during the construction process that the measures will be
implemented; and (b) which contractor is responsible for implementation (e.g.,
contractor A will clear land and install perimeter controls and contractor B
will maintain perimeter controls until final stabilization). The SWP3 shall
identify the subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater
runoff. The SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified
subcontractors indicating that they have been informed and understand their
roles and responsibilities in complying with the SWP3. Ohio EPA recommends that
the primary site operator review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior to
commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review has occurred. Ohio EPA recommends that the
erosion, sediment, and stormwater management practices used to satisfy the
conditions of this permit should meet the standards and specifications in the
most current edition of Ohio's Rainwater and Land Development (see definitions)
manual or other standards acceptable to Ohio EPA. The controls shall include
the following minimum components:
         A.   Preservation Methods. The SWP3 shall make use of practices which
preserve the existing natural condition as much as feasible. Such practices may
include preserving existing vegetation, vegetative buffer strips, and existing
soil profile and topsoil; phasing of construction operations to minimize the
amount of disturbed land at any one time; and designation of tree preservation
areas or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. For all construction
activities immediately adjacent to surface waters of the state, the permittee
shall comply with the buffer non-numeric effluent limitation in Part II.A.6, as
measured from the ordinary high-water mark of the surface water. Ohio EPA
strongly recommends that 50-foot buffers be maintained around surface waters,
including wetlands.
         B.   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 shall make use of erosion
controls that provide cover over disturbed soils unless an exception is
approved in accordance with Part III.G.4. A description of control practices
designed to re-establish vegetation or suitable cover on disturbed areas after
grading shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 shall provide specifications
for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide guidance as to
which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of the year. Such
practices may include temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, matting,
sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations, use of construction entrances and the use of alternative ground
cover.
            i.    Stabilization. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized in
accordance with Table I (Permanent Stabilization) and Table 2 (Temporary
Stabilization) in Part 11.B of this permit.
            ii.    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Operators
shall undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding ( as defined in
the most current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual),
mulching, erosion control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with
bioengineering techniques or rock check dams.
         C.   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures
which control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion
from occurring. Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains,
diversions to direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading
practices. These practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and
steep slopes where practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
         D.   Sediment Control Practices. The plan shall include a description
of structural practices that shall store runoff allowing sediments to settle
and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from
exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, sediment barriers, earth
diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond and
storm drain inlet protection. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless those are
used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
            The SWP3 shall contain detail drawings for all structural
practices.
            i.    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional
throughout the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and
perimeter sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until
the upslope development area is stabilized with permanent cover. As
construction progresses and the topography is altered, appropriate controls
shall be constructed, or existing controls altered to address the changing
drainage patterns.
            ii.    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond is
required for any one of the following conditions:
               • Concentrated or collected stormwater runoff ( e.g., storm
sewer or ditch);
               • Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity
of silt fence or other sediment barriers; or
               • Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of
inlet protection.
            The permittee may request approval from Ohio EPA to use alternative
controls if the permittee can demonstrate the alternative controls are
equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
            (as defined in the most current edition of the Rainwater and Land
Development manual), mulching, erosion control matting, sodding, riprap,
natural channel design with bioengineering techniques or rock check dams.
            The permittee may request approval from Ohio EPA to use alternative
controls if the permittee can demonstrate the alternative controls are
equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
Table 3 Sediment Barrier Maximum Drainage Area Based on Slope
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of sediment barrier         drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   >20% but < 50%
            Placing sediment barriers in a parallel series does not extend the
size of the drainage area. Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep
runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where practicable. Diversion
practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff
from areas up to 10 acres.
            iv.    Inlet Protection. Other erosion and sediment control
practices shall minimize sediment laden water entering active storm drain
systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more acres
will require a sediment settling pond.
            v.    Surface Waters of the State Protection. If construction
activities disturb areas adjacent to surface waters of the state, structural
practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect all adjacent
surface waters of the state from the impacts of sediment runoff. No structural
sediment controls ( e.g., the installation of silt fence or a sediment settling
pond) shall be used in a surface water of the state. For all construction
activities immediately adjacent to surface waters of the state, the permittee
shall comply with the buffer non-numeric effluent limitation in Part II.A.6, as
measured from the ordinary high water mark of the surface water. Where impacts
within this buffer area are unavoidable, due to the nature of the construction
(e.g., stream crossings for roads or utilities), the project shall be designed
such that the number of stream crossings and the width of the disturbance
within the buffer area are minimized.
            vi.    Modifying Controls. If periodic inspections or other
information indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly,
the permittee shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
         E.   Post-Construction Stormwater Management Requirements. So that
receiving stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are
protected, and stream functions are maintained, postconstruction stormwater
practices shall provide long-term management of runoff quality and quantity. To
meet the post-construction requirements of this permit, the SWP3 shall contain
a description of the post-construction BMPs that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
shall address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality. Post-construction BMPs cannot be installed within
the surface water of the state ( e.g., wetland or stream) unless it is
authorized by a CWA 401 water quality certification, CWA 404 permit, or Ohio
EPA non-jurisdictional wetland/stream program approval. Note: local
jurisdictions may have more stringent post-construction requirements.
            i.    Operation and Maintenance Plans. Detail drawings and
maintenance plans shall be provided for all post-construction BMPs in the SWP3.
Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to the postconstruction
operator of the site (including homeowner associations) upon completion of
construction activities (prior to termination of permit coverage). Maintenance
plans shall ensure that pollutants collected within structural post-
construction practices are disposed of in accordance with local, state, and
federal regulations. To ensure that stormwater management systems function as
designed and constructed, the post-construction operation and maintenance plan
shall be stand-alone document which contains:
               1)    a designated entity for storm water inspection and
maintenance responsibilities;
               2)    the routine and non-routine maintenance tasks to be
undertaken;
               3)    a schedule for inspection and maintenance;
               4)    any necessary legally binding maintenance easements and
agreements;
               5)    construction drawings or excerpts showing the plan view,
profile and details of the outlet(s);
               6)    a map showing all access and maintenance easements; and
               7)    for table 4a/4b practices, provide relevant elevations and
associated volumes that dictate when removal of accumulated sediments must
occur.
               Permittees are responsible for assuring all post-construction
practices meet plan specifications and intended post-construction conditions
have been met (e.g., sediment removed from, and sediment storage restored to,
permanent pools, sediment control outlets removed and replaced with permanent
postconstruction discharge structures, and all slopes and drainageways
permanently stabilized), but are not responsible under this permit for
operation and maintenance of post-construction practices once coverage under
this permit is terminated.
            ii.    Point Source Dischargers. Post-construction stormwater BMPs
that discharge pollutants from point sources once construction is completed may
in themselves need authorization under a separate NPDES permit (one example is
stormwater discharges from regulated industrial sites).
            iii.    No Impervious Surface. Construction activities that do not
include the installation of any impervious surface (e.g., park lands),
abandoned mine land reclamation activities regulated by the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, stream and wetland restoration activities, and wetland
mitigation activities are not required to comply with the conditions of Part
III.G.2.e of this permit. Linear construction projects (e.g., pipeline or
utility line installation) which do not result in the installation of
additional impervious surface are not required to comply with the conditions of
Part 111.G.2.e of this permit. However, linear construction projects shall be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance, and to achieve final stabilization of the disturbed area as
defined in Part VII.M.l .
            iv.    Post-Construction BMPs. For all construction activities that
will disturb two or more acres of land or will disturb less than two acres that
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb two
or more acres of land, the post construction BMP(s) chosen shall be able to
manage storm water runoff for protection of stream channels, stream stability,
and water quality. The BMP(s) chosen must be compatible with site and soil
conditions. Structural post-construction stormwater treatment practices shall
be incorporated into the permanent drainage system for the site. The BMP(s)
chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure
compliance with Ohio's Water Quality Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv
shall be equivalent to the volume of runoff from a 0.90-inch rainfall and shall
be determined using the following equations:
               WQv = Rv * P *A/ 12 (Equation 1)
               where:
               WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
               Rv = the volumetric runoff coefficient calculated using equation
2
               P = 0.90 inch precipitation depth
               A = area draining into the BMP in acres
               Rv = 0.05 + 0.9i (Equation 2)
               where i = fraction of post-construction impervious surface Ohio
EPA recommends BMPs be designed according to the methodology described in the
most current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual or in another
design manual acceptable for use by Ohio EPA and in accordance with ORC Chapter
4733. The BMPs listed in Tables 4a and 4b below are considered standard BMPs
approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may limit
the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time
is long enough to provide treatment but short enough to provide storage for
successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions. The
outlet structure for the post-construction BMP shall not discharge more than
the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the minimum drain time
listed in Table 4a. The WQv is the volume of stormwater runoff that must be
detained by a post-construction practice as specified by the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual. Post-construction
practices shall be sized to treat 100% of the WQv associated with their
contributing drainage area. If there is an existing post-construction BMP that
treats runoff from the disturbed area and the BMP meets the post-construction
requirements of this permit, no additional post-construction BMP will be
required. A regional stormwater BMP may be used to meet the post-construction
requirement if: (1) the BMP meets the design requirements for treating the WQv;
and (2) a legal agreement is established through which the regional BMP owner
or operator agrees to provide this service in the long term. Design information
for such facilities such as contributing drainage areas, capacities,
elevations, outlet details and drain times shall be included in the SWP3.

Notes:
1.    The outlet structure shall not discharge more than the first half of the
WQv in less than one-third of the minimum drain time.
2.    Provide a permanent pool with a minimum volume equal to the WQv and an
extended detention volume above the permanent pool equal to the WQv.
3.    An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be incorporated
into the BMP for sediment storage.
4.    Dry extended detention basins must include a forebay and a micropool each
sized at a minimum of 0.1 x WQv and a protected outlet, or include acceptable
pretreatment and a protected outlet.
5.    Underground storage must have pretreatment for removal of suspended
sediments included in the design and documented in the SWP3. This pretreatment
shall concentrate sediment in a location where it can be readily removed. For
non-infiltrating, underground extended detention systems, pretreatment shall be
at least 50% effective at capturing total suspended solids according to the
testing protocol established in the Alternative Post Construction BMP Testing
Protocol.
6.    The WQv ponding area shall be completely empty between 24 and 72 hours.

Permeable Pavement - Infiltration 3               48 hours
Underground Storage Facility - Infiltration 3,4,5 48 hours
Notes:
1.    Bioretention soil media shall have a permeability of approximately 1 - 5
in/hr. Meeting the soil media specifications in the Rainwater and Land
Development manual is considered compliant with this requirement. Bioretention
cells must have underdrains unless in-situ conditions allow for the WQv
(surface ponding) plus the bioretention soil (to a depth of 24 inches) to drain
completely within 48 hours.
2.    Infiltrating practices with the WQv stored aboveground (bioretention,
infiltration basin) shall fully drain the WQv within 24 hours to minimize
nuisance effects of standing water and to promote vigorous communities of
appropriate vegetation.
3.    The SWP3 shall demonstrate the design infiltration rate values are
derived from site-specific measurements obtained through field tests of the in-
situ soil for practices designed to infiltrate the WQv.
4.    Subsurface practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv (infiltration
trench, permeable pavement with infiltration, underground storage with
infiltration) shall empty within 48 hours to recover storage for subsequent
storm events.
5.    Underground storage systems with infiltration must have adequate
pretreatment of suspended sediments included in the design and documented in
the SWP3 in order to minimize clogging of the infiltrating surface.
Pretreatment shall concentrate sediment in a location where it can be readily
removed. Examples include media filters situated upstream of the storage or
other suitable alternative approved by Ohio EPA. For infiltrating underground
systems, pretreatment shall be at least 80% effective at capturing total
suspended solids according to the testing protocol established in the
Alternative Post-Construction BMP Testing Protocol.

construction and post construction site conditions.
         B.    Storm Water Quality Control:
            1.    Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following storm water management practices. These
practices are listed in Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to
meet the following general performance standards:
               a.    Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm
water runoff; filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water; promote
infiltration and evapotranspiration of storm water; and discharge the
controlled runoff to a water resource.
               b.    Extended detention facilities that detain storm water;
settle or filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled storm water
to a water resource.
               c.    Infiltration facilities that retain storm water; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
storm water into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering
report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
               d.    For sites less than five (5) acres, but greater than one
(1) acre and not part of a common plan of development, where (1) or more acres
are disturbed, the City Engineer may approve other BMPs if the applicant
demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these BMPs meet the
objectives of this regulation.
               e.    For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five

shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:
         A.    The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the site does not exceed the peak rate of runoff
from a one-year frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the same site under pre-
development conditions.
         B.    Storms of less frequent occurrence than the critical storm, up
to the one hundred (100) year storm shall have the proposed peak runoff rates
reduced to their respective existing condition peak runoff rates.
      (3)    Calculation of a critical storm for each subdrainage unit of the
site shall be determined as follows:
         A.    Calculate by appropriate hydrologic methods, such as the TR55,
the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency, 24-hour storm occurring
on the development area before and after development.
         B.    From the volumes determined in (4) A. above, determine the

protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.

notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years. (Ord. 11-34. Passed 7-25-11.)

subdivision before obtaining from the City Planning Commission and Council the
approval of the preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision.
   (a)    Preliminary Plan.
      (1)    General. The subdivider shall have prepared a preliminary plan,
together with the plans and such preliminary plans and specifications of
improvements as required by these Regulations as specified in Chapter
1111.
      (2)    Filing. Four copies of the preliminary plan and supplementary
material specified, shall be submitted to the Commission with written
application for approval.
      (3)    Approval. The Commission, acting through the designated official,
shall, within forty-five days of having been submitted to the designated
official, or Mayor, or within such further time as the applicant may agree to,
review the preliminary plan and other material submitted for conformity thereof
to these Regulations and negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed
advisable. The Commission shall inform the subdivider as to which public
offices shall be contacted by him to determine the nature and extent of the
improvements required.
         A.    Upon completion of the review, the action of the Commission
shall be forwarded to Council for their approval of the proposed subdivision
and its extension and connection to existing utility lines.
         B.    Approval of the preliminary plan shall not constitute approval
of the subdivision plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of the
approval to the layout as returned to the subdivider on the preliminary plan,
as a guide to the preparation of the subdivision plat which will be submitted
for approval of the Commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the
requirements of these Regulations.
         C.    If the Commission does not render a decision on the preliminary
plan within the forty-five days stipulated in subsection (a)(3) hereof or such
further time as they may agree to, nothing in these Regulations shall prohibit
the subdivider from taking his plans directly to Council for approval.
         D.    Approval of the preliminary plan shall expire in one year unless
a plat has been filed with the Commission for approval.
   (b)    Subdivision Plat; Final Plan.
      (1)    General. The subdivision plat shall conform to the preliminary
plan except where changes are agreed upon between the City and the subdivider
and it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plan which
the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such
portion conforms with all the requirements of these Regulations.
      (2)    Submission of plans. After receiving notice of approval of the
preliminary plan, if the subdivider desires to proceed, the subdivider shall
proceed to file with the Planning Commission:
         A.    The original tracing plus two copies of the subdivision plat as
required under Section
1111.02.
         B.    A subdivider's agreement, deeds, easements, as required and a
performance bond when subdivider plans to record plat prior to installation and
acceptance of improvements; and
         C.    A written application for approval upon compliance with the
formal provisions of these Regulations indicating his intentions to proceed by
either depositing with the City the required performance bond and recording the
subdivision plat at the County Recorder's office or complete the installation
of all subdivision improvements and obtain Council's acceptance by ordinance of
these improvements prior to the recording of the plat, without depositing a
performance bond.
         D.    The subdivider shall submit to the City Engineer for his review
and approval all construction drawings required related to the improvements to
be constructed in the subdivision as required by these Regulations.
Construction of these improvements may begin as soon as the City Engineer has
stated his approval of drawings and the preliminary plan has been approved by
the Commission and Council.
         E.    The Planning Commission shall forward their recommendations for
approval of the plat to Council.
         F.    If the Commission does not render a decision on the plat within
forty-five days of having been submitted to the Commission's designated
official, or Mayor or within such further time as the applicant may agree the
subdivider may take his plat directly to Council for approval.
         G.    The signed plat shall remain in the possession of the
Commission's designated official or Mayor until such time as a performance bond
has been received or all improvements have been installed and accepted by
Council, park land or donation has been accomplished, easements not on plat are
recorded and other required restrictions not on plat have been recorded, at
which time the City shall record the plat at the subdivider's expense.
      (3)    Building permit. No building permit shall be issued until the plat
has been approved and filed with the Recorder. Permits for construction, not
occupancy of model homes may be issued with approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
      (4)    Dedication for public use. If the final plat indicates land for
public use, the plat shall be submitted to Council for acceptance of any public
land and acceptance for any easement before it is recorded. The acceptance of
any street or utility for public use and maintenance shall be by separate
action of Council.

   1109.07  EASEMENTS.
   Public utility easements shall have a minimum width of twenty feet or such
additional width as may be required by necessary access to the utility
involved. Such easements shall be located along each rear and side lot and
shall state for the purpose of construction and maintaining a storm water
drainage system as stated in the water management and sediment and erosion
control regulations. Where possible, the easement shall be located ten feet on
both adjoining properties. The City reserves the right to enter upon said
easement at any time but does not accept the responsibility of maintaining any
storm water drainage system located within the easement. A permit shall be
obtained from the Building Inspector to change or alter the established grade
as stated in the water management and sediment and erosion control ordinance.
An easement shall be recorded prior to the issuance of any building permits.
(Ord. 98-12. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1109.08 STREETS.
   (a)   General Provisions. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade
and location of all streets shall conform to the Official Thoroughfare Plan or
subsequent amendments thereof, and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public
convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets. As to arrangement, the subdivider
shall provide within the boundaries of the subdivision plat the necessary right
of way for the widening, continuance or alignment of such streets in conformity
with the Official Thoroughfare Plan by one of the following methods:
      (1)   The dedication of the necessary right of way for the continuation,
extension or connection of any present or planned thoroughfare.
      (2)   When subdividing the land fronting on an existing road or street,
not designated on the Official Thoroughfare Plan as equal to or of greater
importance than an auxiliary street, a reasonable provision shall be made for
necessary rights of way or easements for traffic, utilities and drainage.
   (b)   Major Traffic Arteries and Physical Barriers.
      (1)   Traffic arteries. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing
or proposed street of equal or greater width than a secondary thoroughfare as
shown on the Official Thoroughfare Plan, the Commission may require any of the
following:
         A.   Marginal access streets.
         B.   Reverse frontage with planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line or a planting strip of a minimum width
of twenty feet on the rear of the lots with no vehicular access across such
strip.
         C.   Deep lots with rear service alleys.
         D.   Such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
      (2)   Physical barriers. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right of way or limited access highway right of way, the Commission
may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right
of way at a distance suitable for necessary traffic circulation.
   (c)    Arrangement.
      (1)    Traffic. Minor streets as defined herein and on the Official
Thoroughfare Plan shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will
be discouraged.
      (2)    Access to adjacent property. The street layout shall make
provision for the proper projection and continuance of streets and all
utilities into adjacent unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and
desirable by the Commission. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall
be prohibiting.
      (3)    Future street system. Where the plat to be submitted includes only
part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require a sketch
of a tentative future street system for the unsubdivided portion.
   (d)    Alignment.
      (1)    Horizontal.
         A.    Jogs. No street layouts with center line offsets of less than
125 feet shall be permitted without consent of the Commission.
         B.    Angle of intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles and no street shall intersect
any other street at less than sixty degrees.
         C.    Intersection approaches. Approaches to street intersections
shall be straight for a distance of at least 100 feet from the center line of
the street intersected.
         D.    Reverse curves. A total tangent of at least 200 feet long shall
be introduced between reverse curves on all but minor and marginal access
streets.
      (2)    Vertical; grade at intersection. Approaches to intersections shall
be reduced to a grade not exceeding three percent for a distance of at least
150 feet. The Commission may modify this requirement when an unreasonable
hardship would result from its strict enforcement.
   (e)    Classification. The Commission approving each street in a proposed
subdivision shall be governed by the following standards:
      (1)    For main and secondary thoroughfares, the minimum radius or
curvature shall be 300 feet on the center lines; for minor streets, 100 feet
and for local service streets, seventy-five feet.
      (2)    All horizontal curves shall show the complete function of such
curves and each P.C. and P.T. shall be stationed.
      (3)    Profiles and grades of all proposed streets shall be the center
line grades of the respective streets and shall be indicated in complete detail
in the profiles and referenced to the stationing shown on the plan.
   The maximum grades shall not exceed seven percent for main and secondary
thoroughfares or fourteen percent for minor or local service streets. The
minimum grade for all classifications of streets shall not be less than four-
tenths of one percent. All major changes in grade shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equal to fifteen times the algebraic
difference in the rate of grade for thoroughfares, and one-half this minimum
length for minor local service streets.
The P.C. and P.T. of all vertical curves shall be stationed and elevations
shall be shown at least every twenty-five feet within the limits of the
vertical curves.
   (f)    Corner Radii at Intersections. Property lines at street right-of-way
intersections shall be rounded with a radius of twenty-five feet or of a
greater radius where the Commission may deem it necessary.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   (g)    Dead end Streets.
      (1)    Permanent. Dead end streets or cul-de-sacs, designed to be so
permanently, shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turn-around having a street property line diameter of at
least 100 feet. The street right-of-way lines and the 100-foot diameter
turnaround should be joined by tangent arcs of a fifty-foot minimum radius.
      (2)    Temporary.
         A.    Where streets are extended to the boundary of a subdivision to
provide for their proper continuance at such time as the adjacent land is
subdivided, they may be terminated within the right of way provided a temporary
concrete or black top "T" turn around is constructed at least twenty-two feet
wide the complete width of the right of way and located within the last thirty
feet of the street pavement.
         B.    If a street extends only one lot in depth past a street
intersection, no turn-around is required.
            (Ord. 89-16. Passed 3-13-89.)
   (h)    Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except under one of
the following conditions:
      (1)    There exists a half-street which should logically be continued to
a reasonable intersection.
      (2)    There exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the
tract to be subdivided; the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by
the Commission.
         (Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   1109.09 ALLEYS.
   (a)    Required. Alleys shall be provided in apartment, commercial and
industrial districts, except where other definite and assured provision is made
for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking
consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   (b)    Prohibited. Alleys shall be prohibited in one and two-family
districts, except where it is desirable to continue an existing alley to the
nearest intersection, or where the lots face a street shown on the Official
Thoroughfare Plan and provision has not or cannot be made for limited access on
such street.
   (c)    Width. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty feet.
   (d)    Intersection. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment
shall be avoided but, where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to
permit safe vehicular movement.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   1109.10 BLOCKS.
   (a)    Provisions. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to the following:
      (1)    Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated.
      (2)    Zoning requirements and the requirements contained in these
Regulations as to lot size and dimension.
      (3)    Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
      (4)    Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (b)    Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,800 feet in length except where
topographical conditions require longer blocks; and they shall not be less than
400 feet in length. Where blocks are longer than 1,800 feet, crosswalk
easements not less than twenty feet in width may be required near the center of
the block. The Commission may require that sidewalks be provided in the
crosswalk easement.
   (c)    Width. Blocks shall contain two rows of lots except where double and
reverse frontage lots are allowed.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
 
   1109.11 LOTS.
   (a)    General. The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation and the
minimum setback line shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision
and for the type of development and use contemplated in order to secure and
provide for the proper arrangement of streets or other highways in relation to
existing or planned streets or highways or to the City plan for adequate and
convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of fire fighting
apparatus, recreation, light, air and for the avoidance of congestion of
population. Lots shall meet all lawful requirements as adopted by the various
governmental subdivisions or public agencies having jurisdiction over this
problem.
   The Commission may limit to a maximum ratio of three and one-half to one the
depth to width of lots for the most efficient use of land. All lots shall
conform to the area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance of the City.
   (b)    Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width
where necessary to permit a required building setback from and orientation to
both streets.
   (c)    Ingress and Egress. The subdividing of land shall be such as to
provide each lot with frontage on a public street.
   (d)    Double and Reverse Frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage
lots may be allowed where they are essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least twenty feet and across which there would be no right of access, should be
provided along the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
   (e)    Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
or radial to street lines.
   (f)    Building Setback Lines. Building setback lines shall be in accordance
with those specified in the Zoning Ordinance of the City.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   1109.12 SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks shall be required in accordance with Chapter
1113 and
Appendix A of these Regulations. Sidewalks need not be installed prior to
acceptance of improvements by Council, provided an easement is recorded with
all lands in subdivision stating that sidewalks shall be installed in the right
of way fronting a sublot prior to occupancy of any building on such sublot, or
a cash deposit of one and one-half times the estimated cost to construct the
sidewalk is deposited with the City which money shall be used to construct the
sidewalk if the sidewalk is not constructed within six months after occupancy,
or the money shall be returned if the City does not construct such sidewalk.

   1113.01 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   After approval of the preliminary plan the following procedure shall be
followed:
   (a)    The engineer of the subdivision shall consult the City Engineer as to
the engineering details required for all improvements. Where the subdivision is
outside the City and within the three-mile limit of subdivision jurisdiction,
and the plans for the subdivision call for the installation of septic tanks for
sanitary disposal or for central sewage treatment facilities, an additional
print shall be sent to the County Board of Health or the County Sanitary
Engineer for report and approval.
   (b)    After the plan has been reviewed by the City Engineer and other
concerned agencies, and the design details and requirements have been
satisfactorily met, it shall be reported back by letter to the designated
official.
      (Ord. 87-18. Passed 3-9-87.)
   (c)    Before any construction is started on improvements the subdivider or
developer shall have executed a subdivider’s agreement with the City or any
other applicable City or County department, acting through the City designated
official. Before the subdivider’s agreement may be executed on behalf of the
City, it must first be approved by Council.

(Ord. 95-34. Passed 4-24-95.)
   1115.02 EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL FOR SEWERS AND WATER MAINS.
   These specifications for excavation and backfill are minimum requirements
and will cover most work in general. Special requirements for unusual
conditions shall be agreed upon at the time of submitting detail plans and
specifications.
   (a)    Trench Excavation. The trench excavation for both sewer and water
pipe bedding shall be true to line and grade, as shown on the plans. The banks
of the trench shall be kept as nearly vertical as possible and shall be
properly drained.
         The bottom of the trenches shall not be more than twenty-four inches
wider than the outside diameter of the pipe with a minimum clearance between
the bottom of the pipe and the trench bottom of one-fourth of the pipe
diameter, but not less than six inches, in order that the pipe may be bedded in
No. 6 stone or slag as described in backfill subsections (g), (h) or (i)
hereof. Shale, ledge rock, boulders and large stones shall be removed from the
trench to give a minimum clearance from pipe or fittings of six inches.
   (b)    Unstable Ground. Wherever wet, unstable or other undesirable soil is
encountered which does not provide proper bearing for piping, such material
shall be excavated to good ground and the excavation refilled with suitable
material to the required subgrade, compacting the fill in six-inch layers. If
it would be more economical and desirable, soft ground may be crossed by
supporting the pipe on concrete cradles, poured to cover the lower quadrant of
the pipe. In no case shall any pipe or appurtenances be laid in or on topsoil.
   (c)    Unauthorized Excavation. Wherever excavation in good ground has been
carried below the established grade for installation of the piping, such
excavated space shall be refilled with suitable material, as approved by the
City Engineer, to the required subgrade, compacting the fill in six-inch
layers.
   (d)    Sheeting, Shoring and Bracing. All excavation shall be adequately
protected from caving. If such caving occurs and disturbs the bedding, the
grade or the alignment of the piping, the work shall be removed, suitable
sheeting, shoring and bracing provided, and the work reinstalled. The sheeting
and bracing, in general, shall be removed as backfilling progresses and in such
a manner as to avoid caving of the trench. Voids left by the withdrawal of
sheeting shall be carefully filled and tamped.
   (e)    Excavation Under Railroad Tracks. Excavation under railroad tracks
shall be determined separately for each individual crossing and shall be shown
on the plans and described in the specifications.
   (f)    Tunnel Excavations. Where the excavation crosses main highways or
railroad tracks, tunneling may be permitted where depth of trench and soil
conditions are adequate. All tunnel backfill shall be of proper moisture
content to compact readily and shall be thoroughly tamped and rammed under,
around and over the pipe from the floor of the tunnel to the sidewalls and top
thereof. Where tunneling is to be used, the method and details shall be shown
in the plans and specifications.
   (g)    Backfill for Water Mains. After the piping has been laid to line and
grade, trenches shall be backfilled with No. 6 limestone, carefully deposited
under and on both     sides of the pipe, thoroughly and carefully rammed by
hand tamping methods until such fill has been brought to the center line of the
pipe. Then, fine, loose earth shall be placed and thoroughly and carefully
rammed by hand tamping methods until such fill has been brought to six inches
above the pipe. This portion of the backfill shall be carefully placed and
thoroughly compacted until a firm and continuous support on the bottom and
sides is secured. Where the trench is excavated through cinder fill or other
material which, in the opinion of the Inspector, is not suitable for backfill,
suitable material for backfilling shall be hauled to the site. The remainder of
the trench may then be backfilled by hand or mechanical equipment. Water
settling may be permitted if it is possible to do so without floating the pipe.
   (h)    Backfill for Sanitary Sewers. After sewer piping has been approved
for line and grade, the trenches shall be backfilled with No. 6 limestone or
slag, carefully deposited under and around the pipe and the backfill shall be
thoroughly and carefully rammed by hand tamping methods until enough limestone
or slag fill has been placed to provide a cover of at least six inches above
the top of the pipe. This backfill shall provide a firm and continuous support
on the bottom and sides of the pipe. The remainder of the backfill shall
consist of material previously excavated and may be placed by hand or
mechanical equipment. Water settling will be permitted, providing floating of
the pipe does not occur.
   (i)    Backfill for Storm Sewers. After sewer piping has been approved for
line and grade, trenches shall be backfilled with No. 6 limestone or slag,
carefully deposited under and around the pipe and the backfill shall be
thoroughly and carefully rammed by hand tamping methods until enough limestone
or slag fill has been placed to extend up around the pipe, a distance from the
bottom of the pipe shown in the minimum bedding depth table as follows:
 
Minimum Bedding Depth for Pipe

   (j)    Backfill in Paved Areas. Wherever trenches occur in existing roadways
and paved areas, the backfill shall consist of No. 6 stone. It shall be
thoroughly compacted in six-inch layers or puddled with a hose and long
nozzles, after the backfill is in place. When the area is to be paved with
asphalt, the top eight inches of the backfill shall consist of crushed slag or
limestone to match the road base and shall then be paved to match the existing
road or paved area. For all concrete pavement, the concrete must project at
least one foot beyond the trench sides.
         Wherever trenches occur in future paved areas, the backfill shall be
as per the foregoing paragraph or in accordance with subsections (g), (h) or
(i), hereof, if left unpaved for a period of at least six months after
completion of the backfill operation.

   The manhole steps shall be cast iron. The invert channels shall be smoothed
and accurately shaped to a semicircular bottom conforming to the inside of the
adjacent sewer section. Wherever possible, the inverts shall be constructed by
laying channel pipe through the manhole or sewer pipe and then breaking out the
upper half after the concrete base has been poured to the center line of the
pipe. Pipe shall not protrude into the manhole and shall be cut flush with the
inside face of the manhole.
   City Standards, Appendix A, shall be followed.
   Precast concrete manholes may be used if approved. Detail drawings will be
required for such approval.
   (c)    Pipe Laying. The bedding of No. 6 limestone or slag shall be placed
in such a manner as to assure full support along the lower quadrant of the pipe
barrel only and not in the bells. As the pipe is laid, each length shall be
checked for alignment and grade. Pipe laying shall proceed upgrade with spigot
ends pointing in the direction of flow.
   A defective pipe or pipe which has had its line or grade disturbed
sufficiently to open the joint after laying, shall be taken up and replaced.
All open ends in the pipe shall be stopped. Stoppers shall have the same joints
as the sewer pipe and shall be installed in wyes as the work progresses and in
the pipe line when the work is not in progress.
   Wye branches shall be installed for each property and a record of actual
locations shall be given to the Director of Public Service so that they may be
recorded. All wyes shall be closed with stoppers described above. In new
developments, branch lines from main line wyes for house sewers shall be
installed from the main to the sideline of the street right of way, at the time
of installing the main sewer.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   1115.05 STORM SEWERS.
   (a)    Pipe. The pipe shall be vitrified tile, plain concrete or reinforced
concrete, whichever the conditions of loading may require, and shall be so
stipulated by the drawings and specifications. The concrete pipe shall be of
the tongue and groove type.
   (b)    Manholes and Inlets. The manholes and inlets shall be constructed of
common hard clay or shale brick and laid up with a one to two cement mortar to
which may be added lime not to exceed twenty-five percent by volume of the
cement. The outside shall be plastered and troweled with one inch of waterproof
cement mortar. The inside shall be rubbed with a cloth in lieu of striking the
joints.
   All brick shall be thoroughly cleaned and saturated with water, immediately
before being placed.
   City Standards, Appendix A, shall be followed.
   Pipe shall not protrude into the manhole or inlet and shall be cut flush
with the inside of the manhole.
   (c)    Pipe Laying. The bedding of No. 6 limestone or slag shall be placed
in such a manner to assure full support along the lower quadrant of the pipe
barrel. As the pipe is laid, each length shall be checked for alignment and
grade. Pipe laying shall proceed upgrade with spigot ends pointing in the
direction of flow. A defective pipe or pipe which has had its line or grade
disturbed sufficiently to open the joint after laying, shall be taken up and
replaced. All open ends in the pipe shall be stopped and all joints shall be
waterproof.
(Ord. 69-35. Passed 10-27-69.)
   1115.06 TESTING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)    Sanitary Sewerage and Water Lines. Field tests shall be conducted
before the systems are placed in service, if deemed necessary by the City
Engineer. The tests shall be performed as specified herein, in the presence of
a representative of the Director of Public Service. Preliminary tests and
repair or correction of all faulty work shall be completed before calling the
representative to observe the test for acceptance.
   Disposal of testing media must be done with full consideration to flooding
or damage to the piping, other installation, adjoining property and the safety
of personnel.
      (1)    Testing equipment. All necessary apparatus and equipment required
for testing, including pumps, barrels, gauges, mirrors, temporary lines and
fittings, shall be furnished by the persons constructing the sanitary sewers,
water mains and/or appurtenances thereto.
      (2)    Water lines. The piping shall be tested hydrostatically and
permissible leakage shall be as specified in the AWWA Standard which is
evaluated for a pressure basis of 150 psi.
            Permissible leakage shall not be more than seventy-five U.S.
gallons per twenty-four hours per mile of pipe per inch of nominal diameter of
pipe.
            The City water piping shall be thoroughly sterilized with chlorine
and flushed before it is placed in operation. The chlorinating materials shall
be introduced to the City water piping under the direction of the Director of
Public Service. Following a contact with clean water until the residual
chlorine content is not greater than two-tenths ppm. Tests for efficacy of
sterilization shall be made by the developer and repeated sterilization shall
be performed by those installing the work as required.
      (3)    Sanitary sewerage. All sewers shall be constructed and so jointed
that infiltration of water into, or leakage of sewage therefrom, shall not be
greater than hereinafter specified when subjected to the following leakage
test:
            After sewers, or sections thereof, have been constructed and the
backfilling has been sufficiently completed to prevent flotation of the pipe,
and at times and locations selected by the Director of Public Service, sections
of the sewer shall be isolated and the test shall be made by plugging the
downgrade end of the section to be tested and a temporarily installed curve or
other fitting, shall be used at the other end so that the station to be tested
can be filled with water with four feet of head at the upper end for a period
of one hour. The four feet of head shall be measured above the crown of the
pipe, and in cases where the ground water table is higher than the sewer, the
four feet of head shall be measured above the water table.
            These isolated sections of sewer shall be from manhole to manhole
in order to test only the sewer pipe, and the maximum rate of exfiltration
shall be 400 gallons per inch of diameter of pipe per twenty-four hours per
mile of pipe.
            Manholes shall be plugged and tested separately. The maximum ground
water infiltration for a manhole four feet in diameter shall be 0.291 gallons
per vertical foot per hour.
            Before the leakage test, the sewer shall be subject to a test for
grade, line and cleanliness. The test shall consist of a visual inspection of
the sewer. Mirrors will be used to cast a beam of light into the sewer at each
manhole and the inspection will be made by sighting through the sewer from
manhole to manhole.
            All obstructions found in the sewer shall be removed and
irregularities in line and grade shall be straightened.
   (b)    Concrete Pavement. Compression test cylinders shall be made by the
inspector each day. If further tests are deemed necessary by the City Engineer,
he shall so direct that these be made in addition to the compression tests. If
the cylinders do not show the required compressive strength is attained,
borings of the pavement shall be required, and if these show the pavement to
have less than the required compressive strength, the pavement shall be removed
and replaced.

   1121.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or
structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be in a manner which does
not comply with all the district regulations established by this Zoning Code
for the district in which the building or land is located.
   The minimum yards and other spaces, including the density of population
provisions, contained in this Zoning Code for each and every building existing
on the effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 65-82, passed December 27,
1965) or building hereafter erected, or structurally altered, shall not be
encroached upon or considered as yard or open space requirements for any other
building.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall hinder the construction of a
building or prohibit its use where construction has started before the
effective date of this Zoning Code, (Ordinance 65-82, passed December 27, 1965)
provided that the foundation walls have been completed and the owner is
proceeding in good faith to complete the building within one year from the date
of the issuance of the permit therefor.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   1121.02 INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE AND CONFLICT.
   (a)    In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they
shall be held to be minimum requirements for the promotion of public health,
safety, morals, comfort and general welfare. Whenever the regulations of this
Zoning Code require a greater width or size of yards or other open space, or
require a lower height of buildings or a fewer number of stories, or require a
greater percentage of lot to be unoccupied or require a lower density of
population, or require a more restricting use of land, or impose other higher
standards than those required in any other ordinance, regulation, private deed
restriction or private covenants, the provisions of the Zoning Code shall
govern. But if the requirements of other resolutions, regulations, private deed
restriction or private covenants are more restrictive, then they shall govern.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   (b)    A lot shown as a sublot in a subdivision recorded prior to the
enactment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 65-82, passed December 27, 1965) with
area or road frontage less than is provided in such ordinance may be built
upon, with approved building permit, provided that the area or road frontage
not complying with the Zoning Code has at least seventy-five percent (75%) of
the requirements of the Building District of this Code in which such sublot is
located.
(Ord. 87-71. Passed 10- 12-87.)
   1121.03 SEVERABILITY.
   If any article, section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or provision
of this Zoning Code is adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, the same
shall not affect the validity of this Zoning Code as a whole, or any part or
provision thereof, other than the part decided to be invalid or
unconstitutional.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   1121.04 APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be deemed or construed to
repeal, amend, modify, alter or change any other ordinance, or any part
thereof, not specifically repealed, amended, modified, altered or changed
herein, except in such particulars or matters as this Zoning Code is more
restrictive than such other ordinances or parts thereof. In all particulars
wherein this Zoning Code is not more restrictive, each such other ordinance
shall continue and shall be in full force and effect.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   1121.05 AMENDMENTS.
   (a)    Council may, from time to time, on its own motion, or on petition, or
recommendation of the Planning Commission, supplement or change the districts
herein established, but no such amendment shall become effective unless the
ordinance proposing such amendment or change is first submitted to the Planning
Commission who shall have been given a reasonable time, not less than thirty
days, for consideration and report. No such ordinance proposing an amendment or
change which differs from the reports, or has failed to receive the approval of
the Planning Commission shall be passed except by a three-fourths vote of the
full membership of Council.
   (b)    Council may, from time to time, on its own motion, or on petition, or
recommendation of the Planning Commission, supplement or change the regulations
or building lines herein established, but no such amendment shall become
effective unless the ordinance proposing such amendment or change is first
submitted to the Planning Commission who shall have been given a reasonable
time, not less than thirty days, for consideration and report. No such
ordinance proposing an amendment or change which differs from the reports, or
has failed to receive the approval of the Planning Commission shall be passed
except by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of Council.
(Ord. 71-13. Passed 5-10-71.)
   (c)    If any area is hereafter transferred to another district, by change
in the district boundaries by amendment as above described, the provisions of
this Zoning Code with regard to buildings or premises existing at the time of
the passage of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 65-82, passed December 27, 1965)
shall apply to buildings or premises existing in such transferred area at the
time of the passage of such amendment. Should however, such building or
premises be transferred to a more restricted district, its use may continue as
a nonconforming use.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   (d)   Anyone who petitions for a change, supplement or amendment to the
zoning code or for a change in the zoning classification of any property shall
pay the cost of all notices of all public hearings required to be held with
respect to such proposed change, supplement or amendment. At the time the
petition is first submitted to the Planning Commission, the petitioner shall
deposit with the Planning Commission the amount estimated by the Planning
Commission as required to pay the costs of such notices. If the actual cost of
such notices exceeds the amount deposited by the petitioner, the petitioner
shall pay the deficiency upon demand. If the actual cost of such notices is
less than the amount deposited by the petitioner, the Planning Commission shall
refund the excess.

   1123.01 DUTY OF BUILDING INSPECTOR.
   The duty of administering and enforcing the provisions of this Zoning Code
is hereby conferred upon the Building Inspector of the City.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   1123.02 BUILDING PERMITS, CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY AND COMPLIANCE.
   An application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a plat, drawn
to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the parcel of land to be built upon,
the size of the building to be erected, its position on the lot and such other
information as may be deemed necessary for the enforcement of this Zoning Code.
   No vacant land and no building hereafter erected or altered shall be
occupied or used in whole or in part for any purpose whatsoever, and no change
in use shall hereafter be made on any land or in any building or part thereof
until a certificate of occupancy and compliance has been issued by the Building
Inspector, stating that the building or use complies with the provisions of
this Zoning Code. Application for a certificate of occupancy and compliance
shall be filed with the application for a building permit and shall be issued
or refused in writing for cause, within five days after the Building Inspector
has been notified in writing that the erection or alteration of such building
has been completed and is ready for occupancy. A record of such certificates
shall be kept in the office of the Building Inspector. Building an accessory to
dwellings when completed at the same time requires no separate certificates.
   Prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy and compliance, a
temporary certificate may be issued for a period not to exceed six months,
permitting partial occupancy of a building pending completion. Such temporary
certificates shall be revoked by the Building Inspector if, prior to its
completion, the building fails to conform to the provisions of the ordinances
of the City to such a degree as to render it unsafe for occupancy.

   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this Zoning Code shall be fined
not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than fifty dollars ($50.00). Every
day during which such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

(Ord. 86-21. Passed 3-24-86.)
   1125.02 ORGANIZATION; MEETINGS; HEARINGS AND DELIBERATIONS.
   The Board shall elect its own President and Vice-President. The Secretary
shall be an employee of the City. The Board shall adopt such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of
this Zoning Code. Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as
recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the
Board, after notice to the owners of the property or properties shall interpret
the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code.
   All meetings and hearings of the Board shall be public. However, as a quasi-
judicial body, deliberations of the Board on matters submitted to it for
decision may be conducted in private and the members of the Board may vote in
private on any case before the Board. The Board shall keep a record of its
proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or
failing to vote, such fact shall be recorded. The presence of three members
shall constitute a quorum. The concurring vote of three members shall be
necessary to pass upon any matter before the Board. The Secretary shall cause
to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a notice
specifying public hearings to be held by the Board, including the address of
the property involved, names of owners of record and proposed action. Such
notice is to be published not less than ten days prior to the date of the
hearing. The Board shall hold meetings and hearings at such time as the Board
may determine or upon call of its President. (Ord. 10-41. Passed 9-13-10.)
   1125.03 APPEALS.
   Any decision of the Building Inspector made in the enforcement of this
Zoning Code and any decision, notice or order of the Code Official under the
Property Maintenance Code may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals by any
person adversely affected. An appeal may be perfected by the appellant filing
with the Secretary of the Board a notice of his intention to appeal,
accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) for
residential, one hundred dollars ($100.00) for commercial and fifty dollars
($50.00) for a renewal of a variance to cover the cost of advertising the
appeal and the mailing of notices. The final disposition of an appeal shall be
in the form of a resolution either reversing, modifying or affirming the
decision of the Building Inspector or Code Official. If a resolution fails to
receive three votes in favor of the appellant, or in favor of a modification of
the decision appealed from, the action shall be deemed equivalent to a denial
and shall be formally entered upon the record. The Board shall be given a
reasonable time in rendering a decision on an appeal. Such period shall not
exceed fifteen days. With the consent of the appellant, such period may be
extended until the next meeting of the Board.
(Ord. 0-18-34. Passed 10-8-18.)
   1125.04 JURISDICTION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may in specific cases, after public notice is
given as required and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards,
determine and vary the application of the use, height and area regulations and
the building line regulations herein established, in harmony with their general
purpose and intent as follows and authorize the issuance of a permit for:
   (a)    Any public utility building in an R-1, R-2, R-3 and C-1 District
where necessary for public convenience and welfare.
   (b)    The construction of a building beyond the building line to an extent
necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot or parcel of land that
is of such restricted area or such topography that it cannot be improved
without building beyond the building line.
   (c)    A group development within an R-1 or R-2 Residence District upon a
plot of ground containing two or more acres, where the appropriate use of
adjacent property is fully safeguarded and the plans have been approved by the
City Planning Commission and the area requirements of an R-1 or R-2 District
have been met.
   (d)    All cases elsewhere enumerated in this Zoning Code where approval of
the Board is required after public notice and hearing.
   (e)    A building or use in an I-1 District where such building or use is
expressly prohibited, provided such use is distinctly incidental and essential
to the main use of the plant or grounds therein permitted. Such incidental use
of a building or grounds shall not occupy more than ten percent (10%) of the
lot and shall not be located within fifty feet of any street line or
residential district.
   (f)    A private park for a church group or a gun club or a private swimming
pool for an organized group of citizens may be permitted by the Board, subject
to conditions.
   (g)    Conditions Requiring Variances. In all other cases where there is
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the
strict letter of the provisions of this Zoning Code, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall have the power, in a specific case, to vary or modify the
application of any such provisions in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this Zoning Code so that public health, safety, morals and general
welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice done.
   (h)    Limitation of Variance Powers. Such variance shall be limited to
specific cases where:
      (1)    The practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inheres in and is
peculiar to the premises sought to be built upon or used because of physical
size, shape, or other characteristics of the premises or adjoining premises
which differentiate it from other premises in the same district, and create a
difficulty or hardship caused by a strict application of the provisions of this
Zoning Code not generally shared by other land or buildings in the same
district;
      (2)    Refusal of the variance appealed for will deprive the owner of
substantial property rights; and
      (3)    Granting of the variance appealed for will not be contrary to the
purpose and intent of the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (i)    Data on Which Variance is Based. When appealing for a variance, the
appellant shall state and substantiate his claim that the three conditions
listed under subsection (h) hereof exist and the Board shall make a finding on
each of the three conditions as they apply in each specific case as a
prerequisite for the granting of the variance.
   (j)    Variance From Use Regulation. Upon the finding that criteria set
forth in subsection (h) (1), (2) and (3) hereof are met, the Board may grant
variances from the use regulations as follows:
      (1)    The Board may permit, in any use district, the extension of a
building or use existing on the effective date of the use regulations of the
area, into adjoining land in a more restricted district, where land was under
the same ownership on the effective date, under such conditions as will
safeguard the character of the more restricted district;
      (2)    Any use in any district that is not specifically prohibited and
that is in general in keeping with and appropriate to the use as authorized in
such district.

variation from the regulations of this Zoning Code shall be void after six
months from the date of appeal unless, in the case of new construction, work
shall have been done above the foundation walls, and, in the case of occupancy
of land or reconstruction or occupancy of buildings, the operation called for
by the permit shall be under way by the end of six months.
(Ord. 65-82. Passed 12-27-65.)
   1125.06 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may in specific cases authorize
conditional uses for the land, buildings or other structures, if conditional
uses are provided in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   A conditional use shall be permitted in a district only when specified
as a conditional use in such district, and only if such use conforms to the
following standards. Furthermore, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence that:
      (1)   The conditional use in the proposed location will be harmonious and
in accordance with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of this
Code and with the objectives for the district in which located.
      (2)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare.
      (3)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area.
      (4)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood.
      (5)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location
will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
      (6)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      (7)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets; and considering the proximity of access drives to street intersections
relative to the anticipated volume of traffic.
      (8)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools.
      (9)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that may be incompatible.
      (10)   The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (c)   When authorizing a conditional use as provided herein, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may prescribe such additional conditions as are in its opinion
necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.

records or other evidence to be produced is protected from release or
disclosure by common law privilege or by any federal, state or local law.

   1338.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the City of Amherst, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Amherst has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-
21.)
   1338.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Amherst as identified in Section
1338.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Amherst.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective March 9, 2021.
   (b)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Amherst as required by Section 1338.26(c) Subdivisions and Other
New Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Building Department, 480 Park Avenue, Amherst, Ohio
44001.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances or
resolutions, including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance or
resolution, the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not
intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance,
easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes
the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Amherst, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any Section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal. A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevations of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade elevation plus the depth
number (from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; with flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually
sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one (1) foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one (1) square mile; and areas protected
by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Amherst's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Mean sea level. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   (z)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01
(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation, are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and where the individual lots are not for rent
or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. "Manufactured home park" does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.
   (aa)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (bb)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
the City of Amherst and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM, August 1, 1980, or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (cc)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.§111.15
(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (dd)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (hh)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (ii)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period
for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (ll)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (mm)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   (nn)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.12 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Building Official is hereby appointed to administer and implement these
regulations and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.13 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include but are not limited to:
   (a)   Evaluate applications for permits to develop in special flood hazard
areas.
   (b)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and flood

regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Amherst's Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Amherst boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of the City of Amherst suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the City of Amherst has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.23 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1338.27 through
1338.32 through the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
      (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.24 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY.
   (a)   Zone A:
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilize best available data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
      (2)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
      (3)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (4)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1338.26(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C, and X:
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which
are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are encouraged to
reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that the health,
safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.25 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            i.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            ii.   Section
1338.26(i)(1)(B), items (i) and (iii)-(v).
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,

            (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.27 APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   The City of Amherst Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Chapter
1125 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at the Building
Department, 480 Park Avenue, Amherst, Ohio 44001. (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.28 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
   (b)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1338.30 of these regulations.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   
   1338.29 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within fifteen (15) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.30 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee .
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall schedule
and hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other
Sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed uses
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1338.30(c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. (Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)
   1338.31 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   
   (e)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (f)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
(Ord. 21-13. Passed 3-8-21.)

one-fourth gpm per square foot of effective filter area for vacuum filters.
   (b)    The determination of the filter area shall be made on a basis of a
true and effective supported septum surface. In the case of fabric septums, the
area computation will be made on the basis of measurements of the septum
support in a reasonably constant plane. Area allowance shall not be granted for
folds in the septum fabric or deviations in the septum surface which would
easily bridge.
   (c)    The tank containing the filter elements shall be constructed of
steel, plastic or other suitable material, which will satisfactorily provide
resistance to corrosion, with or without coating. Pressure filters shall be
designed for a working pressure equal to the shut-off head of the pump, with a
factor safety of four. Vacuum filters shall be designed to withstand the
pressure developed by the weight of the water contained therein and closed
vacuum filters shall, in addition, be designed to withstand the crushing
pressure developed under a vacuum of twenty-five inches of mercury, both with a
factor safety of 3.5.
   In either type filter where the tank is fabricated from material which is
corroded by water, a suitable corrosion resistant coating shall be applied to
retard such attack.
   (d)    The filter elements shall be fabricated of corrosion resistant
materials throughout. They shall be designed to be adequately resistant to a
differential pressure between influent and effluent of not less than the
maximum pressure which can be developed by the circulating pump and shall be of
adequate strength to resist any additional stresses developed during the
cleaning operation. The filter septum, on which the filter-aid cake is
deposited, shall be provided with openings, the minimum dimensions of which
shall be not greater than 0.005 inches.
   (e)    Provision shall be made to introduce filter aid into the filter in
such a way as to evenly precoat the filter septum before the filter is placed
in operation. The amount of filter aid shall be selected to provide at least
the same protection to the filter septum as would be provided by the use of 0.1
of a pound of diatomite filter aid per square foot of filter area. Use of
additional equipment to provide body feed to the filter influent is optional.
Where provided, such equipment shall have the capacity to continuously and
uniformly feed at a rate of not less than 0.1 of a pound of filter aid per
square foot of filter area per twenty-four hours.
   (f)    The filter piping shall be so designed that, during the precoating
operation, the effluent from the filter shall be recirculated or run to waste
and shall not be fed into the pool until free of filter aid. An exception to
this requirement may be made if the filter septum is of such construction that
no perceptible quantity of filter aid is introduced into the pool when the
effluent discharges therein.
   (g)    Where dissimilar metals are used in the construction of the filter,
which may set up galvanic currents, then suitable provision shall be made to
resist electrolytic corrosion.
   (h)    Filters shall be so designed and installed that they can be readily
disassembled and the filter elements removed.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.08 CARTRIDGE-TYPE FILTERS.
   Cartridge-type filters are those where the cartridge itself is the filter
aid. Cartridge filters can be either pressure or vacuum-type and are subject to
the same general piping and tank specifications as diatomite-type filters.
Replacement cartridges are divided into two types: depth and area. General
specifications, however, are the same for both. Cartridge filters shall not
require the addition of any flocculating agents such as ammonium alum, aluminum
sulfate or potassium alum. They shall be subject to the same requirements
listed under Section
1339.04 for all types of filters. All types of cartridges shall have sufficient
structural strength to resist rupturing, channeling, collapsing or bursting at
a maximum pressure differential of fifty psi. Cartridge seals shall be so
designed as to prevent any bypassing of unfiltered water. If provision is made
for backwashing, it shall be so arranged as to not permit any backwash water to
enter the recirculating system. No residue shall be permitted to remain in the
filter housing that could be picked up in the next filtering cycle.
   Cartridge elements shall be divided into two types:
   (a)    Depth-type cartridges are elements where the porosity varies from the
inlet to the discharge surface. They shall have sufficient depth to provide
adequate dirt-holding capacity and be designed for a flow of no more than one
gallon per minute per five cubic inches of volume with a pressure drop not to
exceed two psi across clean cartridges and not to pass any particulate matter
larger than twenty-five microns.
   (b)    Area or surface-type cartridges are those which rely on the surface
area for their dirt-holding capacity and they shall follow the same flow per
square foot of area as diatomite filters, namely three gallons per minute per
square foot of area for pressure filters and two and one-fourth gallons per
minute per square foot of filter area for vacuum filters.
   (c)    The filter shall be capable of filtering the entire contents of a
pool in eighteen hours or less.
   (d)    Filter capacity shall be such that it need not be cleaned more
frequently than once every four days under proper conditions of water and
operation.
   (e)    All filters shall be designed so as to permit easy removal of the
cartridges.
      (Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.09 RECIRCULATING PUMPS.
   The recirculating pump shall have sufficient capacity to provide the rated
flows of the filter system without exceeding the head loss at which the pump
will deliver such flows. The pump motor shall not be operated at an overload
which exceeds the service factor.
   The pool pump shall be equipped on the inlet side with an approved-type hair
and lint strainer, except for vacuum-type filters where water passes through
the filter before reaching the pump. The basket of the strainer shall be
noncorrosive and have an open screen surface of at least four times the cross-
sectional area of the inlet pipe.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.10 POOL PIPING.
   Pool piping shall be sized to permit the rated flows for filtering and
cleaning without exceeding the maximum head at which the pump will provide such
flows. In general, the water velocity in the pool piping should not exceed ten
feet per second. Where the velocity exceeds ten feet per second, summary
calculations should be provided to show that rated flows are possible with the
pump and piping provided. The recirculating piping and fittings shall meet the
following requirements:
   (a)    The vacuum fitting(s) shall be located in an accessible position(s)
below the water line.
   (b)    A main outlet shall be placed at a deep point in every pool for
recirculating and/or emptying the pool.
   (c)    Pool recirculation piping, passing through the pool structure, shall
be copper tubing with a minimum wall thickness of Type "L" brass, virgin
plastic or an approved equal.
   (d)    Filtered water inlet(s) shall be provided in sufficient quantity and
shall be properly spaced to provide a maximum circulation of the main body and
surface of the pool water.
   (e)    A recirculating skimming device shall be provided to skim the surface
of the pool.
   (f)    All materials used in a pool recirculating system shall be nontoxic.
      (Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.11 VALVES.
   Fullway valves shall be installed throughout to insure proper functioning of
the filtration and piping system.
   (a)    A valve shall be installed on the main suction line located in an
accessible place outside the walls of the pool when the pump is below the
overflow rim of the pool.
   (b)    Valves up to and including two inches in size shall be brass. Sizes
over two inches may have cast iron or brass bodies. All working parts of valves
shall be noncorrosive material.
   (c)    Combination valves may be installed if the materials and design
comply with the intent of these standards.
      (Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.12 HEATERS.
   Gas-fired swimming pool heaters and swimming pool boilers must comply with
all applicable American Standard Approval requirements, including American Gas
Association and American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards. Oil burning
equipment must be approved by Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., or another
nationally recognized testing agency. All such equipment shall carry the
corresponding seal of approval by the appropriate agencies.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.13 WATER SUPPLY.
   The potable water supply to any swimming pool shall be installed as required
in AWWA Standards.
   (a)    Unless an approved type of filling system is installed, such as is
required by AWWA, any source of water which may be used to fill the pool shall
be equipped with backflow protection,
   (b)    No over-the-rim fill spout will be accepted unless located under a
diving board or installed in a manner approved by local authorities so as to
remove any hazard.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.14 TESTS.
   All pool piping and the installation and construction of the pool piping
system shall be in accordance with the approved plans. The entire pool piping
system shall be tested and proved tight.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.15 CHEMICAL TREATMENT.
   The pool owner shall be instructed in the proper care and maintenance of the
pool, including the use of high test calcium hypochlorite (dry chlorine
carrier) or sodium hypochlorite (liquid chlorine carrier), or an equally
effective germicide and algaecide and the importance of proper pH (alkalinity
and acidity) control.
(Ord. B-751. Passed 7-9-62.)
   1339.16 FENCES.
   (a)    Every person owning land on which there is situated a permanent
swimming pool, fish pond or other body of water, which constitutes an obvious
hazard and contains eighteen inches or more in depth at any point, shall erect
and maintain thereon a continuous man-made barrier around or by the side of any
open space to prevent passage, or for its protection, from the ground up at a
minimum height of four feet and a maximum height of six feet, which would make
the body of water inaccessible to small children. All gates shall be self-
latching with latches placed four feet above the underlying ground or otherwise
made inaccessible from the outside to small children.
   (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (a) hereof, a
fence for aboveground pools may be constructed on top of the pool and such
fence shall be a minimum of thirty inches in height.
(Ord. 83-69. Passed 12-12-83.)
   1339.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined not
more than fifty dollars ($50.00). Any such violation shall constitute a
separate offense on each successive day continued.

Nuisances - see Ohio R.C. Ch. 3767
   1343.01 NUISANCE DECLARED; DEFINITION.
   All automobile service stations and filling stations which at the effective
date of this section (Ordinance 73-46, passed October 22, 1973) or anytime
thereafter are abandoned for use as a filling station or automobile service
station shall be presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding
property values and to be detrimental to the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, property or general welfare of the community and shall be
abated.
   For purposes of this chapter, an abandoned automobile service station or
filling station means one which the owner or lessee has failed to operate for
at least six consecutive months in any twelve month period.
(Ord. 73-46. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1343.02 NOTICE TO ABATE; CITY MAY TAKE ACTION.
   Whenever the Building Inspector finds any automobile service station or
filling station to be abandoned within the meaning of this chapter, he shall
give notice in the same manner as service of summons in civil cases or by
certified mail addressed to the owner of record of the premises at his last
known address or to the address to which tax bills are sent or by a combination
of the foregoing methods to abate such abandoned condition within sixty days
either by placing the station in operation in accordance with this Building
Code, adapting or using the building for another permitted business use or by
razing the service station structure. Adaption or razing shall include removing
the pumps and signs, abandoning the underground storage tanks in accordance
with accepted safe practice as prescribed by the National Fire Protection
Association in Appendix C to NFPA Number 30 under the supervision of the
Division of Fire, filling depressions to the grade level of the lot. However,
if the station is in operation at the time notice is given and remains in
operation for ninety consecutive days thereafter, the provisions of this
section shall not apply and if there should be declared a national emergency
which curtails the operation of motor vehicles or if Council determines that
there exists a state of general economic depression or if the closure of such
station results from street widening, sewer installation or some other public
improvement, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply. For good cause
shown, an extension for a reasonable period not to exceed ninety days per
extension may be granted by the Building Inspector. Upon the failure, neglect
or refusal of any such owner to comply with the notice to abate such
abandonment, the Building Inspector shall take such action as may be necessary
to abate the nuisance.
(Ord. 73-46. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1343.03 MAINTENANCE.
   Inoperative service stations which do not come within the definition of
abandoned service stations and filling stations shall be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of this Building Code and the owner shall cut
all grass and remove all rubbish and weeds from the premises. The parking of
motor vehicles upon the premises shall be prohibited and the owner shall place
in the window of such service station a sign at least ten square feet in area
prohibiting parking and trespassing.
(Ord. 73-46. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1343.04 ENFORCEMENT OF MAINTENANCE .
   Whenever the appropriate municipal authority finds the requirements of
Section
1343.03 have not been complied with, he shall give notice in the same manner as
service of summons in civil cases or by certified mail addressed to the owner
of record of the premises at his last known address or to the address to which
tax bills are sent or by a combination of the foregoing methods to comply with
Section
1343.03. Upon failure, neglect or refusal of any such owner to comply
therewith, the appropriate municipal authority shall take such action as may be
necessary to enforce compliance.

   1347.06 RESERVED.
   This section is reserved for future legislation.
   1347.07  STORMWATER SYSTEM COMPOSITION AND DESIGN.
   (a)    The Stormwater Runoff Management System shall be composed of:
      (1)    A primary system;
      (2)    A secondary 100 year flood system; and
      (3)    A secondary 10 year flood system.
   (b)   EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsections (b), (c) and (d) were deleted by
Ordinance 98-12, passed February 23, 1998.
   (e)    The design and construction of drainage systems shall be such that
watercourse
traversing the project and natural water emanating from within the project
shall be carried through and off the project without injury to improvements,
building sites or buildings existing or to be installed within or adjacent to
the project. Drainage water entering the project shall be received and
discharged at locations and as nearly as possible in the manner that existed
prior to construction of the drainage facilities within the project. The design
of drainage facilities within the project shall be such that they shall conform
to the ultimate drainage requirements of the land uses within the project
watershed.
      (1)   The primary system shall be constructed and maintained under
Chapter
1338, Flood Damage Prevention Standards.
      (2)   The secondary 100 year flood system shall be designed to allow
uphill storm water to flow onto and through the project whenever the ten year
flood system is filled to and overflowing its capacity.
            It shall be designed to prevent the flooding of the main floor of
buildings existing or to be constructed within the project and to further
prevent the flooding of the main floor of the building downhill and uphill from
the project.
            It may utilize open ditches, existing drainageways, drainage
swales, open channels, roadways, public rights of way, temporary and permanent
detention basins and temporary detention of stormwater runoff in wet bottom
basins, dry bottom basins, parking lots, rooftops, percolation storage or other
means approved by the City Engineer.
      (3)   The secondary ten year flood system shall be designed to prevent
the possible flooding against building walls of existing and future building
construction on the site and to prevent the flooding against building walls of
existing and future buildings on adjacent sites. It shall be designed to drain
standing storm water from the site within six hours after the termination of
any ten year storm. When swales are not steep enough to accomplish this, a
drain tile and storm water inlet shall be constructed in the low point of yards
and drained through tile to a public storm sewer or ditch. It shall utilize
storm sewers, yard slope and drainage swales to contain uphill and on site
stormwater within the site which shall be discharged to a public storm sewer or
ditch and not allowed to discharge onto adjacent property not part of a public
ditch or storm sewers. Yards shall be graded and maintained to drain away from
buildings within an eight foot perimeter of buildings to swales or catch basins
channeled to prevent storm water damage to adjacent properties. Minimum grade
over sod or grounds shall be one-fourth inch per foot. Minimum grade over
concrete or pavement shall be one-eighth inch per foot.

The above slopes shall be maintained to a ditch and/or a storm sewer and
catch basin, designed to prevent the flooding of the pavement during a ten
year flood. The above slopes shall be maintained even when a ditch is filled.

* Unless a catch basin to a ten year storm sewer is located within twenty
feet on either
side and within fifty feet of each other on either side of the driveway for
shoulder to drain into or a ten year ditch is constructed and maintained
along roadway and a culvert is constructed under the driveway.

* * This slope shall drain to a catch basin or a ditch.

* * * On hilly roads a slope shall be maintained away from the pavement
including the
slope over driveways to prevent the street pavement base from washing out due
to
the velocity of the water running down the roadway and/or water from flooding
onto the pavement during any ten year flood.
   (f)   When a ditch or storm sewer drains across private property an easement
shall be obtained and/or provided.
   (g)   Driveways may not intersect the pavement higher than the pavement
edge. This is to prevent a snow plow from catching the edge of the driveway.
   (h)   Culverts under driveways shall be installed large enough and steep
enough to prevent flooding of the pavement during any ten year flood and shall
be constructed in anticipation of any downstream blockage removal and/or
replacement. Culvert tile shall be reinforced concrete and be a minimum size of
twelve inches unless a storm sewer already exists along the street which is
designed for ten year flooding, thereby allowing an eight inch culvert tile.
   (i)   The top of a culvert pipe shall be located at least five inches below
the pavement edge to allow a swale for roadway to drain to in the event the
culvert tile are extended across the lot. This may mean that the bottom of the
tile is located below the bottom of the ditch or other adjacent tile. Tile
shall be installed with a downhill grade of at least four inches in every 100
feet of length.
   (j)   When replacing an existing driveway culvert the City will “set the
pipe” if you purchase and deliver the concrete pipe to the site.
   (k)   Parking lots for commercial, industrial and multifamily buildings
shall not drain onto any City street pavement.
   (l)   Driveway culverts, roadway swales and ditches shall be maintained by
owner and a permit is required to install or regrade. The fee is one dollar
($1.00).
(Ord. 87-80. Passed 11-9-87.)
   1347.08 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements to the City for the maintenance of storm sewers shall be of
width and alignment as stated in the subdivision ordinance and shall be
indicated on a plat or on an easement deed and shall be accepted by Council.
   (b)   EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (b) hereof was deleted by Ordinance
98-12, passed February 23, 1998.
   (c)   Easements for mutual benefit of owners shall be provided in a form
ready for recording and shall include a provision to be maintained by the
property owner for the benefit of the uphill property owners with provision
that any disputes shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association.
(Ord. 87-80. Passed 11-9-87.)

   Yards shall be graded to drain away from buildings without draining onto
adjacent property. A water inlet catch basin shall be constructed at each low
point in the rear yard unless swales are constructed deep enough to drain water
to the street or to a public ditch. Within an eight foot perimeter of the
building the minimum grade over ground shall be one-fourth inch per foot (two
inches) and over pavement one-eighth inch per foot (one inch) which grade shall
continue to the street or to a catch basin which shall remove any standing
water within six hours after termination of a storm.

When the street pavement does not have a curb, a ditch or swale shall be
constructed between the pavement and the sidewalk to City specifications. The
sidewalk may be located lower than the pavement when there is no curb along the
pavement, provided that the sidewalk drains toward the ditch.
An expansion strip the depth and width of the concrete and at least one-half
inch thick shall be placed next to the curb or pavement edge, around hydrants
and poles and next to buildings.
Concrete drives, sidewalks and pavement shall have a medium broom finish.
Concrete sidewalks shall have a joint or be sawed at least every eight feet
vertical to the curb.
Sandstone curbs and/or sidewalks shall be replaced with concrete whenever new
drives are constructed.
Existing sidewalks may not be removed unless they are replaced with new
sidewalks.
Residential sidewalks when being replaced may be replaced at the same width as
an existing walk. Commercial walks shall be of the new width.
When replacing existing curbs, they shall be constructed to a depth of eighteen
inches deep, six inches wide and not less than the height of the adjacent curb.
When replacing an existing driveway culvert, the City shall "set the pipe" if
you purchase and deliver the concrete pipe to the site.
A permit shall be required from the Building Inspector before construction or
replacing a driveway, sidewalk, culvert or to cover a ditch. The fee shall be
one dollar ($1.00).
The concrete in a concrete street will expand, therefore: a concrete drive
shall have a free expansion space of at least one inch for each 500 feet of
concrete street located ahead of the drive (on a curve in the street or at the
end of a dead end street or a cul de sac, etc.) to prevent the expansion of the
concrete in the street from pushing the back wall of the garage off the
foundation.

   1347.10 LOT GRADING PLAN.
   (a)    No building permits required under Chapter
1337 for the erection, construction, remodeling or alteration of, addition to,
or moving of any building shall be issued unless a lot grading plan which has
been certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor has first been
submitted by the applicant and approved by the City Engineer or Building
Inspector.
   (b)    If the City Engineer has determined that the lot is subject to
retention of stormwater, the lot grading plan shall include the retention
design and design calculations shall also be submitted. The design calculations
for retention design shall be approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)    The lot grading plan shall be drawn at a scale no less than one inch
equals fifty feet, and shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1)    Show complete title, location, address, engineer or surveyor
certification, list of symbols and abbreviations, and date;
      (2)    Show lot area in square feet;

fourth inch per foot on all sides for a minimum of eight feet;
      (3)    Building foundations shall extend a minimum of eight inches above
the ground;
      (4)    Swales shall be constructed along the side lot lines so that water
ponding on the site shall not flood the building on the site or adjacent
buildings. Swales along the side lot lines shall be designed for the use of
adjacent property owners.
   (e)    After the lot grading plan has been approved, the building permit has
been issued, and construction has begun, but prior to proceeding with

constructed and approved by the proper municipal authority shall present a lot
grading plan conforming to the requirements stated herein. After the changes or
alterations have been made, a letter shall be presented to the Building
Inspector from a licensed professional engineer or surveyor that he has checked
the grades and that the lot is in conformance with the approved lot grading
plan.
(Ord. 94-24. Passed 3-14-94.)
   1347.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined not

(Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.11  EROSION CONTROL AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (a)    (1)   Requirements.    No person shall cause or allow earth-
disturbing activities, land clearing, grading, excavating, or filling except in
compliance with the performance criteria set out in subsection (b) hereof. If
the construction site is subject to regulations of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Storm Water permit for Construction Activity, the controls must satisfy
the performance criteria set out in subsection (b) hereof, and any additional
requirements of Part III.G.2 of the NPDES permit. If either subsection (b) or
the NPDES requirement is more restrictive than the other, the more stringent
requirement applies.
         (Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
       (2)    Erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy the
performance criteria shall meet the standard and specifications in the current
edition of Rainwater and Land Development (formerly Water Management and
Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas) (Ohio Department of Natural Resources).
The engineer should design and implement control practices which go beyond
these minimum requirements.
      (3)    The performance criteria are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the City of Amherst to impose additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the criteria limit the right of the City of Amherst to
waive individual requirements.
   (b)    Performance Criteria.
      (1)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices. Sediment trapping practices
shall be functional throughout all earth-disturbing activity. Settling
facilities, sediment barriers and other practices intended to trap sediment
shall be set up prior to grading and within seven (7) days from the start of
grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope development area
is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography is
altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls altered
to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas. Denuded areas have soil
stabilization applied within seven (7) days if they are to remain dormant for
more than twenty-one (21) days. For areas within 15 meters (50 feet) of any
stream, soil stabilization shall be initiated within two (2) days on all
inactive, disturbed areas. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be
applied to denuded areas within seven (7) days after a final grade is reached
on any portion of the site.
      (3)   Settling Facilities.
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at
rates that exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through a
sediment-settling facility. The facility shall be designed according to
Rainwater and Land Development, current edition.
         B.   A centralized sedimentation basin shall be utilized for common
drainage areas equal to or greater than ten (10) acres.
      (4)   Sediment Barrier. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by sediment barriers. Sediment barriers, such as sediment fences or
diversions directing runoff to settling facilities, shall protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment transported by sheet flow.
      (5)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
         A.   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer system without first being treated to remove sediment, unless
the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility.
         B.   There shall be no sediment-laden discharges to surface water of
the state resulting from dewatering activities. If any sediment- laden ground
water is encountered during trenching activities, then the sediment-laden
ground water must pass through an effective sediment control device prior to
being discharged from the construction site.
         C.   Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid, sanitary,
and toxic wastes, dumpsters, concrete truck washout pits, and fuel tanks shall
be shown on the storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3).
      (6)   Working In or Cross Streams.
         A.   To the maximum extent possible, earth-disturbing activities
should be restricted in the buffer strip.
         B.   To the extent practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept
out of streams. Where in-channel work is unavoidable, precautions shall be
taken to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion.
Streams, including bed and banks, shall be restablized after in-channel work is
completed, interrupted or stopped.
         C.   If a stream must be crossed by construction vehicles regularly
during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
      (7)   Construction Access Routes. Measures shall be taken to prevent soil
transport onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls, or
onto public roads. Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be
implemented as required by the City Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be
planned and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition
of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual. Soils transported onto roads
shall be removed by either sweeping or scraping at the end of each work day.
Water or water streams shall never be used to remove sediment from the roadway.
Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable equipment to
cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g., wood and stone) can be used.
      (8)   Sloughing and Dumping.
         A.   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is
authorized by the Chief of Amherst and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, for such purposes as, but not limited to, construction of bridges,
culverts, and erosion control structures.
         B.   Unstable soils prone to slipping or landslides shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
done according to a qualified professional geotechnical engineer’s
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address such problems.
      (9)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a way that will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given
to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope drainage area,
ground water conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (10)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels. Outfalls and constructed
or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the
expected velocity from the critical year storm as defined in Section
1348.12(b).
      (11)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. Permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the City of Amherst, provides adequate cover
and is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive
adverse weather conditions.
      (12)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary erosion and
sediment control practices shall be removed or permanently stabilized within
thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the
City of Amherst.
      (13)   Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance
requirements. They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure
continued performance of their intended function and in accordance with Part
III.G.2. of the NPDES permit for construction activity. The person or entity
responsible for the continued maintenance of permanent erosion controls shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the City of Amherst.
      (14)   Inspections. Inspections and documentation shall be completed in
accordance with Part III.G.2.i. of the NPDES permit for construction activity
and the regulations set forth in herein. The construction site operator shall
provide that all controls on the site are inspected by qualified inspection
personnel once every seven days and within twenty- four hours of 0.5 inches or
greater rainfall. If inspection reveals the need for corrective action by the
construction site operator, it must be completed in accordance with Part
III.G.2.i. of the NPDES permit.
         A.   Documentation. The owner, or his designated representative, shall
keep a written log of each inspection and any subsequent changes to the soil
erosion, sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspection
procedures and log must become part of the storm water pollution prevention
plan (SWP3). This log should indicate the date of inspection, name(s) and
qualifications of personnel making the inspection, weather conditions,
observations, certification as to whether the facility is in compliance with
the SWP3 and NPDES permit, and actions taken to correct any problems and the
date action was taken. A copy of all of the inspection log sheets must be
submitted to the Utilities Superintendent and City Engineer within three (3)
working days of the date that the inspection was conducted.
      (15)   Control of Materials and Debris. Site management practices shall
be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the City’s and State’s water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, gypsum and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the
proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.
         B.   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch
basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A
designated area for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all
concrete washouts.
         C.   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage
area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum
capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage
area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed.
If the fuel tanks have a self-contained “dike,” the plug will be kept in the
“dike” tank at all times.
         D.   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
         E.   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
         F.   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on
solid waste landfill sites.
         G.   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint
wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
            1.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of
excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected
sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
            2.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site’s hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
         H.   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all
times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the
construction.
         I.   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
            (Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
   1348.12 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   To protect property from flood damage and channel erosion, and to protect
water resources from degradation resulting from accelerated storm water flows,
all development areas shall be designated and constructed according to these
regulations. If the construction site is subject to regulations of the Ohio
EPA’s NPDES permit, the post construction storm water management best
management practices must satisfy any additional requirements of Part
III.G.2.e. of the NPDES permit, or the regulations set out in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, whichever is more restrictive.
(Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
   (a)   Requirements.
      (1)   Storm water management systems shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the land. Areas developed for a subdivision shall provide a storm water
management system for the ultimate development of all the subdivided lots.
      (2)    Storm water management facilities shall be designed and
constructed so that they will continually function with minimal maintenance.
      (3)    Storm water management facilities shall be designed and
constructed as a multi-use facility wherever practical.
      (4)    Storm water management facilities shall be designed and
constructed with specific regard to safety.
      (5)    The design criteria shall be applied to each watershed within the
development area. The City of Amherst does not allow post-development drainage
to cross pre-development drainage divides, therefore all pre- and post-
development runoff rates and volumes shall be calculated using their respective
drainage divides.
   (b)    Storm Water Management Design Criteria. 
      (1)   The runoff rate from the development area shall not be greater
after development than it was before development.
      (2)    Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by further
restricting run off rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm, post-development, shall be restricted to
the one year pre-development storm runoff rate. The term critical storm is
defined in Section
1348.10 (b).
         The critical storm shall be calculated as follows:
         A.   Determine by appropriate hydrologic methods the total volume of
runoff from a one year frequency, twenty-four hour storm occurring on the
development area before and after development.
         B.   From the volume determined in subsection (b)(2)A. hereof,
determine the percent increase in the runoff volume due to development.
         C.   Using this percentage, select the critical storm from the
following table:
If the percent of increase in runoff volume is:
Equal to or greater than               The critical storm runoff rate
                         And less than will be limited to:
0                        10            1 year
10                       20            2 years
20                       50            5 years
50                       100           10 years
100                      250           25 years
250                      500           50 years
500                      –           100 years
   Source: Model Regulations Water Management and Sediment Control
   (c)    Calculations Required for Submittal.
      (1)   Submitted calculations should show that the peak rate of runoff
from the critical storm and all more frequent storms occurring on the
development area does not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one year
frequency, twenty-four hour storm occurring on the same area under pre-
development conditions.
      (2)   Submitted calculations should also show that storms of less
frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the critical storm up to the
100 year storm, have peak runoff rates no greater than the peak runoff rates
from equivalent storms under predevelopment conditions. Consideration of the
one, two, five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and 100 year storms will be considered
in design and construction to meet this standard.
   (d)    Calculation Methods. The selection of a calculation method should be
based upon the size of the drainage area and the output information required.
The engineer selecting the calculation method and/or performing the calculation
shall do so with full knowledge of the method's limitations, applicable
conditions and degree of accuracy. The City of Amherst reserves the right to
reject any calculation method it deems inappropriate for the given situation.
The "rational method" shall not be considered an appropriate calculation method
in determining the critical storm.
   (e)    Methods for Controlling Runoff. Methods for controlling increases in
the rate and volume of storm water runoff may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction;
      (2)   Grading and construction of terraces or diversions to slow runoff
by diffusion, or use of grade control structures;
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into the soil
where practical;
      (4)   Provisions for detention of storm water.
      Specific methods for controlling storm water runoff are contained in the
latest edition of “Rainwater and Land Development” and other sources.
   (f)    Storm Water Facility Maintenance. The responsible party shall
maintain all storm water management facilities for eighteen months following
final inspection and acceptance. All storm water management facilities shall be
maintained to meet the design standards and the provisions of these
regulations. Failure to maintain the improvement during the eighteen month
maintenance period may result in action against the owner and/or developer
according to Section
1348.14.
      Following the eighteen month period described above, the City of Amherst
or the designated homeowners' association shall be responsible for permanent
maintenance of storm water management facilities and other facilities designed
to manage storm water runoff when the land served involves two or more property
owners. An inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent
owners of land draining into the storm water facilities shall be developed as
part of the design criteria. Such agreements shall provide access to the
facilities, at reasonable times, for regular inspection by the City of Amherst
to ensure that the facility is maintained to meet design standards and the
provisions of these regulations. Such agreements or restrictions shall be
recorded on the deed for the property, and reference thereon be made to the
entity or individual(s) to be responsible for maintenance. The location,
dimensions and bearing of storm water facilities and easements shall be
recorded on the deed, or when in an approved subdivision, on the final plat,
and reference thereon be made to the entity or individual(s) responsible for
maintenance.
   (g)    Easements and Rights of Way. Permanent access and access easements
required to perform inspection and maintenance of storm water control
structures, storm water conveyance systems, permanent vegetative plantings and
other conservation practices shall be provided as follows:
      (1)    Access to flood control storm drainage ditches, channels, and
storage facilities, shall be by means of easements. Such easements shall not be
less than six meters (twenty feet) in width, exclusive of the width of the
ditch, channel, or other facility it is to serve, and an easement of this type
shall be provided at least on one side of the flood control or storm drainage
ditch, channel, or similar type facility.
      (2)    Access along the storm sewers shall be by means of easements. Such
easements shall not be less than six meters (twenty feet) in width, with a
minimum width of two meters (five feet) on each side of the center line.
      (3)    Access around storm water storage facilities shall be a eight
meter (twenty- five foot) easement in the case of dry bottom detention basins,
and a eight meter (twenty-five foot) easement with a eight meter (twenty-five
foot) level beach in the case of wet bottom detention basins, measured from the
top of bank and shall include the storage facility itself.
      (4)    Easements for the emergency flow ways shall be a minimum of six
meters (twenty feet) in width or larger if required.
      (5)    Flood control or storm drainage easement containing underground
facilities, shall have a minimum width of six meters (twenty feet).
      (6)    Those lots crossed by an easement are restricted against the
planting within said easement of trees, shrubbery or planting with woody growth
characteristics, and against the construction therein of buildings, fences,
walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment, and, also restricted against the
changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan.
         (Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.13  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
   It is the intent of the City of Amherst to ensure that before any earth-
disturbing activity begins, all state and federal permits have been granted.
State and federal permits which may be required include, but are not limited
to: Section 404 permit granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Section 401
water quality certification issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency,
a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and a permit for the construction of
dams, dikes, and levees as required by the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water.
   (a)    According to the federal Clean Water Act, anyone (including private
citizens, federal, state and local agencies) who wishes to discharge dredged or
fill material into waters of the U.S., including all wetlands, must obtain a
Section 404 permit and a Section 401 water quality certification. A Section 401
water quality certification must be obtained before a Section 404 permit is
granted.
      Examples of activities which may require a Section 404 permit and a
Section 401 water quality certification include: placement of riprap for
erosion protection, placing fill, grading, ditching, stream channelization and
stream diversion.
   (b)    Any discharge of water, with certain exceptions for storm water, from
a point source must be covered by a permit from the Ohio EPA. Federal
regulations at 40 CFR 122 and the Ohio Revised Code at Section 6111.04 prohibit
point source discharges to waters of the State without first obtaining a NPDES
permit. This includes point source discharges of storm water associated with
industrial and construction activity, among others.
         To fulfill the requirements of a NPDES permit, a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan must be developed for the proposed site. In addition a Notice
of Intent (NOI) application must be submitted to the Ohio EPA certifying an
applicant's intention to comply with the permit.
   (c)    According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, no dam may be
constructed for the purpose of storing, conserving, or retarding water, or for
any other purpose, nor shall any dike or levee be constructed for the purpose
of diverting or retaining flood waters unless the person or governmental agency
desiring the construction has a construction permit for the dam, dike, or levee
issued by the chief of the division of water of the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources. Some construction projects may be exempt from the above requirement.
The person or governmental agency shall check with ODNR to determine whether
the proposed project is exempt.
      (Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   (d)    (1)   When the development area involves the construction of a
proposed subdivision of more than five lots or the development is subject to
the requirements of the NPDES permit for construction activity, the subdivider
shall submit all required state and federal permits to the Amherst City
Engineer at the same time construction drawings are being submitted for final
approval. The SWP3 developed as part of the NPDES permit requirement must also
be submitted at this time. The City Engineer shall check to ensure that all
required permits have been obtained. In addition, the City Engineer will review
the SWP3 to ensure that it has been developed in accordance with the Ohio EPA
requirements. If the City Engineer determines that SWP3 does not meet Ohio EPA
requirements, the SWP3 will be returned to the subdivider so that the SWP3 can
be revised and resubmitted for approval.
   In the event that the subdivider has applied for but not yet received a
state or federal permit, the subdivider may submit a copy of the application to
the City Engineer to prevent delays in submitting final construction plans for
review. The City Engineer shall not, however, grant final approval of the
proposed subdivision until all required permits have been submitted and the
SWP3 has been accepted.
         (Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
      (2)   When the development area involves the construction of five lots or
less, or involves a commercial or industrial site, the developer shall submit
all required state and federal permits to the City of Amherst building
department at the same time that a grading plan or other required information
is being submitted for approval. The SWP3 must also be submitted at this time.
The Building Inspector shall check to ensure that all required permits have
been obtained. In addition, the Building Inspector will review the SWP3 to
ensure that it has been developed in accordance with Ohio EPA requirements. If
the Building Inspector determines that the SWP3 does not meet these
requirements, the SWP3 will be returned to the developer so that the SWP3 can
be revised and resubmitted for approval. The building department shall not
grant building permits until all required permits have been submitted and the
SWP3 has been accepted.
      (3)   Before approval and acceptance of improvements is made by the City
of Amherst, the subdivider or developer must submit to the City Engineer a copy
of the Notice of Termination (NOT) as required by the Ohio EPA declaring that
the site has reached final stabilization.
   (e)    All earth-disturbing activities shall be subject to site inspection
by the City of Amherst to determine compliance with these regulations.
      (Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.14  INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   As part of the general requirements for a NPDES permit, the SWP3 must be
retained on-site at all times during construction activity. In addition, the
NPDES permit requires that sediment and erosion controls be inspected by the
subdivider or developer, or their duly authorized agents, once every seven days
and within twenty-four hours of 0.5 inches or greater rainfall. A written log,
as required by Part III.G.2.i. of the NDPES permit for construction activity,
of these inspections must become part of the SWP3. This log should indicate the
date of inspection, name(s) of and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection, weather conditions, observations, certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance, actions taken to correct any problems and the date
action was taken. A copy of each of the inspection logs or records must be
submitted to the Utilities Superintendent and City Engineer within three (3)
working days of the date that the inspection was conducted.
(Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
   (a)   The City of Amherst or its representatives may inspect any development
area to determine compliance with the state and federal permits and these
regulations. In addition, the SWP3 shall be made readily available during any
inspection. When it is determined that there is a violation or the development
area is not in compliance, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The inspector representing the City of Amherst shall notify the
site superintendent of the violation and the work required to be in compliance
with all permits and these regulations. Notification must be written.
      (2)   Three working days following the inspection during which the
violation was noted or after a time period mutually agreed upon by the
inspector and the site superintendent, the inspector shall reinspect the site.
      (3)    If the violation still exists, The City of Amherst may issue, by
certified mail or courier, an order to comply. The order shall describe the
problem and the work required, and specify a date by which the work must be
completed.
      (4)    On the date specified in the order to comply, the site shall be
reinspected.
      (5)    If the City of Amherst determines that a violation still exists,
one or all of the following options may be pursued:
         A.   Contacting the state or federal agency whose permit is being
violated, request that the permit be revoked and that the agency begins its own
enforcement procedures.
         B.   An injunction or other appropriate relief may be sought through
the court of competent jurisdiction.
         C.   Suspension of any Amherst issued permits. No earth-disturbing
activity shall proceed without the proper permits.
            (Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.15  VIOLATION OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated
any of the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation.
   (b)   Violations of these regulations which will result in enforcement
actions, include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Failure to install control practices specified in the state and
federal permits.
      (2)   Improper installation of control practices according to “Rainwater
and Land Development” and/or as recommended by the manufacturer.
      (3)   Inadequate design and/or unacceptable performance of the control
practices as judged by the Amherst City Engineer.
      (4)   Failure to properly maintain control practices put in place as
judged by the Amherst City Engineer.
      (5)   Failure to remove control practices after the site has reached
final stabilization.
         (Ord. 05-89. Passed 11-14-05.)
   1348.16 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   (a)    Suspension of Permits. Permits issued by the City of Amherst and
subject to suspension, shall not be re-instated until a hearing is held before
the Amherst City Council.
   (b)   Legal Offense. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure
to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. The court of competent jurisdiction may levy a fine of up to one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per day the violation exists.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.17 VARIANCES.
   (a)   The City of Amherst may grant a variance to these regulations where
the owner or his appointed representative can show that a hardship exists under
which compliance with these regulations is not appropriate, based upon the
following:
      (1)   That exceptional topographic or other physical conditions exist
that are peculiar to the particular parcel of land.
      (2)   That the literal interpretation of these regulations would deprive
the owner of rights enjoyed by other property owners.
   (b)   Adverse economic conditions or hardship shall not be considered as a
valid reason for a variance request to be granted. No variances will be granted
where activities occur that will defeat the purposes of these regulations.
   (c)   The request for variance shall be submitted to the Amherst City
Engineer and shall state the specific variances sought and include sufficient
information to justify the granting of a variance.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)
   1348.18 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the City of Amherst or its representatives in relation to
this regulation may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. Such appeal shall be
made within thirty days of the date of an order or decision and shall specify
the grounds for appeal.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 2-23-98.)

using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna or tower must be
placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its necessary function in the
company's grid system.
   (b)   (1)    If the cellular communications company proposes to build a
cellular communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the
owners of nearby structures within a one (1) mile radius of the site proposed,
asked for permission to install the cellular communications antenna on those
structures, and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. "Tall
structures" shall include, but not be limited to: Smoke stacks, water towers,
buildings over fifty (50) feet in height, antenna support structures of other
cellular communication companies, other communication towers and roadway
lighting poles.
      (2)    The City may deny the application to construct a new cellular
communications tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount
the antenna on existing structures.

antenna unless sufficient lighting is added to any structure which reaches more
than 100 feet in height and is less than 200 feet in height.
(Ord. 00-85. Passed 9-25-00.)
   1349.05 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL OF ALL CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND
TOWERS.
   (a)    Antenna/Tower Height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No
antenna that is taller than the minimum height shall be approved.
   (b)    Setbacks from the Base of the Tower. If a new cellular communications
tower is to be constructed, the minimum distance between the base of the tower
or any guy wire anchors and the property line shall be the greatest of the
following:
      (1)    Forty (40) percent of the tower height;
      (2)    The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district; or
      (3)    Fifty (50) feet.
   
   (c)    Cellular Communications Tower Safety. The applicant shall demonstrate
that the proposed cellular communications tower and its antenna are safe and
that the surrounding properties will not be negatively affected by tower
failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio frequency
interference. Furthermore, all cellular communications towers shall be fitted
with anti-climbing devices as approved by the manufacturers.
   (d)    Fencing. A fence shall be required around the cellular communications
tower and its support structures(s), unless the antenna is mounted on an
existing structure. The fence shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in height
and shall be erected to prevent access to nonauthorized personnel.
   (e)    Landscaping.
      (1)    The following landscaping shall be required to screen as much of
the support structures as possible, the fence surrounding the cellular
communications tower, support structure(s) and any other ground level features
and, in general, soften the appearance of the cellular communications site. The
City may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls,
decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the
same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted
on an existing structure, and other equipment is housed inside of an existing
structure, landscaping shall not be required.
      (2)    Any freestanding cellular communications tower shall incorporate
landscaping which includes trees, shrubs and other landscaping vegetation that
is subject to review and is acceptable to the Planning Commission. In addition,
existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest
extent possible.
   (f)    Limiting the Number of Cellular Communications Towers. In order to
reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the City in the
future, the proposed cellular communications tower shall be required to
accommodate other users, including other cellular communications companies, and
local police, fire, and ambulance departments.
   (g)    Licensing. The cellular communications company must demonstrate to
the City that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
   (h)    Required Parking. If the cellular communications site is fully
automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the
site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal
the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in the Zoning Code.
   (i)    Appearance. Cellular communications towers under 200 feet in height
shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order to reduce
visual impact. Cellular communications towers under 200 feet in height, but
extending into the air over 100 feet in height shall be equipped with
sufficient lighting to alert helicopters that this tower is in the flight path.
The lighting shall be comparable to that required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) for towers over two hundred feet in height. Cellular
communications towers shall meet all other FAA requirements. Furthermore, no
cellular communication towers or antenna shall contain any signage containing a
commercial message.
   (j)    Site Plan Required. A full site plan shall be required for all
proposed cellular communications sites, at a scale of 1 inch to 100 feet ( 1" =
100'), indicating, as a minimum, the following:

street parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, grades,
surfacing materials, drainage plans and illumination of the facility.
      (8)    All existing and proposed sidewalks and open areas on the site.
      (9)    The location of all proposed fences, screening and walls.
      (10)    The location of all existing and proposed streets.
      (11)    All existing and proposed utilities including types and grades.
      (12)    The schedule of any phasing of the project.
      (13)    A written statement by the cellular communications company as to
the visual and aesthetic impacts of the proposed cellular communications tower
on all adjacent residential zoning districts.
      (14)    Any other information as may be required by the Planning
Commission to determine the conformance with this Zoning Code.
   Upon submission of a complete application for site plan review to the
Building Inspector, the application shall be transmitted to the Planning
Commission where it shall review the site plan to determine if it meets the
purpose and requirements as established in this Section, of the zoning district
where the proposed cellular communications site is located and of any other
applicable Section of this Zoning Code.

time, not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days.
(Ord. 00-85. Passed 9-25-00.)
   1349.06 MAINTENANCE.
   Any owner of property used as a cellular communications site shall maintain
such property and all structures in good condition and free from trash, outdoor
storage, weeds and other debris. Any cellular communications tower that has
discontinued its service for a period of twelve (12) continuous months or more
shall be removed, along with all accessory structures related thereto.
Discontinued shall mean that the structure has not been properly maintained,
has been abandoned, become obsolete, unused or has ceased the daily activities
or operations which had occurred. Any owner of property used as a cellular
communications site shall be fully responsible to maintain the lighting of such
structure in good operating condition at all times until such structure is
dismantled to a height of less than 100 feet or completely disassembled
whichever should occur first whether the structure is in service or not.

   1350.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD (DRB).
   (a)   There is hereby established a Design Review Board which shall have the
powers and duties as are hereinafter set forth in this Chapter. The Design
Review Board shall consist of seven members, who shall be appointed by the
Mayor subject to confirmation by Council. Design Review Board members shall be
appointed with due regard for the need to include Preservation District
property owners and professional expertise in the fields of architecture,
engineering, history, archaeology, urban planning, landscape architecture, art
design or other related disciplines. The Design Review board shall consist of
1.) An architect; 2.) a realtor; 3.) a appointed representative of City
Council; 4.) a member of the Amherst Historical Society; and 5.) two
Preservation District property owners. If the City does not have members from
these disciplines, the City can enter into contracts for technical assistance.
   (b)   Members shall be appointed to serve three years, except in the initial
year when two members shall have one-year terms, two members shall have two-
year terms, and three members shall have three year terms. Members shall serve
until their successors have been named and qualified. A majority of the
membership of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and any action or decision
of the Board shall require the support of such a majority of its members.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD (DRB).
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The Mayor shall provide such
staff assistance as is necessary and available. All municipal departments and
agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent
with this Chapter, governing its procedures and transactions, which shall be
subject to approval by Council. The Design Review Board shall meet as required
to carry out the review of applications for Certificates of Appropriateness,
and such other related work as may be accepted through request of Council or
undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be held at least once each month
when there are applications to be considered and not less than once every three
months. Special meetings may be held at the call of the chairperson of the
Design Review Board.
   (c)   The Design Review Board shall review any proposed new construction and
alterations to property within the boundaries of any Preservation District. The
Design Review Board's approval of such new construction or alteration must be
secured before any owner of property may commence work thereon. In reviewing
proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a minimum
use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by the
Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features
substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other
buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)    Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design review
criteria with Council approval based on the Preservation District's predominant
architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/archaeological
attributes.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.05 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS,
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No alteration of any structure or significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a
Certificate of Appropriateness from the Chief Building Inspector and a
Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued by the Chief Building Inspector
that is required as a result of an alteration of a structure in the
Preservation District unless the application for such permit is approved by the
Design Review Board through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.06 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District proposes
new construction or alteration of any portion of a structure within the
Preservation District, the owner shall first apply for (through the Chief
Building Inspector) and secure a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design
Review Board. The application for a Certificate shall be filed with the Chief
Building Inspector, together with such plans, specifications, and other
material as the Design Review Board may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall consider the applications, plans, and
specifications filed with the application for the Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the Preservation District, and does not violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the Design Review Board fails to act on
an application within sixty (60) days of filing, the application shall be
deemed approved.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines that a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be issued, it shall forthwith state in
its records reasons for such determination and may include recommendations
respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition
of any area, place, building, structure, site, object, or work of art. The
Secretary of the Board shall forthwith notify the applicant and the Chief
Building Inspector of such determination and transmit to the applicant a copy
of the reasons for denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)   In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness, applicant
may appeal denial of the decision of the Design Review Board to Council within
thirty (30) days:
      (1)   Council may affirm or reverse the Board's decision. Council shall
decide the appeal within sixty (60) days after the owner has filed a Notice of
Appeal with Council.
         (Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.07 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   The owner of an historic structure or any structure within the Preservation
District shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to
ensure its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration,
whether the building is vacant or inhabited.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this Chapter or the application thereof is held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
Chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application
and to this end the provisions of this Chapter are hereby declared severable.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.09 EXCLUSIONS.
   Normal and ordinary maintenance functions performed on buildings within the
Preservation District and the removal/demolition of declared public nuisances
(e.g. fire damaged buildings) that pose a threat to the health and safety of
the general public shall be excluded from this chapter.
(Ord. 01-34. Passed 4-9-01.)
   1350.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters, changes, or demolishes any
exterior feature of any structure, work of art, object, or area in violation of
this chapter, or whoever maintains, changes, or installs a sign in violation of
this chapter, shall be deemed in violation of the Zoning Code. Each day of
violation shall constitute a separate and distinct violation for as long as one
(1) year with respect to alterations and for as long as two (2) years with
respect to demolition.
