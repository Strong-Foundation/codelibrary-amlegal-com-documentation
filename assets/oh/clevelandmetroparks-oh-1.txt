EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District
Regulations into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an
adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the
Ohio Revised Code, and in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting
a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and
section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the
chapter number is 305 (or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section
number is .06. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with
the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the
chapter number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number appears
right of the decimal. As another example, 101.08 indicates the code number is
1, the chapter number is 101 (or the first chapter within code 1), and the
section number is .08.
    This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    A regulation which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior regulation and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior regulation.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a regulation does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the regulation or any prior action
taken thereunder;

by a re-enactment or amendment of any regulation, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Park District Regulations applies
to all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, divisions, subdivisions or of subsections of a section,
such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, division,
subdivision or subsection included in such reference.
   References in the Park District Regulations to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Park District Regulations include, in every
case, action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision
which is superseded by the Park District Regulations.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If regulations enacted at different meetings are
irreconcilable, the regulation latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same regulation are enacted at different
meetings, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting a regulation, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire regulation is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    A regulation is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If a regulation is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the regulation was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the regulation.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Park District Regulations or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect the other provisions or applications of the section
or related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09 WAIVERS; PERMITS.
   (a)    There are occasions when the waiver of a particular rule is
appropriate or necessary with respect to programs or operations (e.g., allowing
for group functions or special event demonstrations or to accommodate
extraordinary attendance situations) or otherwise. Waivers of particular rules
must be written but may be included in permits, including without limitation
conditions of use (collectively, the "permits"). Inquiries regarding a waiver
of a particular rule should be directed to:
      Cleveland Metroparks
      4101 Fulton Parkway
      Cleveland, Ohio 44144
      (216) 635-3200
   (b)    Whenever a request is made for a waiver of a particular rule by
permit or otherwise, the Chief Executive Officer is authorized to grant the
waivers, including the permits, based on the effect that granting the waiver/
permit may have on maintaining good order; preserving, protecting and
maintaining the vegetation, animals, streams and ponds; safeguarding the park
users and the animals; preventing damage and preserving the environment and
otherwise conserving the natural resources. The Chief Executive Officer may
designate park employees to execute waivers, including permits, under
conditions specified by him. All waivers/permits executed by the Chief
Executive Officer designee shall be deemed to be issued by the authority of the
Chief Executive Officer.
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)    Whenever, in the Park District Regulations, any act is prohibited or
is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever
the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be
unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise provided, whoever violates any
such provision shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) for a first offense; for each subsequent offense such person
shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). A separate offense

Ohio R.C. 4513.63 is left on a roadway, public parking area or upon or within
the right of way of any roadway, or upon any park district land for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer without notification to Police Officer Headquarters

wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.03, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.03 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol
specified in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than
the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a park district
regulation or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of
abuse, or of a park district regulation or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered
a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical control of the
vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing
evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial compliance with
the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field
sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered,

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a roadway

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a roadway or
any property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking
unless the person has a valid license as a motorcycle operator that was issued
upon application by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter
4507. The license shall be in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the
Registrar, upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a
valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the
form of a restricted license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person
does not have a valid license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor
vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial

offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.
         If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent park district
regulation or municipal ordinance.
 
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent park district regulation or municipal ordinance, and if the

specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02. (ORC 4510.12)

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender's name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

to commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Park District for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Park District for an offense committed or completed outside of this Park
District, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Park
District.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Park District
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.005.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
 
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
 
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
 
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   "Intoxication" includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a

501.99 PENALTIES.
   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)    "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
      (2)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
         A.   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
         B.   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to
sentence for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent
sexually oriented offense;
         C.    Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined
in Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one
or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
         D.    Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to
sentence for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent
felony drug abuse offense;
         E.    Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
         F.   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
   (b)   Penalties for Misdemeanors.
      (1)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
         A.   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 that is
substantially similar to a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided by the overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing
are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to
punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall
consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and the need for changing
the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and making restitution to
the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and the public.
         B.   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor
violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of any bylaw or
rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 that is subject to division
(b)(1)A. of this section shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two
overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set forth in division (b)(1)A. of
this section, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the
offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with
sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar offenders.
         C,   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or
for a violation of a bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code
1545.09 that is subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section shall not base the
sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender, or religion of the offender.
         D.   Divisions (b)(1)A. and B. of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1)A. through C. of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Park District for a
violation of its bylaws or rules that are not substantially similar to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
      (2)    Misdemeanor jail terms.
         A.   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. Sections 2929.22 or 2929.23 and,
unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter,
the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
            i.    For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180
days;
            ii.    For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90
days;
            iii.    For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60
days;
            iv.    For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30
days.
   B.   i.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
            ii.   a.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has
filed a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
               b.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
         C.    If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division
(b)(2) of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that
has established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30,
the court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
         D.   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b)
(2) of this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention
facility in which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04,
753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
            i.    The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
               1.    If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
               2.    If the person does not dispute the bill described in
division (2)(d) i.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
            ii.    The sentence automatically includes any certificate of
judgment issued as described in division (b)(2)D.i.2. of this section.
         E.    If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent bylaw or
rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09, also is convicted of or
also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in Ohio R.C.
2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for the
underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised Code or any bylaw
or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09. The offender shall serve
the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail term imposed
for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other mandatory term
imposed in relation to the offense.
      (3)    Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      A.    i.    Except as provided in Ohio R.C. Sections 2929.22 and 2929.23
or when a jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a
misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either
of the following:
               1.    Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
               2.    Impose a jail term under division (b)(2) of this section
from the range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense,
suspend all or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under
a community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
authorized under divisions (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this section.
            ii.    The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon
an offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five
years.
            iii.    At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to
division (b)(3)A.i.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of
the community control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if
any of the conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court
may do any of the following:
               1.    Impose a longer time under the same community control
sanction if the total time under all of the offender's community control
sanctions does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (b)(3)A.ii.
of this section;
               2.    Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
               3.    Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b)(2) of this section.
         B.    i.    If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this section, the court shall place the
offender under the general control and supervision of the court or of a
department of probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes
of reporting to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions
imposed. If the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of
probation has been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in
that jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
            ii.    The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
         C.    i.    If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences
the offender to any community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions authorized under division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this
section, and the offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the
public or private person or entity that supervises or administers the program
or activity that comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to
the sentencing court or to the department of probation or probation officer
with general control and supervision over the offender. If the public or
private person or entity reports the violation to the department of probation
or probation officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to
the sentencing court.
            ii.    If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator a longer time under
the same community control sanction if the total time under all of the
community control sanctions imposed on the violator does not exceed the five-
year limit specified in division (b)(3)A.ii. of this section or may impose on
the violator a more restrictive community control sanction or combination of
community control sanctions, including a jail term. If the court imposes a jail
term upon a violator pursuant to this division, the total time spent in jail
for the misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community
control sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the
offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may
reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under
the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction by all or part of the time
the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.
         D.   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender,
for a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community
control sanction imposed pursuant to division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of this
section in an exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under
the community control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control
sanction. Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not
relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division (b)(6) of
this section.
      (4)    Community residential sanction.
      A.    Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (b)(4). Community
residential sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
            i.    A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
            ii.    A term of up to 180 days in an alternative residential
facility or a term in an alternative residential facility not to exceed the
longest jail term available for the offense, whichever is shorter. The court
may specify the level of security in the alternative residential facility that
is needed for the offender.
         B.    The court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (b)(4) may do either or both of the following:
            i.    Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
            ii.    Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender
may seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive
treatment, perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation
imposed by law or by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be
only for the duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the
release and for travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of
release.
            iii.   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income
earned by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (b)(4)B. of this
section be applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (b)(6) of
this section.
            iv.   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
            v.   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as
described in division (b)(4)A. of this section, at the time of reception and at
other times the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house,
alternative residential facility, or other place at which the offender will
serve the residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in
charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility,
or other place may cause the convicted offender to be examined and tested for
tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to/
hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of
the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or
other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV
infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to/ hepatitis A, B, and C, or
another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
            vi.    The Park District may enter into a contract with a halfway
house for use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a
sanction imposed under division (b)(4)A. i. of this section.
      (5)    Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
         A.   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to/ the following:
            i.    A term of day reporting;
            ii.    A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or
continuous alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous
alcohol monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol
monitoring without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring;
            iii.    A term of community service of up to 500 hours for
misdemeanor of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second,
third, or fourth degree;
            iv.    A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security
for the offender as determined necessary by the court;
            v.    A term of intensive probation supervision;
            vi.    A term of basic probation supervision;
            vii.    A term of monitored time;
            iix.    A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random
drug testing;
            ix.    A curfew term;
            x.    A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
            xi.    A requirement that the offender obtain education or
training;
            xii.    Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the
victim, a requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender
mediation;
            xiii.    If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's
privilege to operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the
offender's motor vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor
vehicle operator's license, or any other related sanction;
            xiv.    A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the
offense is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar bylaw or
rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 or a violation of Ohio R.C.
2903.13 or a substantially similar bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio
Revised Code 1545.09 involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
         B.    In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (b)(5)A.
of this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
         C.    The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose
a term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
      (6)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         i.   Restitution.  
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
   4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
            ii.    Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (b)
(6)A.ii.1. and 2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required
by law:
               1.    A fine in the following amount:
                  a.    For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
                  b.    For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
                  c.    For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00);
                  d.    For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than
two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
                  e.    For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00);
                  f.    For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
               2.    A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
            iii.    Reimbursement.
               1.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs
of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
                  a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
                  b.    All or part of the costs of confinement in a jailor
other residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for
room and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               2.    The amount of reimbursement under division (b)(6)A.iii.1.
of this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender
is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
         B.   i.    If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court
may hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the
financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (b)(6) or court costs or
is likely in the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
            ii.    If the court determines that the offender is indigent and
unable to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider
imposing and may impose a term of community service under division (b)(5)A. of
this section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the
court does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a
term of community service under division (b)(5)A. of this section in lieu of or
in addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (b)(6) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (b)(5)C. of this section in lieu of or
in addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition
to imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
         C.   i.    The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (b)(6)A.iii. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (b)(4),
(5), or (6) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (b)(4) of this section
to the County Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements
in the County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the
fund to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed
under division (b)(4), (5), or (6 of this section or in operating a facility
used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (b)(4)
of this section.
            ii.    The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (b)(6)A.iii. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a park district pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (b)
(4), (5), or (6) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (b)(4) of this section
to the Treasurer of the park district. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the park district's General Fund. The park district shall use
the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the park
district pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of
this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (b)(4) of this section.
            iii.    The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (b)(6)A.iii. of this section for the costs incurred by a private
provider pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (b)(4), (5), or (6) of
this section to the provider.
         D.    i.    Except as otherwise provided in this division (b)(6)D., a
financial sanction imposed under division (b)(6)A. of this section is a
judgment in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the
court that imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the
financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of
reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (b)(6)A.iii.1.a. of this section
upon an offender is a judgment in favor of the entity administering the
community control sanction. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (b)(6)A.iii.1.b. of this section upon an offender confined
in a jailor other residential facility is a judgment in favor of the entity
operating the jailor other residential facility. A financial sanction of
restitution imposed pursuant to division (b)(6)A.1. of this section is an order
in favor of the victim of the offender's criminal act that can be collected
through execution as described in division (b)(6)D.ii.1. of this section or
through an order as described in division (b)(6)D.ii.2. of this section and the
offender shall be considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment
debtor.
            ii.    Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political
subdivision may bring an action to do any of the following:
               1.    Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1)(a) to (e) or a substantially equivalent bylaw or rule adopted
pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09.
               2.    Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the
judgment debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially similar bylaw or
rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09.
         E.   The civil remedies authorized under division (b)(6)D. of this
section for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not
preclude, enforcement of the criminal sentence.
         F.   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (b)(6) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
            i.    Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or
private vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before
entering into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender
pursuant to any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (b)(6), a
court shall comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
            ii.    Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
            iii.    To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to
an offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
         G.   No financial sanction imposed under this division (b)(6) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
   (c)   Imposing Sentence for Misdemeanor.
      (1)    A.   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by
Ohio R.C. 1547.99(G), 451O.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code
1545.09, a court that imposes a sentence under this chapter upon an offender
for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion to determine the most
effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in
Ohio R.C. 1545.99(B).
      B.   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is precluded
from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the penalty for
an offense or by any provision of Sections 2929.23 to 2929.28 of the Ohio
Revised Code, a court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions
under Ohio R.C. 1545.99 (B) (2) to (6). The court shall not impose a sentence
that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government resources.
      C.    i.   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
               1.    The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
               2.    Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the
offense or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent
criminal activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a
substantial risk that the offender will commit another offense;
               3.    Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the
offense or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and
condition reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to
others and that the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to
the consequences;
               4.    Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other
factor made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the im
pact of the offense more serious;
               5.    Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (c)(1)C.i.2.
and 3. of this section.
            ii.   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (c)(1)C.i. of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Division (b) (1) of this section.
            iii.   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor,
a court shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control
sanction or a combination of community control sanctions under Ohio Revised
Code Section 1545.99 (B) (3), (4), (5), and (6). A court may impose the longest
jail term authorized under Ohio R.C. Section 1545.99 (B)(2) only upon offenders
who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and
response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition
of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender from committing a
future crime.
            iv.   1.   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or
written statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or
the prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
               2.   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as
possible after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of
the victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
   (d)   Organizational Penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Ohio Revised Code
Section 1545.99 (B), an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 1545.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         A.    For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00);
         B.    For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four
thousand dollars ($4,000.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
         F.    For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         G.   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Ohio
Revised Code Section 2901.23, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine
imposed pursuant to this section.
   (e)   Multiple Sentences.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (e)(2) of this section, Ohio R.C.
2929.14(E), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E) a prison term, jail term, or
sentence of imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison
term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this park
district, the State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in
division (e)(2)(b) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for
misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of
imprisonment for felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
      (2)   A.   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor
shall be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence
of imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
         B.   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14,4510.16,4510.21, or 4511.19, or a substantially
similar bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09, shall be
served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of
Ohio R.C. 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio
R.C. 2903.04 involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and
that is served in a State correctional institution when the trial court
specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or
sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more
misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
   (f)   Suspension of Driver's License. Except as otherwise provided in Ohio
R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision of the Revised Code, whenever an
offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of a
bylaw or rule adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 that is
substantially similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is
permitted or required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of any bylaw or rule
adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of any bylaw or rule
adopted pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 1545.09 is substantially similar.

unrestrained activity of dangerous, nuisance, and vicious dogs which threaten
the safety and pleasantness of parkways, parks, sidewalks, trails, and all

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.19 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.19, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
