EDITOR'S NOTE
 
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in

indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the

INTRODUCTION
   Possibly it did not take much to persuade William Waite, of Cuyahoga County,
New York, to purchase 629 acres of the western half of the plateau between the
branches of the Chagrin River. It was prime land for farming -- fine, fertile
soil, abundant water from gushing springs, wood for building houses, cooking
and heating. His deed was dated November 20, 1820, and the price was $1,572.80.
Thus the first recorded valuation of land in what was to become Waite Hill
Village was $2.50 per acre.
   Over the next two years the entire Waite clan, which consisted of William,
his two sons and two daughters and all of their spouses, moved here to settle
the land. At first it was dangerous, and there were years of drudgery, but they
made this into a prosperous farming area which lasted several generations. The
names Waite and Otis (William's son-in-law) were still much in evidence when
things began to change at the turn of the century.
   With improved transportation, prominent Clevelanders noticed the pleasing
scenery and began to look to the east for sites for their summer and year-
around homes. one such was John Sherwin. Deeds dated July 10, l907, show he
bought 105 acres from Eliza Waite, George Waite, et al., and there were similar
purchases over the next several years. Friends joined Mr. Sherwin, and it was
the foresight of these men which made Waite Hill the unique place it is today.
They decided that interests would best be served if the community became
established as a legal entity. Waite Hill was incorporated as a village at an
election by Kirtland Township trustees on June 16, 1928. There are familiar
names among the first Village officials who were elected July 14: Edward Bruch,
Dan Hanna, John Sherwin, Charles Otis, Warren King, Mrs. John Sherwin, Wilson
Hobart, Walter Metcalf, John Sherwin, Jr. and John Newell, Jr.
   It is interesting to note the matters of concern at the first Council
Meeting, held August 7, 1928, as evidenced by the legislation:
    1.    An ordinance designating public places for the posting of ordinances.
    2.    An ordinance prohibiting trespassing on private property.
    3.    An ordinance regulating traffic.
    4.    An ordinance to prevent the destruction of private property.
    5.    An ordinance appointing a Deputy Marshal.
    6.    An ordinance applying for funds from Kirtland and Willoughby
Townships.
    7.    An ordinance establishing a Planning Commission.
   At the next Council Meeting they decided to hire a full time policeman, at a
salary of $110 per month.
   Organization as a Village was an important step forward. Police protection
remains one of our primary concerns today, as do land use, financing and
planning. We now have another major opportunity to gain greater control over
our own affairs. This Charter, if adopted, will go far toward long term
solutions to these problems, and toward maintaining the integrity, beauty,
character and independence of Waite Hill Village.

August 19, 1985
CHARTER
OF
WAITE HILL, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of Waite Hill, In order to exercise the fullest measure of
municipal home rule and local self government and to preserve, protect and

rural character of the Village for the benefit of its citizens and those of
surrounding communities, it is the intent of the people of Waite Hill to
restrict commercial development and to maintain low density housing.

   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23; Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
    (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
 
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52; Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
       (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49; Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50; Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (a)    Any news medium organization that desires to be given advance
notification of special meetings of a Municipal body shall file with the Clerk
a written request therefor. Except in the event of an emergency requiring

   (b)    News media requests for such advance notification of special meetings

it is filed or until the Clerk receives written notice from such medium
canceling or modifying such request, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this
chapter each year shall be divided into two six-month periods, the first to run
from January 1 until June 30, the second to run from July 1 to December 31.
Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a complete new request
with the Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made unless it is complete
in all respects, and such request may be conclusively relied on by the Village,
the Municipal body that is the subject of such request and the Clerk.
   (d)    The Clerk shall give such oral notification or written notification
or both, as the Clerk determines, to the news media that have filed such
requests, of the time, place and purposes of each special meeting, at least
twenty-four hours prior to the time of such special meeting.
   (e)    In the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action, a
special meeting may be held without giving twenty-four hours advance
notification thereof to the requesting news media. The persons calling such
meeting, or any one or more of such persons or the Clerk on their behalf, shall
immediately give oral notification or written notification or both, as the
person or persons giving such notification determine, of the time, place and

   Each such written request shall be accompanied by a payment of five dollars
($5.00) for each Municipal body from which notice is being requested, which sum
Council has determined is a reasonable fee to cover costs of such advance
notification for a six-month period as set forth in Section
107.04(c). Such requests may be modified or extended beyond the six-month
period only by filing a complete new request with the Clerk. A request shall
not be deemed to be made unless it is complete in all respects, and such
request may be conclusively relied on by the Village, the Municipal body that
is the subject of such request and the Clerk.
   (b)    The Clerk shall provide advance notification for each six-month
period of meetings for which notice has been requested to each person who has
made a proper request as provided in subsection (a) hereof. Whenever it is
practica1 to do so, such advance notification shall be by written notification.
Such written notification shall include a copy of the agenda for the meeting.
Where time does not permit the sending of written notification, the Clerk shall
give oral notification. (Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
107.06 GENERAL.

purpose of any then known special meetings; and whether the available agenda of
any such future meeting states that any specific type of public business,
identified by such person, is to be discussed at such meeting.
   (b)    Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may be
given by any person acting in behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk.
   (c)   A reasonable attempt at notification shall constitute notification in
compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
107.07 NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (a)    The failure of any Village official or employee or any Municipal body
to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not invalidate any action
taken not in compliance with this chapter.

to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not subject such official
or employee or Municipal body to either civil or criminal liability on account
of such failure.
(Ord. 1987-4. Passed 3-9-87.)
107.08 PUBLIC MEETINGS OF MUNICIPAL BODIES.
   (a)    All meetings of any Municipal body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times.
   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such Municipal body shall
be promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only
reflect the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions
authorized under subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)    The members of a Municipal body may hold an executive session only
after a majority of a quorum of the Municipal body determines, by a roll call
vote, to hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting for the
sole purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)    To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no Municipal body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office. If a Municipal body holds an
executive session pursuant to this subsection (b)(1), the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
purposes listed in this subsection (b)(1) are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a Municipal body shall use this subsection as a
subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A
purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the
public property has received covert information from a member of a Municipal
body that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for
other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   If the minutes of the Municipal body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the Municipal body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instruments executed by the Municipal body purporting to convey,
lease or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned;
      (3)    Conferences with an attorney for the Municipal body concerning
disputes involving the Municipal body that are the subject of pending or
imminent court action;
      (4)    Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)    Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules
or state statutes;
      (6)    Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   If a Municipal body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in subsections (b)(2) through (6) hereof, the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
matters listed in those subsections are to be considered at the executive
session.
   (c)    All resolutions, rules or formal actions of any kind shall be adopted
in open meetings of Municipal bodies.
(Ord. 1988-20. Passed 9-2-88.)
107.09 VIRTUAL MEETINGS AND REMOTE ATTENDANCE.
   (a)   As used in this section “Hearing” means an administrative hearing, at
which a person may present written or oral testimony on a matter before the
municipal body.
   (b)   At the discretion of the chair of the municipal body, members of a
municipal body may hold and attend meetings and may conduct and attend hearings
by means of teleconference, video conference, or any other similar electronic
technology and the following shall apply:
      (1)   Any resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind shall have the
same effect as if it had occurred during an open meeting or hearing of the
municipal body.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (C) of section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised
Code, members of a municipal body who attend meetings or hearings by means of
teleconference, video conference, or any other similar electronic technology,
shall be considered “present” as if in person at the meeting or hearing, shall
be permitted to vote, and shall be counted for purposes of determining whether
a quorum is present at the meeting or hearing.
      (3)   Public bodies shall provide notification of meetings and hearings
held under this section to the public, to the media that have requested
notification of a meeting, and to the parties required to be notified of a
hearing, at least twenty-four hours in advance of the meeting or hearing by
reasonable methods by which any person may determine the time, location, and
the manner by which the meeting or hearing will be conducted, except in the
event of an emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an
emergency, the municipal body shall immediately notify the news media that have
requested notification, or the parties required to be notified of a hearing of
the time, place, and purpose of the meeting or hearing.
      (4)   The municipal body shall provide the public access to a meeting
held under this section, and to any hearing held under this section that the
public would otherwise be entitled to attend, commensurate with the method in
which the meeting or hearing is being conducted, including, but not limited to,
examples such as live-streaming by means of the internet, local radio,
television, cable, or public access channels, call in information for a
teleconference, or by means of any other similar electronic technology. The
municipal body shall ensure that the public can observe and hear the
discussions and deliberations of all the members of the municipal body, whether
the member is participating in person or electronically.
      (5)   When members of a municipal body conduct a hearing by means of
teleconference, video conference, or any other similar electronic technology,
the municipal body must establish a means, through the use of electronic
equipment that is widely available to the general public, to converse with
witnesses, and to receive documentary testimony and physical evidence.
      (6)   The authority granted in this section applies notwithstanding to
any conflicting provision of the Ohio Revised Code.

current appropriations, for any public improvement, or the purchase or lease of
equipment, materials and supplies, or to obtain professional or personal
services or for any other lawful purpose. The Mayor shall notify Council of
such expenditure at the next meeting of Council.
   (g)    Mayor's Conditional Spending Authority. The Mayor may make an
expenditure which is between twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), upon the prior approval of four members of
Council, which approval may be made in writing or by a motion and vote at any
regular or special meeting of Council. Authorization provided by Council in
writing shall only be effective if not fewer than five members of Council are
provided with a written explanation of the amount and purpose of the proposed
expenditure, and the reason for the necessity of action prior to the next
meeting of Council. Further, all written authorizations for such expenditures
shall be announced at the next regular or special meeting of Council by the
Mayor, including a report of which members of Council were notified in writing
and the reason that immediate action was necessary.
   (h)    Real Estate. The Mayor may purchase, sell or lease real property
valued below twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), provided that a current
appropriation supports any such purchase or lease of real estate and provided
that Council is notified of such purchase, sale or lease at the time of the
next Council meeting (including any work session). The Council may, by
ordinance, provide for the purchase, sale or lease of real property, valued at
or in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), with or without public
bidding, on such terms and for such value as Council, in the exercise of its
discretion, may deem reasonable and in the best interest of the Village.

no minimum time requirement between the publishing of the notice of public
bidding and the opening of the bids.
   (j)    Estimate of Cost. The Village shall disclose the estimated cost of
the project when it determines that doing so is in its best interest.
   (k)    Time for Award of Bids. In the notice of public bidding required for
the bid solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit for awarding a
contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this period. The Village's
failure to award and execute the contract within this period invalidates the
entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time for awarding and
executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the Village and the
bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with respect to whom the Village
subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension shall not
entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (l)   Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant Section 9.31 of
the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the Village's right
to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (m)    Bids in Excess of Estimate. The Village may award contracts
regardless of the value of the bid as compared to the value of the estimated
cost.
   (n)    Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to
proceed with the work by the Village or its representative upon execution of
the contract. The Village shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time
that it determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract
for its convenience.
   (o)    Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
contractor at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage
shall not be held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such
times and in such amounts as the Village determines to be equitable.
   (p)    General Contractor Permitted. The Village may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
   (q)    Extension of Bid Opening. The Village may issue an addendum or
addenda modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for
the bid opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued
within forty-eight hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be
extended by at least three days.
   (r)    Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The Village at its
discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (s)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a bonus
for completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different. (Ord. 2025-9. Passed 5-12-

Contract will equal or exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), the

terms in this Section
137.02, or elsewhere in Chapter
137, and not otherwise defined in this Section or Chapter shall have the
following meanings:
       (1)    "Eligible Investment" means any investment described in
subsection (l) hereof.
      (2)    "Investment Advisor" means a person or entity which the Council
has determined has the experience and training to provide advice and
recommendations in regard to overall portfolio investment strategy as well as
individual investments of Village funds with whom the Village has contracted in
writing to provide such advice and such recommendations.
      (3)    “Public Moneys” means all moneys in the treasury of the Village or

      (5)   "Uniform Depository Act " means Chapter 135 of the Ohio Revised

   (b)    Scope. All Public Moneys of the Village on deposit with an Eligible
Depository (as defined in Section
137.08 hereof), except as otherwise hereinafter provided, may be invested, or
if already invested may be reinvested, by the Clerk-Treasurer or such
official's designee, or by the Village's Investment Advisor upon approval of
the Clerk-Treasurer or such official's designee, in the Eligible Investments
described in subsection (l) hereof; provided, however, that subject to the
provisions of Article VIII, Section 6, Ohio Constitution, Public Moneys:
      (1)     Held by a trustee or escrow agent under a trust agreement, trust
indenture or escrow agreement between the Village and such trustee or escrow
agent in connection with, or related to, an issue of bonds, notes or other
obligations of the Village may be invested in any investments permitted by such
trust agreement, trust indenture or escrow agreement or as are approved by the
rating agency or rating agencies rating such bonds, notes or other obligations;
or
      (2)    Specifically exempted by separate ordinance from this Section
137.02, may be invested as permitted in such ordinance.
   The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to pool cash balances of the several funds
of the Village for investment hereunder.
   (c)    Objectives. The achievement of sound fiscal management for the
Village requires effective investment of the Public Moneys of the Village. To
that effect, the following investment objectives which shall all be of equal
priority shall be applied in the investment of Public Moneys of the Village,
with the achievement of each such objective being measured against the
investment portfolio as a whole and not against an individual Eligible
Investment:
      (1)    Safety. It shall be an objective of this investment policy to seek
to preserve the investment principal of the Village's investment portfolio by
avoiding, to the extent possible while attempting to achieve the other objects
of this policy, capital losses, whether they be from securities' defaults or
erosion of market value.
      (2)    Liquidity. It shall be an objective of this investment policy that
the Village's investments shall be sufficiently liquid to enable the Village to
meet its operating requirements that might reasonably be anticipated.
      (3)    Yield. It shall be an objective of this investment policy to
strive to attain a market-average rate of return (as evidenced by the yield on
a benchmark index acceptable to the Clerk-Treasurer and the Finance Committee)
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the Village's
investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (d)    Minimizing Investment Risk.
      (1)    The Village acknowledges that investment risk can result from:
         A.    A default by the issuer of the investment,
         B.    Changes in the market price of the investment, or
         C.    Technical complications leading to temporary loss of liquidity
of an investment.
      (2)    To minimize the effect of such investment risks the following
investment limitations shall be adhered to except as otherwise may be approved
by the Finance Committee of Council either at a meeting or by telephone,
confirmed at the next meeting of the Finance Committee, a written record of
which approval shall be maintained by the Clerk-Treasurer:
         A.    No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Village's Public
Moneys shall at any given time be invested in any single issue of a security
authorized under subsection (l)(2) hereof.
         B.    With respect to investment of the Village's Public Moneys in the
Eligible Investments authorized in subsection (l)(10) hereof.
            1.    No more than five percent (5%) of the Village's invested
Public Moneys shall at any given time be invested in such an Eligible
Investment of a single issuer, and
            2.    No more than sixty-five percent (65%) of the Village's
invested Public Moneys shall at any given time be invested in Eligible
Investments authorized under subsection (l)(10) hereof. (Ord. 2000-6. Passed 4-
10-00.)
         C.    1.   Except as provided in subsection
137.02(c)(2)C.3. below, unless the maturity of an Eligible Investment is
limited in subsection (l) hereof to a period of time less than ten (10) years,
in which case the maximum maturity of such Eligible Investment shall be as set
forth in subsection (l) hereof, each Eligible Investment made pursuant to this
Section
137.02 shall have a maturity not exceeding ten (10) years from the date of
settlement of the Eligible Investment.
            2.   The weighted average maturity of all Eligible Investments
(exclusive of any investment in the Ohio Subdivisions Fund created pursuant to
Section 135.45 of the Ohio Revised Code) shall not exceed seven (7) years.
            3.   The maturity of any security issued by any federal government
agency or instrumentality, which is an Eligible Investment pursuant to Section
137.02(l)(2) hereof, may exceed ten (10) years, and shall not be used in the
calculation of the weighted average maturity identified in subsection
137.02(c)(2)C.2. above.
               (Ord. 2007-13. Passed 10-8-07.)
   (e)    Sale Prior to Maturity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in subsections (c) or (d) hereof shall be construed to
prohibit the Clerk-Treasurer, such official's designee or the Village's
Investment Advisor if acting with the approval of the Clerk-Treasurer or such
official's designee from selling any Eligible Investment prior to its maturity,
or to impose liability on the Clerk-Treasurer, such official's designee or the
Village's Investment Advisor if acting with such approval for any loss
occasioned by the sale of any Eligible Investment made at a price lower than
its cost or book value, if either:
      (1)    The liquidity needs of the Village required such a sale; or
      (2)    The yield on the reinvestment of the sale proceeds of such
Eligible Investment, after taking into account the loss incurred in connection
with such sale, will exceed the yield that the Village otherwise would have
earned if it had held the original Eligible Investment to the earlier of:
         A.    Its maturity date; or
         B.    The maturity date of the Eligible Investment purchased with such
sale proceeds.
   (f)   Standard of Care. Investment of the Public Moneys of the Village shall
be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, that persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived. The foregoing standard
shall be applied to the investment portfolio of the Village as a whole.
   (g)    Authority to Invest Public Moneys. The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby
authorized and directed to invest the Public Moneys of the Village in
accordance with the provisions of this Section
137.02. The Clerk-Treasurer may delegate the authority to invest the Public
Moneys of the Village hereunder to another employee or employees of the
Village, provided that any such delegation shall be in a writing that shall be
filed with the Finance Committee of Council, and such a delegation shall not be
effective for all purposes of this Section
137.02 unless and until the Finance Committee approves such a delegation. Such
a delegation may be for a limited or unlimited period of time; provided that,
if such delegation is for an unlimited period of time:
      (1)    Revocation of such delegation shall be effective only if made in a
writing instrument signed by the Clerk-Treasurer and
      (2)    Termination of the employment by the Village of such employee
shall automatically terminate such employee's authority to invest the Public
Moneys of the Village hereunder without the need for a written instrument.
   If the Village engages an Investment Advisor to assist it with the
investment of its Public Moneys, and has given such Investment Advisor
authority to execute the purchase and/or sale of Eligible Investments on behalf
of the Village, the Investment Advisor may purchase or sell any Eligible
Investment of the Village without the prior approval of the Clerk-Treasurer or
such official's designee only if such Investment Advisor is so authorized in
its contract with the Village or is otherwise so authorized in writing by the
Mayor; otherwise, the Investment Advisor shall obtain the approval of the
Clerk-Treasurer or such official's designee prior to the purchase and/or sale
of Eligible Investments on behalf of the Village. In addition, each Investment
Advisor engaged by the Village shall be sent a copy of Chapter
137 of the Village's Codified Ordinances, as amended by this section, and such
Investment Advisor shall agree in writing to comply with the provisions of the
same.
   (h)    Conflicts of Interest. Officers and employees of the Village involved
in making investment decisions shall refrain from:
       (1)    Personal business activity that could conflict with the proper
execution and management of the investment program of the Village, or that
could impair their ability to make impartial decisions regarding the Village's
investments, and
       (2)    Undertaking personal investment transactions with the same
individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the Village unless the
investment transactions conducted by such individual on behalf of the Village
are conducted through an informal competitive bidding procedure.
   (i)    Periodic Reports with Respect to Eligible Investments. The Clerk-
Treasurer shall prepare or cause to be prepared an investment report no less
frequently than at the end of each calendar quarter, which shall be a public
record available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Unless the Finance Committee of Council or the Clerk-Treasurer agree otherwise,
such report shall include: a list of all Eligible Investments that were part of
the Village's investment portfolio at any time during that calendar quarter,
with the following information on each Eligible Investment:
      (1)    A description of the obligation or security that includes the
type, original cost, amortized premium, accreted discount, par value, maturity
date, coupon interest rate and yield to maturity;
      (2)    All purchases, sales and maturities of Eligible Investments during
that calendar quarter;
      (3)    All income and profits accrued or realized and/or losses realized
during such period;
      (4)    The market price of each Eligible Investment as of the beginning
and end of such period, or if an Eligible Investment was sold prior to the end
of such period, the sale price of such Eligible Investment; and
      (5)    The weighted average annualized yield on the Village's investment
portfolio for that calendar quarter compared to the annualized yield from the
benchmark index as described in subsection (c)(3) hereof.
   If the Village has engaged an Investment Advisor, the report described in
this subsection (i) hereof may be prepared by such Investment Advisor and, in
such an event, shall be delivered to the Clerk-Treasurer within a reasonable
time after the end of each calendar quarter.
   (j)    Authorized Purchasers from and Sellers to the Village of Eligible
Investments. In the case that the purchase of Eligible Investments is made
directly by the Clerk-Treasurer or such official's designee, and not through
its Investment Advisor, from an Eligible Depository or Qualified Securities
Dealer that initiates the sale of an investment to the Village, then such
purchase of Eligible Investments hereunder shall be made only from an Eligible
Depository or a Qualified Securities Dealer, as the case may be, which has
acknowledged to the Village in writing that it has received a copy of Chapter
137 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village, and it will not sell to or for
the account of the Village any investment security not expressly authorized
hereunder as an Eligible Investment.
   (k)    Purchases and Sales of Eligible Investments by the Village.
      (1)    The Village or its Investment Advisor on its behalf:
         A.    Shall purchase an Eligible Investment hereunder for cash at a
price not in excess of the current market price, which price shall be deemed to
be the best price as determined hereunder, and
         B.    Shall sell an Eligible Investment for cash and for a sum not
less than its current market price, which price shall be deemed to be the best
price as determined hereunder.
      (2)    A.    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (l)(5) hereof
with respect to an overnight repurchase agreement, all purchases and sales of
Eligible Investments hereunder shall be made only on a delivery versus payment
basis. With respect to the purchase or sale of any Eligible Investment other
than the Eligible Investments described in subsections (l)(8) and (9) hereof,
the Clerk-Treasurer, such Clerk-Treasurer's designee or the Village's
Investment Advisor, subject to the provisions of subsection (j) hereof and
except as otherwise provided in this subsection shall sell any Eligible
Investment at the best price based upon at least two bids from any of the
parties described in subsection (j) hereof.
         B.    As used in subpart (2)(A) hereof:
            1.    In connection with any purchase of an Eligible Investment,
the "best price" shall mean that price which produces the highest yield to
maturity in the discretion of the Investment Advisor or the Clerk-Treasurer
with respect to such Eligible Investment; and
            2.    In connection with the sale of an Eligible Investment, the
"best price" shall mean the highest price with respect to such Eligible
Investment based upon at least two bids obtained at the time of the sale;
provided, however, that in any case where there are two or more bids at the
best price, the Clerk-Treasurer, such Clerk-Treasurer's designee or the
Village's Investment Advisor may, in their absolute discretion, determine which
of such bids constitutes the best price.
      (3)    The Clerk-Treasurer, the Clerk-Treasurer's designee or the
Village's Investment Advisor shall keep a written record of the bids taken with
respect to each sale of an Eligible Investment.

below in subsection (b)(2)A. hereof. Interest earned on any investments held by
the Qualified Trustee shall be collected by the Clerk-Treasurer and credited by
the Clerk-Treasurer to the proper fund of the Village; provided, however, that

   (a)    Due to the nature of the job as police officer of the Village of
Waite Hill, it is necessary that all members of the Department be in excellent
health. If a member of the Police Department is injured or has a health problem
that requires medical leave, it shall be mandatory that this member be

and effects of the medication. The prescribing physician shall also be required
to certify to the Village that the prescription taken as directed will not
interfere with the performance of the duties of the officer taking the
prescription. It shall be determined by the Mayor and Chief of Police if this
medication will affect the officer's performance of his job and if the officer

policy may result in suspension or dismissal. (Ord. 1998-8. Passed 2-9-98.)

by PERS or PFDPF to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and
shall be paid by the Village to PERS or PFDPF on behalf of that employee as a
pick-up and in lieu of a PERS or PFDPF employee contribution otherwise payable
by that employee.
   (d)    Such employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total
salary less the amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable,
subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (1)     The Village shall compute and remit its employer contributions to
PERS or PFDPF based upon an employee's total salary. The total combined
expenditures of the Village for such employee's total salaries payable under
applicable Village policies and the pick-up provisions of this section shall
not be greater than the amounts the employee would have been paid for those
items had this provision not been in effect.
      (2)    A person electing this pick-up deduction shall not have the option
of choosing to receive the payroll deduction directly instead of having this
deduction picked up by the Village. Members who have elected to participate in
this plan cannot increase, decrease, or terminate the amount of the pick-up
deduction.
   (e)    All full-time Village employees identified in subsection (b) hereof
and who are contributing members of PERS or PFDPF may purchase additional
service credit, tax-deferred, and the Village shall withhold the required
service credit deduction from the gross pay of each person who elects to do so
and shall pick up (assume and pay) such deduction to PERS or PFDPF in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof. This provision shall be effective March
1, 2000.
   (f)    The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized to perform all acts
necessary and appropriate to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of
this section, including; but not limited to, making applications to the
Internal Revenue Service for private letter rulings concerning federal tax
treatment of the provisions of this plan and making applications to the
appropriate state retirement boards.
      (Ord. 2000-5. Passed 2-14-00.)
145.02 OHIO DEFERRED COMPENSATION PROGRAM.
   (a)    The Village, by this Council, hereby adopts a plan under the Ohio
Public Employees Deferred Compensation Program and extends to all eligible
employees the opportunity to join such Plan.
   (b)    The Mayor is hereby authorized and directed to execute an agreement
with the Ohio Public Employees Deferred Compensation Board on terms and
conditions which the Mayor determines are in the best interest of the Village
and its employees, which agreement shall authorize the Board to offer a plan
under the Program to all eligible employees of the Village, and thereafter to
administer the plan on behalf of such employees.
(Ord. 1986-19. Passed 8-11-86.)
145.03 DRUG TESTING OF PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.
    (a)    Declaration of Policy: Purpose and Background.
      (1)    In balancing the interest of the Village, its residents, its
employees, and the health, safety and general welfare of the public, the
Council finds that fair and equitable testing for drugs in the workplace, in
accordance with the terms of this section, and the laws of the State of Ohio,
the Constitution of this State, and the Constitution of the United States, is
in the best interest of all parties.
      (2)    A healthy and productive work force and safe working conditions
free from the affects of drugs are of importance to the Village, its residents,
its employees, and the general public. All have an interest in a safe and
productive work environment, in preserving the quality of the services rendered
and in maintaining a favorable reputation of the Village. The abuse of drugs
creates a host of workplace problems including increased injuries on the job,
increased absenteeism, increased financial drain on Village programs and funds,
increased workplace theft, and decreased employee morale. The public has an
interest in safety in the workplace and in the quality of services rendered in
the Village. The public also has an interest in controlling and reducing the
crime rate, both in and out of the workplace. Further, the public has an
interest in the continued ability of the Village to provide services to its
residents. The misuse of drugs poses a threat to these important goals.
      (3)    The challenge, therefore, is to establish fair and legal criteria
for detecting, identifying, verifying and responding to drug abuse within the
Village work force.
   (b)    Prohibited Conduct.
      (1)    Use of controlled substances. The Village shall not hire for
employment individuals who demonstrate that they are illegally using, or have
illegally used recently within the time of their application for employment,
controlled substances, as defined by the criminal laws of the State of Ohio, to
the extent that such use would impair employee job performance or tend to bring
the Village, or an agency of the Village into disrepute, or constitute conduct
unbecoming the employee's position. In no event shall a prospective employee
continue to use controlled substances, either on duty or off duty, during the
term of employment with the Village.
      (2)    Sale or distribution of controlled substances. Employees of the
Village are prohibited from engaging in conduct, either on or off duty,
amounting to the illegal distribution of controlled substances as defined by
the criminal law of the State of Ohio.
      (3)    Testing authorization. The Council hereby authorizes the testing
of individuals seeking employment with the Village in an effort to verify
compliance with the terms of this section. Council further empowers the Chief
of the Village Police Department to designate appropriate test facilities,
techniques and appropriate procedures in order to implement the terms of this
section in conformance with the laws of the State of Ohio, the Constitution of
this State, and the Constitution of the United States. The Chief of Police
shall establish reasonable safeguards for preserving the confidentiality of the
test results, subject to the requirements of Ohio R.C. 149.43 and Chapter 1347,
if applicable, and any such test results are the sole property of the Village.
The Village is entitled to use test results as a basis for action as defined
under subsection (b)(5) hereof. In order to effectively test for presence of
drugs, the Village may require biological specimens ("samples") from
prospective employees and may require presentation of reliable identification
to the person collecting the same. Selection of the type of sample is at the
sole discretion of the Chief of the Village Police Department.
      (4)    Preemployment testing. All candidates for employment with the
Village or any of its departments, on and after the effective date of this
section, are hereby required to undergo to the testing authorized in subsection
(b)(3) hereof.
      (5)    Sanctions.
         A.    Failure to successfully complete testing authorized herein shall
automatically disqualify a candidate for appointment to the position for which
such testing was performed. A positive test for drugs, however, shall not
operate in and of itself, as a bar to consideration for employment, but may be
considered in evaluating a candidate for employment.
         B.    Upon receipt of a positive drug test for any candidate for
employment, the hiring authority shall review the test results, including the
type of drug used, in light of the job functions of the candidate. After
review, if the hiring authority determines that the candidate's former drug use
will affect job performance detrimentally, such that the candidate's drug use
will negatively affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the Village, the candidate shall be denied consideration for
employment with the Village.
         C.    If the hiring authority determines that the candidate's former
drug use will not affect job performance as indicated above, then the candidate
may be further considered for employment. If a candidate who has tested
positive for controlled substances is hired for employment with the Village,
the candidate shall be required to attend a drug abuse counseling/
rehabilitation program approved by the hiring authority, at the employee's or
candidate's expense, until such time as the candidate demonstrates that he/she
is no longer subject to the use or influence of controlled substances. Failure
to attend or comply with the requirements of the treatment/counseling program
shall constitute a failure to obey a lawful and reasonable direction given by a
superior and will subject an employee to disciplinary action.
      (6)    Severability. If any part or provision of this section is held to
be invalid under or repugnant to the laws of the State of Ohio, the
Constitution of this State, or the Constitution of the United States, the
remainder of this section shall not be affected and shall continue in full
force and effect.
         (Ord. 1989-6. Passed 5-8-89.)
145.04 HEALTH, DENTAL, MEDICAL AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE, LIFE
INSURANCE COVERAGE, ANND HEALTH SAVINGS ACOUNT BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into agreements
with one or more insurance companies, duly designated by motion of Council, for
health, medical, dental and prescription drug insurance coverage and life
insurance coverage for the employees of the Village, including a high
deductible health plan (“Plan”). Copies of such agreements are on file in the
office of the Clerk-Treasurer of the Village.
   (b)   (1)   In conjunction with the implementation of the Plan, the Mayor is
hereby authorized to establish a Health Savings Account program in conformance
with any and all requirements under applicable laws, which will permit eligible
employees of the Village to contribute pre-tax dollars to a Health Savings
Account. The Mayor is authorized to enter into an agreement or agreements with
a third party administrator and other necessary parties, duly designated by
motion of Council, as may be necessary to create, maintain, and administer the
Health Savings Account program, upon terms and conditions acceptable to the
Mayor. Employees participating in the Health Savings Account program are
responsible for ensuring that contributions to a Health Savings Account do not
exceed the maximum annual contribution limit required by laws. The Village is
not responsible for any penalties, taxes, or expenses associated with any
contribution to a Health Savings Account exceeding a maximum annual
contribution limit and shall have the right to seek indemnification from
noncompliant employees or any third parties as the Mayor deems appropriate.
Employees are encouraged to review their Health Savings Account balances on a
regular basis and to consult with their Health Savings Account administrator
during the last quarter of each calendar year in order to avoid any potential
penalties.
      (2)   In calendar year 2009, the first year of the implementation of the
Plan, the Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to contribute up to two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) to the Health Savings Account of each full-time
employee enrolled in the Plan. Such contribution shall be made by the Village
though monthly installments in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) with
an additional one hundred dollar ($100.00) contribution in the month of
January, provided, however, the Clerk-Treasurer shall, upon written
notification that an employee’s Health Savings Account meets or exceeds the
annual contribution limits established by laws, cease monthly contributions to
such employee’s Health Savings Account. The Clerk- Treasurer, upon the written
approval of the Mayor, may accelerate the Village’s contribution for any
employee that has incurred qualified medical expenses in excess of the amount
contributed to the Health Savings Account at the time the expenses are
incurred. This acceleration option is available throughout calendar year 2009
to all eligible employees. The Mayor is authorized to promulgate rules and
regulations necessary to ensure the implementation of the acceleration program
on an equal and uniform basis.
         (Ord. 2009-2. Passed 1-12-09.)
      (3)   In calendar year 2015 and each year thereafter, the Clerk-Treasurer
is authorized to match the contribution made by each employee enrolled in the
plan to his or her Health Savings Account, up to one thousand six hundred
dollars ($1,600.00) annually, provided, however, the Clerk-Treasurer shall,
upon written notification that an employee’s Health Savings Account meets or
exceeds the annual contribution limits established by laws, cease match
contributions to such employee’s Health Savings Account. Employee’s
contributions to the Health Savings Account must be through a payroll deduction
in order to be eligible for the Village match contribution. The Council may
increase that match contribution by motion of Council.
         (Ord. 2015-15. Passed 10-12-15.)
      (4)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to adopt new or amend any existing
benefits plan documents of the Village, including the Village’s cafeteria plan,
that are necessary to ensure that the Health Savings Account program complies
with all applicable laws.
(Ord. 2009-2. Passed 1-12-09.)
145.05 EMPLOYEE PROTECTION AGAINST HIV AND AIDS.
    The Mayor is hereby authorized and directed to adopt a policy for the
protection of the Village's employees to help guard against the accidental
contraction of the AIDS virus, HIV, in the work place. This policy shall be
kept on file in the Clerk's office and may be amended from time to time as
needed.
(Ord. 1993-2. Passed 2-8-93.)
   POLICY AND PROCEDURE
   Protection Against HIV & AIDS Viruses
   The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency

persons shall be handled as if they are HIV carriers.
   B.    Extreme care shall be taken during a search of a suspect to prevent
accidental skin punctures from needles concealed on the suspects person.
   C.    When it becomes necessary to handle any person who has blood or body

should be worn if time permits to utilize them.
   D.    The officer shall always use disposable gloves when handling any
person.
      1.    Disposable latex gloves shall be kept on the officer's person at
all times, while he is on duty, by the use of a nylon pouch worn on the
officer's Sam Brown belt.
IV.    Disinfection Procedures.
   A.    Disinfection procedures shall be used whenever a police vehicle has

possible after the subject has been removed from the vehicle.
   B.    Protective gloves, eye protection and mask shall be worn during
decontamination.
   C.    Excess blood and body fluid shall be removed with disposable absorbent

the incident and, without delay, contact the Chief of Police.
145.06 VACATION LEAVE.
   (a)    Each full-time employee of the Village, who has been employed by the
Village full time for a period of twelve (12) months continuous service, shall
have earned and will be due upon the attainment of the anniversary of the
first-year of employment, forty (40) hours of vacation leave with full pay.
   (b)    Each full-time employee of the Village, who has been employed by the
Village full time for a period of twenty-four (24) months continuous service,
shall have earned and will be due upon the attainment of the anniversary of the
second year of employment and annually thereafter, eighty (80) hours of
vacation leave with full pay.
   (c)    Each full-time employee of the Village, who has been employed by the

have earned and will be due upon the attainment of the anniversary of the fifth
year of employment, and annually thereafter, one hundred twenty (120) hours of
vacation leave with full pay.
   (d)    Each full-time employee of the Village who has been employed by the
Village full time for a period of one hundred eighty (180) months continuous
service, shall have earned and will be due upon the attainment of the
anniversary of the fifteenth year of employment and annually thereafter, one
hundred sixty (160) hours of vacation leave with full pay.
(Ord. 1993-4. Passed 4-12-93.)
   (e)    Village employees shall forfeit their right to take vacation leave to
their credit which is in excess of the accrual of eighty (80) hours. Such
excess shall be eliminated from the employees leave balance. (Ord. 2014-9.
Passed 8-11-14.)
   (f)    If a Village employee desires to take more than one hundred sixty
(160) hours vacation leave in any two (2) month period, approval of the
employee's supervisor and the Mayor shall first be obtained.
(Ord. 1993-4. Passed 4-12-93.)
145.07 SICK LEAVE.
   Sick leave is granted to full-time employees of the Village, subject to the
following requirements:
   (a)   Sick Leave. Subsequent to the first year of service, and in any twelve
(12) month period thereafter, a full-time employee may use up to six (6) weeks
of paid sick leave and another six (6) weeks of unpaid sick leave.
   (b)   Use of Sick Leave.
      (1)   Sick leave may be used by a full-time employee only to attend to an
employee’s illness or injury and the employee shall document with the Village
the illness or injury necessitating such leave with a report from the
employee’s medical professional.
      (2)   Sick leave may be taken on an intermittent basis or as part of a
reduced work schedule, with the approval of the employee’s supervisor, so as to
cause the least disruption to the performance of work.
      (3)   Employees may not perform work for themselves or another employer
while away on or otherwise using sick leave.
      (4)   Unpaid sick leave shall be used contemporaneously with any other
paid leave that is due the employee (e.g. compensatory time, vacation leave or
holiday leave).
   (c)   Job Protection. Upon return from sick leave, the full-time employee
shall be reinstated to the same or equivalent position, with the same pay,
benefits, and terms and conditions of employment. Nothing herein shall be
construed as prohibiting Village from employing a replacement to fulfill an
employee’s responsibilities while the employee is on sick leave. Employees
returning from sick leave shall be required to provide a fitness for duty
certification from their healthcare provider.
   (d)   Rights After Exhaustion of Sick Leave. Full-time employees who are
unable to return to work, and have exhausted their available sick leave and all
other leaves granted by the Village, shall have no job protection, right to
reinstatement, or any other benefits that are available to Village employees
unless otherwise required by law. (Ord. 2015-1. Passed 1-12-15.)
145.08 DISCIPLINARY POLICY.
    (a)    Declaration of Policy.
      (1)    It is the policy of the Village of Waite Hill to treat its
employees fairly and equally, and to base all decisions regarding discipline
upon the facts and circumstances which are pertinent to an individual case. The
purpose of the progressive discipline outlined in this section is to make the
disciplinary action commensurate with the nature and severity of any improper
conduct by an employee.
      (2)    Whenever work habits, attitude, production, infraction of
regulations or personal conduct of any employee fall below a reasonably
desirable standard, supervisors should orally notify the employee at the time
the infraction is observed. A written reprimand, with sufficient time for
improvement, should precede further punitive discipline whenever possible, but
nothing herein shall prevent or shall be deemed to prevent immediate
disciplinary action when the interests of the Village or the protection of the
public require it.
   (b)    Investigation. Prior to any disciplinary action more severe than an
oral reprimand, the department head shall cause the investigation of any
incident, event or infraction of rules involving or committed by an employee in
his department. The findings of the investigation shall be recorded in writing
and reported to the Mayor. This report shall be deemed to be the work product
of an ongoing internal investigation and shall not be subject to public
disclosure pursuant to Ohio's Public Records laws. The right for the
investigating authority to keep such work product private shall be held solely
by the employee being investigated.
   (c)    Disciplinary Action.
      (1)    Reprimand. For the good order and discipline of the department, a
department head may cause an employee to be reprimanded. There shall be two
types of reprimands: oral and written.
         A.    Oral Reprimand. Whenever work habits, attitude, production or
personal conduct of any employee fall below a desirable standard, the
department head should point out the deficiencies at the time they are
observed. Oral reprimands should be used for minor rule infractions, provided
such infractions are not chronic for the employee involved.
         B.    Written Reprimand. Whenever an employee fails to respond to the
oral reprimand of a supervisor, or an event occurs which, in the department
head's discretion, warrants discipline more severe than an oral reprimand, the
department head may discipline the employee via a written reprimand. The
department head shall document the nature of the employee's conduct as part of
the written reprimand, and shall deliver to the employee a copy of the written
reprimand, place a copy in the employee's personnel file, and deliver a copy of
the written reprimand to the Mayor. The employee shall acknowledge receipt of a
copy of the reprimand, and may place written comments or objections thereto in
his personnel file and/or deliver them to the Mayor. Written reprimands shall
become a permanent part of an employee's personnel file.
      (2)    Suspension. Suspensions are of two types: disciplinary and
nondisciplinary.
         A.    Disciplinary Suspension. In the interest of good discipline,
upon the recommendation of the department head or at the Mayor's discretion,
the Mayor may, for just and reasonable cause, suspend an employee without pay
for a period not exceeding thirty (30) working days for any one (1) offense. A
department head may suspend an employee, for the good order of the department,
for not more than three (3) days. An employee under suspension will not be
permitted to exchange suspension time for vacation time or be entitled to sick
leave during the period of suspension. Suspension time shall not be used in
determining seniority. Disciplinary suspensions may be appealed as provided by
law and shall become a permanent part of an employee's personnel file.
           B.    Nondisciplinary Suspension. During investigation, hearing or
trial of an employee for any civil or criminal charge, when suspension would be
in the best interest of the Village, an employee may be suspended by the Mayor
for the duration of the proceedings. Council shall exercise discretion whether
or not the non-disciplinary suspension shall be with or without pay, provided
that if the grounds for the non-disciplinary suspension are resolved in favor
of the employee, the employee shall be entitled to the full recovery of salary,
benefits and seniority lost during the suspension.
      (3)    Demotion. Demotions consist of two kinds: disciplinary and
voluntary. Demotions are a method of disciplining an employee for an offense
that does not warrant outright dismissal. They are also used in order that an
employee whose work has been satisfactory but who does not deserve outright
dismissal may be retained and given an opportunity to perform less difficult
work. Demotions may also be on a voluntary basis when requested by an employee.
         A.    Disciplinary Demotion. Upon the request of a department head, or
at the Mayor's discretion, the Mayor may demote an employee for disciplinary
purposes when the actions of the employee do not justify dismissal, or where
the work of an employee has not been satisfactory, he may demote the employee
to less difficult work. Salaries and wages of employees demoted will be
adjusted to those of the lower classification. No demotion may be made as a
disciplinary action unless the employee to be demoted is eligible and qualified
for reemployment in a lower classification, and a demotion may not be made if
any regular full-time employee in the lower classification would be laid off by
reason of such action. Any order of disciplinary demotion may be appealed as
provided under law, and shall become a permanent part of an employee's
personnel file.
         B.    Voluntary Demotion. An employee may request or accept voluntary
demotion when assignment to less difficult or responsible work would be to his
advantage and to the best interest of the service. Salaries and wages of
employees demoted will be adjusted to those of the lower classification. Such
demotion may not be granted if it causes the lay-off or demotion of a regular,
full-time employee. Voluntary demotion may also occur in the event of the
elimination of a job in a higher classification, when the employee chooses to
accept a job offered to him in the Village with a lower classification. There
is no appeal of a voluntary demotion.
      (4)    Terminations.
   Dismissal. An employee may be dismissed for dishonesty, drunkenness,
recklessness on the job, inefficiency, habitual tardiness, misconduct,
attitudes which constitute an unwholesome influence on other employees,
unwillingness to perform adequate quality or quantity of work, failure to obey
any reasonable order, the use of abusive language toward his superior,
conviction of criminal acts, fraudulently obtaining sick or injury leave, or
any other action or conduct that materially affects or impairs the efficiency
of the Village's service or brings the Village into public disrepute. Upon the
request of a department head, or at the Mayor's discretion, the Mayor may
dismiss any employee at any time for any of the above causes. However, no
dismissal shall be made for political, religious or any unlawful reason. A
department head requesting the Mayor to dismiss an employee shall, at the time
of making such request, make a detailed report in writing containing all the
pertinent facts in connection with the cause for the requested dismissal. The
Mayor, before dismissing the employee, may make or cause to be made such
additional investigation as he deems necessary to verify the facts and shall
give the employee a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the reasons for
dismissal. An employee has the right to appeal an order of dismissal as
prescribed by law.
   (d)    Resignation. An employee resigning his position shall, whenever
possible, give sufficient advance notice of his intention to enable the Village
to make proper provisions for the filling of his position. All resignations
shall be in writing and shall include the date the employee plans to leave,
together with the reasons therefor.
   An employee whose date of separation falls between regular established pay
dates will be paid on the first regular pay day of his department following the
date of his separation. Under extreme circumstances, or if the employee is
leaving the Village permanently, immediately following his separation, he may
appeal to the Mayor for an earlier payment of his wages.

145.12 COMPENSATORY TIME.
   (a)    Policy. This Village hereby adopts a policy of providing all
nonexempt employees with compensatory time off in lieu of overtime, subject to
a maximum accumulation of sixty (60) hours of compensatory time off.
   (b)    Compensatory Time. Where an employee would be entitled to overtime
pay pursuant to departmental policy or law, said person may elect to receive
compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half hours for each overtime
hour worked. Any overtime worked in excess of the maximum accumulation of sixty
(60) hours compensatory time shall be paid as overtime.
   (c)    Use of Compensatory Time. Employees shall be permitted to carry their
compensatory time off from one year to the next, but each department may
promulgate reasonable rules designed to insure that compensatory time off is
used by the employee without undue accumulation. Specifically, each department
of the Village may, if it is deemed in the best interest of the Department,
require employees to exhaust compensatory time off prior to using vacation
leave. (Ord. 2014-7. Passed 6-9-14.)
145.13 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   The Village of Waite Hill will promote the principles of Equal Employment
Opportunity in all decisions involving recruiting, hiring, training,
compensation, benefits, promotions, and transfers and in the administration of
all other human resources actions. All employment decisions will be made on the
basis of each individual employee's qualifications, skill, ability, experience,
and other factors which make each employee a valued asset of the Village. The
Village of Waite Hill is committed to a policy against unlawful employment
discrimination or harassment on the basis of an individual's race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other
characteristic protected by law.
(Ord. 2004-13. Passed 12-13-04.)
145.14 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Policy. It is the policy of the Village of Waite Hill that all
employees should be able to enjoy a work environment free from all forms of
discrimination, including sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of
misconduct that undermines the integrity of the employment relationship. No
employee, either male or female, should be subjected to unsolicited and
unwelcome sexual overtures or conduct, either verbal or physical. Sexual
harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable
nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, that is personally
offensive, that lowers morale and that, therefore, interferes with employee
effectiveness. Specifically, no person shall threaten or insinuate, either
explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual
advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation, wages,
advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or any other condition of employment or
career development.
   (b)    Education Procedure. Each supervisor has a responsibility to maintain
the workplace free of sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this
policy with all employees and assuring them that they are not to endure
insulting, degrading or exploitive sexual treatment.
       (1)    Upon the effective date hereof, each supervisor shall distribute
a copy of this policy to each employee in his or her department and obtain a
written acknowledgment of receipt, which shall be placed in that employee's
personnel file.
      (2)    Each new hire shall receive a copy of this policy and sign a
written acknowledgment of receipt which shall be placed in the employee's
personnel file.
   (c)    Complaint Procedure. An employee who believes he or she is the
subject of sexual harassment shall report the same as follows:
      (1)    An employee should report the alleged charge immediately to his/
her immediate supervisor.
      (2)    If the alleged charge involves the employee's immediate
supervisor, then the employee should immediately report the incident to his/her
Department Head.
      (3)    If the alleged charge involves the employee's Department Head then
the employee should immediately report the incident to the Mayor.
      (4)    Complaints involving the Mayor shall be directed to the President
of Council.
      (5)    The persons receiving the complaint shall immediately advise the
Law Director, who shall thoroughly investigate the complaint.
   (d)    Confidentiality. Complaints of sexual harassment will be handled
confidentially, to the extent possible.
   (e)    Disciplinary Action. Meritorious allegations of sexual harassment
will result in severe disciplinary action against the person or persons
responsible therefor, up to and including termination. Knowingly false
accusations will result in severe disciplinary action against the accuser, up
to and including termination.
(Ord. 2004-13. Passed 12-13-04.)
145.15 LONGEVITY COMPENSATION.
   Each full-time officer and employee who has been in the continuous service

addition to his or her base salary in accordance with the following
schedule:
         After 5 years of continuous service - 3%

each member of the Police Department, the Village, at its expense, shall
provide for his or her use, winter and summer police uniforms consisting of
coat, outer coat, trousers, belt, holster, shirt, tie, cap, badge, firearm,
shoes, winter boots, and such other items necessary to the performance of the
officer's duties, as approved by the Mayor upon the recommendation of the

    (a)   All full-time employees of the Village shall be entitled to eighty
(80) hours of holiday leave per calendar year, which shall be permitted leave
from work for days that would have otherwise been scheduled work days. Said
holiday leave may be scheduled at any time during the calendar year subject to
approval by the Department Head. When applicable to maintain the efficient
operation of the Village, employee seniority shall be utilized.
   (b)   Holiday leave shall be taken annually and shall not carry over in to
the following calendar year.
   (c)   New employees or employees who terminate their employment for any
reason shall be entitled to holiday leave on a pro-rata basis for each full

screening findings. In the case of satisfactory substance abuse test results,
time spent in order to travel to the sampling facility, time spent providing a
satisfactory test sample pursuant to the insistence of the Village and
thereafter time spent returning to work shall be deemed time spent at work. A
refusal or failure to provide a substance abuse test sample or the providing of
an unsatisfactory substance abuse test result, regardless of the grounds on
which a substance abuse test is sought, shall not be considered time spent in
the service of the Village because an employee shall be deemed medically
unqualified for duty in such cases. An employee requesting a confirming
substance abuse test shall be considered to be doing so on the employee's own
time. (Ord. 1996-4. Passed 2-12-96.)
147.02 SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY, PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, AND RULE MAKING
AUTHORITY.
   (a)    Policy. It is the Village's policy to provide safe, dependable and
efficient government services to the public. Village employees are a valuable
and important resource and it is therefore the Village's policy to provide a
healthy, safe, and satisfying working environment for its employees as well as
to staff that working environment only with employees who are fit to duty.
Federal laws and regulations have been adopted which require the Village to
implement a drug, controlled substance, and alcohol screening program for
operators of a commercial motor vehicle and for employees who engage in certain
safety sensitive occupations. Accordingly, a requirement for entering Village
employment, retaining Village employment, or advancing in the administrative
service of the Village into positions to which the abovementioned Federal
regulations apply shall henceforth be that such an employee is fit for duty in
the additional sense that he or she is free of drug dependence, not a user of
nor a trafficker in controlled substances or drugs, and free of alcohol
dependency or use such that his or her normal mental or physical capabilities
are not impaired. In meeting these goals, it is further the Village's policy
to:
       (1)    Assure that covered employees operating a covered vehicle with or
without a commercial driver's license are fit for duty and able to perform
their assigned duties in a safe, productive, healthy, and unimpaired manner.
      (2)    Create a workplace free from the adverse effects of drug, alcohol,
and substance abuse.
      (3)    Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances, among persons
entrusted with covered vehicles or persons employed by the Village by contract
to engage in work involving the operation of a covered vehicle.
   (b)    Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure that covered
employees who operate covered vehicles are fit for duty; to eliminate, if
possible, the risk to the Village posed by the use of alcohol, drugs, and
controlled substances by covered employees while operating covered vehicles;
and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol abuse, controlled substance use or
drug abuse. It is further the Village's purpose to detect, identify and remove
from duty those covered employees who operate covered vehicles when such
employees should not be operating a covered vehicle because they are not fit
for duty. However, it is not the purpose of this policy to warrant or to
guarantee to the public at large or other employees of the Village who are
injured by a covered employee that the Village has detected or will in every
instance detect that a violation of this policy has occurred before some
injurious result occurs, and it is not the purpose of this policy to create an
express or implied warranty on the part of the Village to the public at large
or other employees that all covered employees are free from alcohol abuse, drug
misuse, or controlled substance use.
   (c)    Applicability. This chapter shall apply to covered employees when
going to or from work, when going to a work site, when preparing to perform
work at a site, when performing work for the Village, when on a break or at
lunch while in the course of performing work, after concluding the performance
of work at a site but before departing the work site, when returning to the
Village facilities following departure from a work site, and when on Village
property regardless of work status.
   (d)    Rulemaking Authority. The Mayor or the Mayor's designee is hereby
authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as well as create forms,
documents, and procedures for the implementation of this chapter. Such
activities as are undertaken under authority of this subsection shall be
consistent with this chapter and consistent with the relevant Federal laws and
regulations governing substance abuse testing as the same are applicable to the
Village.
(Ord. 1996-4. Passed 2-12-96.)
147.03 SUBSTANCE FOR WHICH TEST IS TO BE CONDUCTED.
   Tests shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for
alcohol, any controlled substance or drug as said terms are defined herein and
whose misuse or abuse is addressed in this chapter.
(Ord. 1996-4. Passed 2-12-96.)
147.04 GROUNDS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING.
   All covered employees shall be subject to substance abuse testing of either
urine, breath, and/or blood under the following circumstances:
    (a)    Pre-employment or Pre-promotion Testing. All applicants who are
selected for appointment or promotion to a position whose incumbent would be a
covered employee shall be notified by the Clerk-Treasurer upon that selection
that a test for drug, alcohol and controlled substance use must precede their
appointment or promotion into covered employment. An applicant who is
tentatively selected for appointment or promotion by the appointing authority
and who then refuses, declines, or fails to submit to a drug, alcohol and
controlled substance test upon notice to do so by the Clerk-Treasurer shall be
deemed to be medically unqualified for covered employment and shall not be
appointed or promoted into covered employment. An applicant, who is selected
for appointment or promotion and is tested for drug, alcohol and controlled
substance use prior to appointment or promotion to covered employment, must
receive a satisfactory test result before beginning employment in the new
position.
   (b)    Reasonable Suspicion Testing. Covered employees shall be subject to a
fitness for duty evaluation, which shall include appropriate urine, blood, and/
or breath testing when a supervisor has reasonable suspicion that controlled
substance use, drug abuse or alcohol use is adversely affecting a covered
employee's performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing shall be
made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are
consistent with the long or short-term effects of substance abuse. "Reasonable
suspicion" means an apparent state of existing facts, circumstances or
information which result from any inquiry by the supervisor or from a credible
source which would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to
reasonably believe the covered employee is under the influence of or using
controlled substances, drugs, or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion determinations
leading to a substance abuse test shall be made by a covered employee's
supervisor who shall be reasonably trained in the detection of the signs and
symptoms of substance abuse or who is reasonably familiar with the same, and
who reasonably concludes that a covered employee's work, mental faculties, or
physical capabilities are presently being impaired or affected by substance
abuse.
      (1)    Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         A.    Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on
the job behavior for unexplained reasons;
         B.    Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
         C.    Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited
substances;
         D.    Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.    Fights (to mean physical contact), assault, menacing, stalking,
or threatening behavior, and flagrant disregard or violation of established
safety, security or other operating procedures.
      (2)    Reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a covered
employee's possession of alcohol, particularly unopened containers of alcohol
or possession of alcohol by trained medical personnel for purposes of medical
treatment. Possession of alcohol with observations concerning the employee's
appearance, speech, or abnormal conduct are necessary. Possession of a
controlled substance shall be reasonable suspicion for requiring a controlled
substance test. Possession of drugs shall not be grounds for a reasonable
suspicion test if the covered employee can:
         A.    Satisfactorily explain to his or her supervisor the reasons for
possession of the drug;
         B.    Identify the physician who prescribed the drug for the covered
employee (this information can be verified to the supervisor by the pharmacy
filling the prescription or the prescribing physician); and
         C.    The use of drugs has not affected or impaired the employee's
work performance.
The fact that satisfactory explanation is provided shall not negate reasonable
suspicion if the covered employee's mental or physical abilities appear to be
affected or impaired by the drug.
      (3)    Observations leading to a reasonable suspicion substance abuse
test shall be reduced to writing or otherwise preserved within a reasonable
time by the supervisor making the decision to require such a test.
      (4)    Once a covered employee has been notified that a reasonable
suspicion test will be conducted, the test shall take place within two hours of
this notice. If the test is not conducted within two hours, a written record
shall be made stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If
the test has not been conducted within eight hours following the notification,
no test shall be administered and a record shall be made of why the test was
not administered with eight hours.
   (c)    Post-Accident Testing. A covered employee (as well as any employee
operating a covered vehicle despite not having a commercial driver's license)
shall be subject to urine, blood or breath testing when a covered vehicle is
involved in a collision or when control over a covered vehicle is unexplainably
(for non-mechanical reasons) lost. By way of illustration, but not limitation,
an unexplained loss of control of a covered vehicle or a collision between a
covered vehicle and a person that results in a fatality or injuries requiring
medical attention; a collision between a covered vehicle and another vehicle or
train resulting in material damage, a collision between a covered vehicle and a
stationary or moving object resulting in material damage shall be grounds for a
post accident substance abuse test.
   Material damage for purposes of this subsection means damage estimated to be
equal to or greater than four hundred dollars ($400.00). The determination of
whether material damage has occurred shall be made by a supervisor other than
one who was within the covered vehicle when the triggering event occurred or
witnessed that event.
   The filing of criminal or traffic charges as a result of a triggering event
shall not be necessary to require a covered employee or a noncovered employee
operating a covered vehicle to submit to a postaccident test. Reasonable
suspicion that the operator of a covered vehicle involved in a triggering event
has used drugs, alcohol or controlled substances is immaterial to the
requirement herein of a postaccident test.
   Post-accident testing shall not be permitted to delay the administration of
necessary medical attention to injured covered employees. Once a covered
employee has been notified that a post accident test will be conducted, it
shall take place within two hours of this notice. If the test is not conducted
within two hours, a written record shall be made stating the reasons the test
was not promptly administered. If the test has not been conducted within eight
hours following the notification, no test shall be administered and a record
shall be made of why the test was not administered within eight hours.
   Covered employees or noncovered employees, who operate a covered vehicle
that is involved in an accident resulting in material damage or in an
unexplained loss of control and who are so seriously injured that a substance
abuse test cannot be obtained within the requisite two hour period shall
execute a medical consent form allowing an analysis of any adequate substitute
bodily fluids taken within two hours of the triggering event for the purposes
of medical treatment to be used for analysis for the purpose of substance abuse
testing (assuming scientifically reliable results can be obtained). Failure to
grant such consent when fluids capable of analysis exist shall cause the
employee to be deemed medically unqualified for duty such that a substance
abuse test is required before the covered employee may return to work.
   The Village may, but shall not be required to, substitute, accept and rely
upon the result of any blood, urine, or breath test conducted pursuant to
Ohio's implied consent statute as an accurate and reliable substance abuse test
for purposes of this chapter provided the test is an accurate and reliable
means for testing for alcohol, drug and controlled substance abuse.
   A covered employee or a noncovered employee who operates a covered vehicle
involved in an accident, unless injured so seriously that immediate medical
attention is required, must make his or her whereabouts known to his immediate
supervisor for purposes of remaining available for a possible substance abuse
test for the balance of the work day or eight hours after the accident,
whichever is later. A covered employee subject to test hereunder who cannot be
located following an accident for the balance of the work day or for eight
hours after the accident shall be deemed medically unqualified for duty and
shall not be permitted to return to work until he or she submits to a substance
abuse test.
   (d)    Random and Unannounced Testing. Covered employees shall be subjected
to random, unannounced urine, blood and/or breath testing for the purpose of
detecting substance abuse. The process used for selection of a covered employee
(s) to take a substance abuse test shall be determined by the Village,
provided, however, that the selection process must yield a random result so
that no predictable pattern of identifying the covered employee to be tested
will exist, and provided further, that random testing shall be conducted on an
intermittent schedule so that predictable time frames when tests will be
administered cannot be ascertained.
   A covered employee randomly selected for an unannounced substance abuse test
shall immediately proceed to the designated sampling location to provide a test
sample. A covered employee who refuses or fails to travel to the collection
site or who refuses or fails to provide a test sample for substance abuse test
analysis within a reasonable time after being randomly selected for test shall
be deemed medically unqualified for employment and shall be relieved of duty
without pay until a sample is provided. Covered employees selected for testing
who are not at work when selected shall be passed over if they have been tested
within the previous three hundred and sixty-five days, and otherwise shall be
instructed to report testing immediately upon their return to work.
   The number of random unannounced substance abuse tests conducted annually
may be determined in accordance with the rules of the consortium which the
Village has entered into.
   (e)    Return-to-Duty Testing. All covered employees who previously received
an unsatisfactory result on a substance abuse test, including any second or
confirming test if one was conducted, must undergo return-to-duty substance
abuse testing before returning to work and be evaluated, and treated if
necessary, for substance abuse, and be released to duty by a competent medical
practitioner before returning to work. Covered employees who are subject to
return-to-duty testing shall also be subject to six or more random and
unannounced substance abuse tests, to be conducted when the covered employee is
at work, during the first twelve months following his or her re-entry into
employment separate and apart from their exposure to random and unannounced
testing. A successful return-to-duty test for alcohol shall be a result of 0.02
or less. A negative screen for drugs and controlled substances shall be
considered a successful test for return-to-duty purposes.
   (f)    Employee Requested Testing. Any employee who questions the results of
a substance abuse test required or administered pursuant to subsections (a)
through (e) hereof may request that a confirming test in addition to any
initial test be performed. This test may be conducted by the same or a
different testing facility, provided the facility is certified by DHHS to meet
29 CFR Part 40 requirements. If possible, the testing shall be conducted with
the same specimen (on a split sample if such exists) that was originally
submitted to the testing Village's laboratory. All costs for testing requested
by an employee are to be paid for by the employee. (Ord. 1996-4. Passed 2-12-
96.)
147.05 SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING PROCEDURES AND DISCLOSURE.
   If, the Village of Waite Hill has entered into a consortium of communities
to conduct the appropriate testing, the tests shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of that consortium. (Ord. 1996-4. Passed 2-12-96.)
147.06 EFFECTS OF REFUSAL OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE TEST SAMPLE AND UNSATISFACTORY
RESULT.
   (a)    Any covered employee who is subject to a substance abuse test under
this chapter and who is informed, orally or in writing, to submit to a
substance abuse test shall provide a sample adequate for initial and conforming
substance abuse testing. Samples which are provided in an acceptable fashion
and to an appropriate container at the testing facility, which sample(s) are
then lost, lost by breakage, misplaced, mislabeled, mishandled, or contaminated
by the testing facility or its employees so as to be scientifically unreliable
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a sample.
   (b)    Refusal or failure to provide a sample adequate for initial and
confirming testing within a reasonable time, or the refusal or failure of a
covered employee who is notified to provide a substance abuse test sample to
immediately appear for testing, shall cause the covered employee to be deemed
medically unfit for duty and to be relieved of duty without pay.
   (c)    If a substance abuse test indicates the presence of controlled
substances, drugs, or an impermissible level of alcohol in the covered
employee's system, the employee shall be deemed medically unfit for duty, he or
she shall be relieved of duty, and he or she shall be subject to disciplinary
action.
   (d)    No covered employee shall be permitted to perform safety-sensitive
function or engage in the operation of a vehicle whose operation requires a
CDL:
       (1)    When test results indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater;
      (2)    Within four hours after using alcohol;
      (3)    While using alcohol on the job;
      (4)    During the eight hours following an accident if the covered
employee's involvement has not been discounted as a contributing factor in the
accident or until the covered employee is tested for substance abuse and
achieves a satisfactory result; or
      (5)    If the covered employee refuses to submit to required substance

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

   303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.

on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a

death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor

impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has
safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any
recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or elf-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                               $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

determine, and that the use of a transaction scan device does not excuse a
seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

for juveniles.

serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to

1105.02 PLAT PROCEDURES.
   Without exception, the following procedure shall be followed in detail in
order to obtain approval of the final plat:
   (a)    Pre-application Procedure.
      (1)     Previous to the filing of an application for conditional approval
of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may, if he so desires, submit to the
Planning Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting, plans and data as
specified in Section
1105.05. This step does not require formal application, fee or filing of the
plat with the Commission.
      (2)    At the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission shall
inform the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or
do not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the Commission finds the
plans and data do not meet the objectives of these regulations it shall express
its reasons therefor.
   (b)    Conditional Approval of Preliminary Plat.
      (1)    On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in subsection
(a) hereof, regarding the subdivider's general program and objectives, the
subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with
improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in Section
1105.05.
      (2)    Five copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting
with written application for conditional approval at least ten days prior to
the meeting at which it is to be considered.
      (3)    Following:
         A.    Review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted for
conformity thereof to these regulations and review of the preliminary plat by
the Lake County Sanitary Engineer and the Lake County Board of Health for their
approval;
         B.    Negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and
the kind and extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider;
            and
         C.    Review and approval of the preliminary plat by the Engineer.
The Commission shall, at or before the second subsequent regularly scheduled
meeting, act thereon as submitted, or modified, and if approved, the Commission
shall express its approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of
such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its disapproval and its
reasons therefor.
      (4)    The action of the Commission shall be noted on two copies of the
preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the
Commission.
      (5)    Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat (subdivision plat). Rather, it shall be deemed an
expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a
guide to the preparation of the final plat which shall be submitted for
approval of the Commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the
requirements of these regulations and any conditions of the conditional
approval.
   (c)    Approval of Final Plat.
      (1)    The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat
as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which it is proposed to record and
develop at the time, provided, however that such portion conforms to all
requirements of these regulations.
      (2)    The final plat and written application for approval thereof shall
be submitted to the Commission at least ten days before being acted upon.
      (3)    Five copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for
approval shall be prepared as specified in Section
1105.05 and shall be submitted to the Commission at a regularly scheduled
meeting within twelve months after approval of the preliminary plat: otherwise
such approval shall become null and void unless an extension of time is applied
for and granted by the Commission.
      (4)    At least ten days prior to presentation of the final plat for
approval, complete detail construction plans and estimates of cost as required
in Section
1105.05(c)(2) shall be presented to the Engineer for review and approval.
      (5)    After being acted upon by the Commission, a recommendation for
approval or disapproval shall be forwarded to Council. Council at a regularly
scheduled meeting shall then approve or disapprove the recommendation of the
Commission.
      (6)    If the action by Council is for approval of the final plat, the
developer shall then deliver to the Engineer the items required in Section
1105.06, together with evidence of title. If everything is satisfactory, the
Village Solicitor and the Clerk of Council shall sign the final plat and it may
then be recorded.
      (7)    A copy of the final plat as recorded shall be filed with the
Engineer.
      (8)    Final "as built plans" shall be filed with the Engineer.
         (Ord.1967-18. Passed 5-8-67.)
1105.03 PLATTING CRITERIA.
   All of the following conditions, as well as pertinent zoning regulations
shall govern the preparation of all plans and data required by these
regulations:
   (a)    Streets.
      (1)    The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of all
streets shall conform to the Master Road and Land Use Plans, and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical
conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation
to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
      (2)    Where such is not shown in the Master Road and Land Use Plans, the
arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
         A.    Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
         B.    Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by
the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or
other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impracticable.
       (3)    Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic shall be discouraged.
      (4)    Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (5)    Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be permitted
only where their control is definitely placed in the Village under conditions
approved by the Commission.
      (6)    Intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided.
      (7)    Wherever possible, a tangent at least fifty feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all streets.
      (8)    All horizontal deflections in the alignment of streets shall be
connected by a circular curve as follows:
 
Total Deflection Angle Minimum Centerline Radius (feet)
0° to 30° incl.      250
On arterial or collector streets, or under certain other special conditions, a
greater radius may be required by the Commission.
      (9)    Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than
seventy-five degrees (75°).
      (10)    Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of twenty feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission may deem it
necessary. The Commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of
rounded corners.
      (11)    Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the Master Road
and Land Use Plans and where not shown therein shall be not less than as
follows:
 
Street Type     Minimum Right-of-Way (feet)
Collector       70
Minor           60
Marginal Access 40
      (12)    Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations; and where the Commission finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted and dedicated within
such tract.
      (13)    Unless otherwise specifically authorized, permanent dead-end
streets shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed
end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty
feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, with turnout
radii of fifty feet.
      (14)    No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets in the Village. Street names shall be
subject to the approval of the Commission.
   (b)    Easements.
      (1)    Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall
be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be ten feet wide or more,
depending on the proposed usage.
      (2)    Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
channel, storm conduit or stream there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such water
course and such further width or construction, or both, as shall be adequate
for the purpose. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith.
   (c)    Blocks.
      (1)    The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
         A.    Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated;
         B.    Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions;
         C.    Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic; and
         D.    Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (d)    Lots.
      (1)    The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum
building setback lines shall conform to the Zoning Ordinance of the Village for
the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
      (2)    Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
      (3)    Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided
except where essential to provide separation of residential development from
traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet, and across which
there shall be no right-of-access, shall be provided along the line of lots
abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
   (e)    Public Sites and Open Spaces.
      (1)    Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use
shown in the Master Road and Land Use Plans is located in whole or in part in a
subdivision, the Commission may require the dedication of such area, or such
use of the area, within the subdivision in those cases in which the Commission
deems such requirements to be reasonable.

improvements until acceptance of such improvement by the Village. The local
bank or savings and loan association shall be directed to pay out portions of
the cash security towards the completion of such improvements only with the
approval of the Village Engineer, who may require a balance to be maintained

improvements and assess the total against the benefitted lots. This procedure
may be followed upon condition that the subdivider furnishes the Village with a
bond, with surety to the satisfaction of the Village, guaranteeing the payment
of the assessments as they fall due. Such bond may provide that as houses are
constructed and sold to the individual owners the amount of the bond shall be
reduced not more than once each year in proportion to the amount of the
assessment against such lot. When houses have been completely constructed on
seventy-five percent (75%) of the lots the bond shall be released; or
   (c)    The subdivider may furnish corporate surety bonds in the principal
amount of the estimated cost of such improvements with surety, to the
satisfaction of the Village, in such form as is approved by the Solicitor,
guaranteeing completion and maintenance for a period of one year after
construction is complete, of such improvements according to plans, profiles and
specifications and to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. Such bond shall
remain in effect until such improvements have been completed and maintained as
provided in these regulations and until released by resolution of Council. Such
bond shall provide that upon default of performance by the subdivider the
Village may complete the same after thirty days written notice. Such bond shall
not be released until full performance.

   These rules, regulations, procedures and accompanying maps shall be known,
cited and referred to as the Village of Waite Hill Zoning Code. This Zoning
Code includes standards and/or procedures for planning and developing land
within the Village.
(Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1119.03 AUTHORITY AND SCOPE.
   This Zoning Code is adopted by the Village pursuant to its authority under
the Ohio Constitution, the Ohio Revised Code Chapter
713 and the Village of Waite Hill Charter. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be
construed to limit the Village Council in the exercise of all of the powers to
zone or redistrict now or hereafter as authorized by the Ohio Constitution, the
Ohio Revised Code, or the Village Charter.
(Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1119.05 PURPOSE.
   (a)   In general, the purpose of this Zoning Code is to promote and protect
the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare
by regulating and limiting the use of land, areas and buildings and the
erection, restoration, conversion and alteration of buildings and additions
thereto and the use of land for residential purposes; to regulate the area and
dimensions of land, yards, setbacks, and open spaces so as to secure adequate
areas for water supply and to prevent the pollution thereof; to enhance the
taxable value of land and buildings throughout the Village; to avoid congestion
by the regulation of the density of population; to regulate and restrict the
bulk, height, design, percent of lot occupancy and the location of buildings;
to assure the orderly and beneficial development of land and to provide an
orderly plan for the economical and best use of public facilities, such as
future water supply and distribution systems, sewage collection and disposal
systems.
   (b)   More specifically, but without limitation of the general purpose
hereinbefore set forth, the purpose of this Zoning Code is to:
      (1)   Preserve the character of the community.
      (2)   Provide for some grouping of one-family dwellings and to thereby
preserve the value of lands and buildings to better insure the future against
burdens of taxation.
      (3)   Provide a plan which will result in the use of lands in the Village
in accordance with a mode of life compatible with its topography, location with
respect to other communities and with its existing and contemplated character.
      (4)   Provide for the creation of a variety of designs in architecture by
so districting the Village as to give a choice to owners and prospective owners
with respect thereto.
      (5)   Plan the Village future growth and its economic, social and
cultural well being in a manner compatible with the natural phenomena by
establishing districts whereby the natural topography and attributes of the
area in each district will be best utilized, thereby minimizing the waste of
lands.
      (6)   Preserve areas for conservation of natural resources, such as
underground water supplies, woods, lakes and streams, and prevent unnatural
erosion of lands resulting from unplanned and promiscuous use solely for the
purpose of providing building sites without regard to the future general
welfare of the Village.
      (7)   Provide for a community having a similarity of interests to the end
that the economic base of the Village will be stabilized and thereby avoid
excessive costs in local government resulting from excessive amount of public
roads, streets and highways.
      (8)   Make provisions so as to avoid unnecessary capital outlay for
public utilities such as water distribution and sewage collection systems.
      (9)   Pursue and encourage the preservation and conservation of open
space in the Village by promoting development in a manner planned to harmonize
with natural surroundings, for the purpose of, but not limited to, the
following:
         A.   Maintaining a living unit density consistent with Village
tradition and the ability of the environment to absorb increased development;
         B.   Protecting and preserving the value, appearance and use of
property through the preservation of the historic character and lifestyle
consistent with the development of the Village;
         C.   Maintaining quality development;
         D.   Preserving the aesthetic value of scenic open space within the
Village;
         E.   Preserving wildlife habitat and valuable hydrologic systems; and,
         F.   Promoting the continuation of agricultural activity.
      (10)   Establish a public policy which encourages the preservation of
open space, to encourage private strategies preserving and conserving open
space in the Village by and through the creation of scenic and other easements,
gifts of land, deed restrictions and other private preservation and
conservation strategies.

use of buildings or land or upon the height and/or bulk of buildings, or
requires larger lot area, yards, setbacks, or other open spaces than are
imposed or required by such other laws or ordinances, or by such rules and
regulations, the provisions of this Zoning Code shall govern. Conversely, other

1133.17(c), Review by the Board, as will not be contrary to the public interest
according to the following procedures:
   (a)   Application Requirements. An application for a variance shall be filed
for review by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon the forms provided, and shall be
accompanied by the submission requirements below:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest, or written authority;

      (5)   Description or nature of variance requested;
      (6)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to the criteria in sub-section
1133.17 (c); and,
      (7)   A plan, neatly and legibly drawn to adequately depict the
information showing the following, where applicable:
         A.   The street providing access to the lot;
         B.   The lot/parcel identification of the subject site and the
adjacent parcels;
         C.   The zoning of the subject site and adjacent parcels;
         D.   The actual dimensions of the lot, the setbacks and other open
space dimensions thereof and the location and size of any existing structures
thereon;
         E.   The location and size of the proposed structure, and/or the
proposed enlargement of existing structures;
         F.   The location and setback of the driveways;
         G.   An elevation drawing for any proposed new structures or
additions; and,
         H.   Any other information, including but not limited to floor plans

for the enforcement of this Code.

      (9)   List of all owners of the property contiguous to and directly
across the street from the property for which the variance is requested.
      (10)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Review for Completeness. Within ten (10) days after receiving an
application for variance, the Zoning Administrator shall review the submitted
application for completeness and compliance with the applicable submission
requirements. If the application is deemed insufficient, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the necessary changes or additional
information needed. When the application is deemed complete and the application
fee has been paid, the Zoning Administrator shall officially accept the
application for consideration of the action(s) requested on the date such
determination is made and place it on the Board of Zoning Appeals' agenda.
   (c)   Review by the Board.  According to the procedures established for
appeals in this Chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing and give notice of the same. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review
each application for a variance to determine if it complies with the purpose
and intent of this Zoning Code and evidence demonstrates that the literal
enforcement of this Zoning Code will result in practical difficulty. The Board
shall not grant a variance unless it shall, in each case, make specific
findings of fact directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it
from the factors below.
Area Variance. The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the
Board to determine practical difficulty:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity;
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot; or proximity to inharmonious
uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services, such as water, sewer, or trash pickup;
      (6)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;
      (7)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
      (8)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (9)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
      (10)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and,
      (11)   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Code.
   (d)   Requests for Additional Information.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board of
Zoning Appeals deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a
variance.
   (e)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies
will be met. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the application is granted, shall be deemed a violation
punishable under Chapter
1123, Enforcement and Penalties.
   (f)   Action by the Board. The Board shall act according to the procedures
established for appeals in this Chapter.
      (1)   The Board shall:
         A.   Approve,
         B.   Approve with supplementary conditions, or
         C.   Disapprove the request.
      (2)   The Board shall have the power, in specific cases, to vary the
application of certain provisions of this Code in order that the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice
done.
         (Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1133.19 APPEAL OF BOARD'S DECISION.
   Decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final within the
Municipality, except that an appeal from any decision may be taken to the Court
of Common Pleas in accordance with the laws of the State by any proper and
interested party, including the Village of Waite Hill.

   (a)   Within the districts established by the Zoning Code, or Amendments
that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and/
or structures which were lawful before the Zoning Code was adopted but which do
not conform to regulations and restrictions under the terms of the Zoning Code.
It is the intent to permit those nonconformities to continue. It is further
intended that nonconformities not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended nor
be used as grounds for adding other lots, structures, or uses which are
otherwise prohibited.
   (b)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been issued and the construction of which was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of the Zoning Code or Amendments thereto and on which
construction has been carried on diligently in accordance with approved plans.
(Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1135.03 LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any building, structure, land,
or use hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this
Zoning Code as well as amendments made to this Zoning Code or the Official

nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
   (b)   Ordinary repairs, repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
      (Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1135.05 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where, at the time of passage of any provision of the Zoning Code, lawful
use of land and/or structures exists which would not be permitted by said
provision, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code;
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code;
   (c)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of the
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use;
   (d)   When any nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the use
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and no
nonconforming use shall thereafter be resumed;
   (e)   If any such nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of
more than six (6) months, any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations
specified by the Zoning Code for the district in which such land is located;
   (f)   Removal or destruction of the structure occupied by such nonconforming
use shall eliminate the nonconforming status. Destruction for the purpose of
this subsection is defined as damage to more than sixty-six percent (66%) of
the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village Engineer utilizing the
footprint of the building measured around its perimeter and including all
levels of the structure. No nonconforming use shall be established after said
destruction or removal;
   (g)   If a nonconforming use is altered so as to increase its conformity, it
shall not, at any time, revert to its previous level of nonconformity.
      (Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1135.07 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of any provision of the Zoning Code that could not be built under the
terms of said provision by reason of restrictions on size, height, setbacks, or
lot coverage, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, altered, or
reconstructed in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any such
structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity, except as otherwise
provided below;
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure be destroyed by fire or other
casualty to an extent of more than sixty-six percent (66%) of the structure, as
calculated by the Village Engineer utilizing the footprint of the building
measured around its perimeter and including all levels of the structure, the
remainder of the building shall be demolished and shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Code;
   (c)   Should the owner of the property intentionally demolish more than
fifty percent (50%) of the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village
Engineer utilizing the footprint of the building measured around its perimeter
and including all levels of the structure, the remainder of the building shall
be demolished and shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Code;
   (d)   If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due
to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located;
   (e)   Any structure which is nonconforming solely because of its
encroachment in a required setback area may be extended in any lawful manner
that does not further encroach in that setback.
      (Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1135.09 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of any
provision of this Zoning Code, which does not meet the requirements of said
provision, shall be considered buildable provided that the site plan meets all
setback requirements established by the Zoning Code.
   (b)   No such lot or parcel or portion thereof shall be used or sold in a
manner diminishing compliance with lot width and area requirements established
by the Zoning Code, nor shall any division be made which creates a lot width or
area below the requirements stated in the Zoning Code.

1139.03 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map designated as
the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map, which is signed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission of Waite Hill, Ohio, and all of the notations,
references and other information shown thereon, are a part of this Code and
have the same force and effect as if the Official Zoning Map and all the
notations, references and other information shown thereon were all fully set
forth or described herein, the original of which is properly attested to and is
on file with the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Code.
   (c)   In the event that the Map becomes damaged, destroyed or lost, Council
may by Ordinance adopt a new, Official Zoning Map, which shall supersede the
prior Map. The new Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the
prior Map.
(Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1139.05 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules
shall apply:
   (a)   Where the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides
with the location of a street, the centerline of such street shall be construed
to be the boundary of such district;
   (b)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets, but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to
be the boundary of such district;
   (c)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets or lot lines, the district boundaries shall be determined by the use of
the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map described in sub-section
1139.03;
   (d)   All streets, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way, if
not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone
as the property immediately abutting upon such streets, public ways, waterways
and railroad rights-of-way;
   (e)   Where the centerline of a street, public way, waterway, or railroad
right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of
the abutting property up to the centerline;
   (f)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
action as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining the each side of such
public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and
all areas included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all
regulations of the extended; and,
   (g)   All uncertainties and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning
district boundaries shall be resolved by the Planning and Zoning Commission
according to the rules and regulations that it may adopt.

   (g)   Fences and Walls. The purpose of this subsection is to affirm the
Village policy encouraging the preservation and conservation of open space and
to establish regulations controlling the location, installation, maintenance
and standards for fences in order that a property owner may construct and
maintain a fence which secures privacy, offers attractive landscape design and/
or affords security while assuring that such fences are located and constructed
so as to respect the rights and enjoyment of neighboring property owners,
preserving the integrity of scenic zones, maintaining the appearance of the
community, and securing the overall health, safety and public welfare of the
residents of the Village.
      (1)   Scope.  This subsection
1141.15(g) sets forth regulations pertaining to the location, installation,
maintenance and standards for new fences in all residential zoning districts in
the Village.
         A.   Any fence erected prior to the date of the adoption of this
subsection
1141.15(g) which does not comply with these regulations shall be nonconforming.
However, such nonconformance shall not cause an order for removal. The Village
may order immediate remedial measures to alleviate or prevent any hazardous
conditions when the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such
conditions, whether conforming or nonconforming, jeopardize the health and
safety of residents, occupants, wildlife or domestic animals.
         B.   Trellises, living fences, hedges and other living materials shall
not be deemed to constitute fences within the meaning of this subsection
1141.15(g).
         C.   All fences shall require review and approval in accordance with
Chapter
1127, Site Plan Review Procedures.
      (2)   Definitions. As used in this subsection
1141.15(g), certain terms are defined as follows:
         A.   "Fence" means any structure composed of wood, iron, steel,
masonry, stone or any other materials which are erected in such a manner and in
such a location so as to in whole or in part enclose, secure, provide privacy,
decorate, define the scope or limits of, or otherwise enhance all or an
identifiable part of any premises.
         B.   "Fence open area" means the percentage of the surface area of a
fence which permits passage of light and air. In computing the "fence open
area" gates and/or gate opening areas shall not be considered. No area higher
than the highest horizontal fence part nor lower than the lowest horizontal
fence part shall be considered as contributing to or constituting a part of the
surface area of a fence when computing the "fence open area" required by this
Chapter.
         C.   "Surface area" means the area between the highest horizontal
fence part and the lowest horizontal fence part, excluding gates and/or gate
opening areas.
         D.   "Ornamental fence" means a fence constructed for its beauty or
decorative effect and when viewed at a right angle, has not less than seventy-
five percent (75%) of the area of its vertical plane, the area within a
rectangular outline enclosing all parts of the fence in its plane, as "fence
open area." Ornamental fences include:

not encroach upon another lot or parcel of land. The Village shall furnish such
inspection as is deemed necessary to determine that the fence is constructed in
accordance with the plan submitted for site plan review, provided however, that
the issuance of the zoning certificate by the Village shall not be construed to
mean that the Village has determined that the fence is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of any duty imposed upon
him by this or any other ordinance, code and/or the general laws of the State
of Ohio.
         B.   Appeals to Board of Zoning Appeals. Any party adversely affected,
including the Village, may take a written appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
in accordance with Chapter
1133, Appeals and Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit variances
from these regulations in cases where exceptional physical conditions exist, or
the established regulations or standards of this section are inappropriate or
inapplicable, and the requested variances will not adversely affect the
purposes of this subsection
1141.15(g).
   (h)   Additional Regulations for Vehicles.  
      (1)   The repainting, rebuilding, overhauling, or dismantling of a

      (6)   The impervious area used for the outside storage and parking of
recreational vehicle/equipment shall be included in the computation of the
maximum lot coverage.
   (j)   Home Occupation. The purpose of this section is to set forth
regulations, which control the establishment and operation of home occupations.
The intent of these regulations is to control the non-residential use of a
residential dwelling unit so that the non-residential use is limited to an
accessory use, and shall not in any way adversely affect the uses permitted in
the residence district of which they are a part. Compliance with these
regulations should result in all home occupations being located and conducted
in such a manner that their existence is not detectable in any manner from the
outside of the dwelling unit.
Home occupations shall be a permitted accessory use when conducted in
compliance with the following standards. When not in compliance with the
following standards, such home occupation shall be declared a nuisance pursuant
to the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Waite Hill.
      (1)   Home occupations shall be clearly incidental and secondary in
importance to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes.
      (2)   No more than one (1) person other than members of the family
residing on the premises shall be engaged in such home occupation;
      (3)   The occupation shall be conducted wholly within a principal or
accessory building, and the space used for the home occupation shall not occupy
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the net floor area of all buildings on
the zoning lot.
      (4)   No home occupation shall be carried on that will substantially
change the residential character of the dwelling or the accessory building.
      (5)   All storage of materials, goods, supplies or equipment related to
the operation of a home occupation shall be inside the principal or accessory
building.
      (6)   The number of automobiles or trucks attracted to the premise shall
not be greater than that which is normally associated with residential uses.
      (7)   The noise, fumes, and vibrations generated by a home occupation
shall not be greater than the expected levels or amounts typical of a
residential area, and such noise level, fumes or vibrations shall not create a
nuisance in the neighborhood.
      (8)   No wholesale, jobbing, or retail business shall be permitted unless
it is conducted entirely by mail, telephone, or electronically and does not
involve the receipt, delivery, sale or storage of merchandise on or from the
premises.
   (k)   Power Conversion Facilities. "Power Conversion Facilities" means
equipment that is designed for the conversion of wind, solar, or other natural
energy, or storage of same, and is permitted as an accessory use to the
residential use of property, subject to the regulations set forth in this
section.
      (1)    No Power Conversion Facility shall be visible from any neighboring
property or from any public right of way, except as otherwise provided by this
chapter, nor shall a Power Conversion Facility compromise the design or
aesthetic appearance of a residence, as determined by the Architectural Board
of Review.
      (2)    Solar Energy Systems: A Solar Energy System consists of
photovoltaic cells and related accessories that are designed to convert solar
energy into electrical energy; or a system consisting of solar thermal
collectors, parabolic reflectors, or similar structures that are designed to
harness solar energy for use as thermal energy for heating water or air or for
some other permitted use; and may include battery storage systems on the
property meeting requirements of Section
1141.15(k). Solar Energy Systems are a conditionally permitted accessory use,
provided that the following standards and conditions are met:
         A.    Subject to the review and approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission solar panels shall be placed on the portion of the roof of any
residential or accessory building so that the panel or panels:
            i.    Are not visible from any street or sidewalk at the front of
the property or from any neighboring residence;
            ii.    Do not extend beyond the edge of the roof;
            iii.    Are placed parallel to the plane of a pitched roof (sloped
in excess of four inches (4") per foot) and are not more than eighteen inches
(18") above the surface of the roof when measured to the top of the solar
panel; and
            iv.    To provide proper system performance for low slope (pitches
less than four inches (4") per foot) and flat roofs, and then alternative
heights and configurations may be considered to exceed minimum height above the
roof as approved by the Planning Commission.
         B.    Solar panels may only be considered in roof locations that are
not in compliance with subsection (k)(1) above, or not in a rear yard, when the
applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning
Commission that:
            i.    There are no alternative locations in compliance with
subsection (k)(1);
            ii.    The proposed panels and their location(s) are designed to
minimize any adverse impacts to the neighborhood; and
            iii.    The size and location of any structure is the minimum
necessary to serve the needs of the building(s) on the property.
         C.    Solar equipment (other than the panels) shall be placed only
inside a building or in the rear yard.
         D.    Any ground mounted solar panel systems or related equipment
being proposed shall:
            i.    Only be located in a rear yard and no less than fifty feet
(50') from any side or rear yard lot line;
            ii.    Not exceed a height that is necessary, as determined by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, to perform the intended function while
permitting reasonable maintenance of both the solar panels and equipment and
the ground on which they are located;
            iii.    Comprise only the minimum area needed to provide the energy
necessary to serve the property but in no case have a maximum area greater than
one thousand (1,000) square feet when measured using a horizontal plane around
the perimeter of the system and such area shall not be in addition to that
allowed for in the maximum area allowances for accessory buildings and
structures as otherwise regulated in each zoning district; and
            iv.    Be reasonably screened from view of an adjacent property or
a street, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, by existing or
proposed landscaping and/or fencing. Existing and proposed screening shall be
shown on the plans submitted with the application.
         E.    Solar panels and related equipment shall be located, oriented,
or screened and constructed of such material as to prevent, to the fullest
extent practicable, glare from solar panels being directed at any other person,
building or public right of way.
         F.    An application for a Solar Energy System to be reviewed by the
Lake County Building Department, the fire authority having jurisdiction over
the Village, and the Planning and Zoning Commission and shall include:
            i.    Complete architectural and engineering drawings, adequately
scaled and dimensioned, depicting the location, installation, mounting,
anchorage details, appearance on the building and details for wiring and
connections, and battery storage system as noted in subsection (k)(2)F.iii.
below for the proposed system;
            ii.    The manufacturer's specifications for the system being
proposed;
            iii.    Where Battery Storage Systems are proposed for Solar Energy
Systems, they shall include, without limitation:
               a.   A list of equipment.
               b.   A site plan, showing the location of the Battery Storage
System.

               d.   A plan for fire containment.
               e.   The location for supporting structures for batteries and
equipment.
               f.   A full plan of the electrical system, including device
locations and wiring plan(s).
            iv.    A description and plan of the trees and/or other vegetation
that need to be trimmed or removed from the site for evaluating the removal of
such vegetation; and
            v.    Verification that the installer has professional training,
NABCEP certification and licensure as required for work requiring such, by
state or federal law.
         G.    When locating a solar panel, it is the property owner's
responsibility to consider current and future development, growth of trees and
vegetation, and other obstructions that might interfere with solar access.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner of the solar energy conversion
system from obtaining a solar access easement from any person.
         H.    All solar energy systems must be reviewed and approved by the
Lake County Building Department, the fire authority having jurisdiction over
the Village, and the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the issuance of a
permit to install the system.
      (3)    These regulations do not apply to geothermal energy conversion
facilities, which convert geothermal energy into energy that is usable for
residential use, which are permitted if they cannot be observed from any
neighboring property or public right of way.
      (4)    These regulations do not apply to facilities that generate
electrical energy from the use of natural gas, propane, or similar energy
sources, which facilities are permitted and subject to approval of the Planning
and Zoning Commission as to location and screening of such facilities to
minimize any negative impacts on neighboring residences.
         (Ord. 2022-10. Passed 9-12-22.)
1141.17 DESIGN CRITERIA FOR ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   (a)   The purpose of the following design criteria is to further the goals
of the Village including:
      (1)   The promotion and protection of the public health, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare by regulating the exterior design of
buildings and structures to assure orderly and reasonably harmonious
development;
      (2)   The protection and preservation of property values when buildings
are constructed or altered to prevent the impairment or destruction of real
estate values;
      (3)   The regulation, according to accepted and recognized architectural
principles, of the design and use of materials on all principal and accessory
buildings to be created, moved, altered, remodeled or repaired;
      (4)   The construction of high-quality buildings in terms of the design
and materials selected given the architectural style of the building; and,
      (5)   The prevention of the harmful effects of excessively similar,
dissimilar, or inappropriate exterior design of buildings or structures in
relation to the exterior design of buildings prevailing in the Village.
  
   (b)   The provisions of this Section shall apply to all residential
development including principal and accessory buildings. Any addition,
remodeling, relocation, or construction requiring review shall adhere to the
guidelines in this Section, where applicable. The Architectural Board of Review
may exempt applicants from these standards when the exterior building
modifications are minor in nature, meaning the design modifications will have
no discernable impact on neighboring properties, the public, the public right-
of-way, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
   (c)   Character of Dwellings. Principal dwellings and accessory building are
to be designed and located on the site and be of a scale to complement
buildings in close proximity and enhance the character of the surrounding area
by having features that are appropriate and compatible with existing buildings
and structures. In making this determination, the following shall be
considered:
      (1)   Building height, width, and general proportions;
      (2)   Architectural features, including patterns of windows and doors,
roof pitch, balconies, porches, shutters, dormers, eaves and other decorative
detail;
      (3)   Building materials.
      (4)   Explanation Of Terms.  Certain terms and words shall be interpreted
with regard to the following explanations:
         A.   Appropriateness. A proposal is judged to be appropriate when it
respects the existing architectural style of a building or buildings and fits
comfortably within its setting, neighborhood and overall community. This
condition applies to landscaping and accessory structures, as well.
         B.   Compatibility.  A design or a material selection is compatible
when it does not strongly deviate from the buildings on the site, or the
overall character of the neighborhood. To be compatible does not require look
alike designs, but rather designs that reflect some aspects of the building or
buildings in the general vicinity, such as scale of windows, overhangs,
building materials, patterns of siding, roof slope. Conversely, incompatibility
occurs when an architectural design, landscape design or accessory building
proposal is aesthetically harsh or overwhelming relative to its neighbors. The
Architectural Board of Review need not consider compatibility when the building
under review is determined to be so isolated that it has no bearing on adjacent
property or the neighborhood.
         C.   Proportion. The relationship of parts of a building, landscape,
structures, or buildings to each other and to the whole balance.
         D.   Proximity.  Proximity shall be considered in terms of the
potential for one property, by virtue of its location, to materially affect
other properties. In determining a property to be in proximity to another, the
following factors shall be considered:
            i.   The visibility of both properties from a common point; or,
            ii.   The location of both properties within a relatively compact
network of streets, walkways, or spaces.
   (d)   Façade Articulation. The articulation of facades and the massing of
structures give them richness and scale. Long uninterrupted exterior walls
should be avoided. All building walls should have relief to create interest and
reduce bulk.
   (e)   Roof Articulation. For sloped roofs, both vertical and horizontal
articulation is encouraged. Rooflines should be representative of the design
and scale of surrounding dwellings. Roof articulation may be achieved by
changes in plane and/or the use of traditional roof forms such as gables, hips,
and dormers.

lots for cluster one-family detached dwellings are included as part of a
Conservation Development, such lots or sub lots shall be of sufficient size and
shape to accommodate dwelling units in compliance with the spacing requirements
of this Section.
   (e)   Required Buffer: A buffer area from an existing public street right-
of-way and from a perimeter side or rear property line is required and shall be
landscaped with an acceptably designed wall, fence, planting screen, or mound,
or some combination thereof, to provide adequate landscaping between the
proposed development and adjacent areas to assure privacy for existing and
future residents.
   (f)   Utilities: Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical
systems, are required within the limits of a Conservation Development.
Appurtenances to these systems that can be effectively screened may be exempted
from this requirement if the Village finds that such exemption will not violate
the intent or character of the proposed Conservation Development.

zones shown on the Zoning Map.
   (i)   Additional Standards: Additional development requirements, whether
standards or criteria, formulated to achieve the objectives of the Conservation
Development may be established at the time a Conservation Development site plan
is reviewed. Any such development requirements adopted with such plan shall
become binding land use requirements for the development.
   (j)   Waivers: In the event the Village, determines that certain standards
set forth in this Chapter do not or should not apply specifically to the
circumstances of a particular project and an alternative method of achieving
the objectives of the numerical standard is equal to or better than the strict
application of the specified standard, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
relax such standard to the extent deemed just and proper, provided that the
granting of such relief shall be without detriment to the health and safety of
the community and without detriment to or impairment of the intent of this
Chapter. However, if the Planning and Zoning Commission permits the required
open space to be located on individual, subdivided lots, a deed restriction or
other legal mechanism should be utilized to insure that the required open space
remains in the state shown on the approved final site plan.

CHAPTER 1145
Building Zone Development District
1145.01    Purpose and application.
1145.03    Establishment of building zone development district.
1145.05    General development criteria.
1145.07    Compliance with existing development standards.
1145.09    Additional procedures.
1145.11    Submission requirements.
1145.13    Plan approval criteria.
1145.01 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   Purpose.  The Building Zone Development District (BZ) regulations are
based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a built environment or
development proposal is determined by the way in which such land uses are
executed. In many cases, the subdivision regulations and standard zoning
district regulations do not adequately regulate the location and density of
dwellings that are appropriate in the Village of Waite Hill. The Building Zone
Development District permits the formation of unique development standards,
including greater residential density than would otherwise be permitted, that
are appropriate for a given site in exchange for constructing all buildings in
the building zones shown on the Zoning Map.
      (1)   The purposes of the Building Zone Development District regulations
are to:
         A.   Allow the creation of development standards that respect the
unique characteristics, natural quality and beauty of the site and the
immediate vicinity and protect the community's natural resources by avoiding
development on, and destruction of, sensitive environmental areas.
         B.   Ensure that the development project is properly integrated into
its surroundings and is compatible with adjacent development through
appropriate development controls.
         C.   Establish objective criteria for plan review that ensures
conformity to community standards.
      (2)   The review procedures for Building Zone Development Districts are
designed to encourage:
         A.   Unified development projects that exhibit creative planning and
design in ways that cannot be achieved through a standard zoning district or
subdivision regulation, yet are consistent with all of the Village's goals and
are compatible with contiguous land uses and the intent of this Zoning Code.
         B.   Imaginative architectural design.
         C.   Flexibility in building types.
         D.   Proper relationships between buildings, between developments and
between structures and the land.
         E.   The development of the land in an orderly, coordinated and
comprehensive manner consistent with accepted land planning, landscape
architecture practices and engineering principles according to approved site
plans.
   
   (b)   Application. The Building Zone Development District regulations assist
in accomplishing these purposes by establishing review steps that combine the
request for a zoning district change with the site plan review process, and
when applicable, the subdivision process. Subsequent plan review following the
zoning district change also requires simultaneous review of subdivision plats.
      (1)   Each Building Zone Development District shall be considered a
separate and unique zoning district wherein a preliminary site plan, including
associated text depicting the specific development standards and development
commitments, is adopted simultaneously with the adoption of the Building Zone
Development District designation. The preliminary site plan shall apply only to
the property within that particular Building Zone Development District.
      (2)   The preliminary site plan adopted at the time of rezoning to the
Building Zone Development District shall be prepared in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter and the requirements contained herein.
      
   (c)   Ownership. The Building Zone Development District shall be an
integrated, unified development project and the entire project area shall be in
single ownership or joint ownership and/or control at the time the application
is made for the BZ designation so that all property owners are applicants
throughout the site plan review process. Any transfer of land within the
development after an application has been filed and/or approved shall not alter
the applicability of the regulations contained herein. A preliminary site plan
approved in accordance with these regulations for a Building Zone Development
District shall be binding upon the owners, their successors and assigns and
shall limit and control the issuance and validity of all certificates of zoning
compliance.
(Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)
1145.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF BUILDING ZONE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   A Building Zone Development District shall be established according to the
following:
   (a)   All rezonings to a Building Zone Development District shall be
designated on the Zoning Map as BZD.
   (b)   A request for rezoning land to a Building Zone Development District
designation shall be made according to Chapter
1131, Amendments.
   (c)   A preliminary site plan shall be reviewed according to the procedures
in Chapter
1127, Site Plan Review Procedures, and a preliminary site plan and supporting
documentation shall be adopted at the time of rezoning.
   (d)   A final site plan shall be reviewed and acted upon according to in
Chapter
1127, Site Plan Review Procedures.
   (e)   A preliminary plat may be reviewed simultaneously with a preliminary
site plan. A final plat shall be reviewed simultaneously with a final site
plan, unless a final plat is not required for completion of the project. All
subdivision plats shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to Title One of Part
Eleven of the Village's Planning and Zoning Code, except as otherwise provided
for in this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2011-14. Passed 4-9-12.)

prosperity and general welfare by regulating the exterior design and location
of buildings and structures to assure orderly and reasonable harmonious
developments in the municipality and in each neighborhood thereof;

principles, the design, use of materials, finished grade lines, dimensions,
orientation and location of all main and accessory buildings to be created,
moved, altered, remodeled or repaired, subject to the provisions of Zoning
Codes and other applicable ordinances of the municipality. In considering
building proposals the Architectural Board of Review shall consider and take
cognizance of the development of adjacent, contiguous and neighboring buildings
and properties for the purpose of achieving safe, harmonious and integrated
development of related properties;
   (d)   To prevent the harmful effects of excessively similar, dissimilar, or

Harmful or adverse effects, immediate or in the future, to be prevented are:

existing residential property; or

for residential purposes; or

real property in the municipality including the effects of capricious, faddish

of such paper documents as the applicant wishes the Board to consider, and one
portable document format (pdf) copy of all documents submitted in a paper
format. If the failure to submit all documents in a timely fashion prevents the
giving of timely notice that is required under this Chapter, the matter shall
be placed on the next subsequent Board agenda so that notices that are required
by this Chapter may be made in the time required herein.
      (2)    When an application is made for the Preliminary Review of a new
residence, the applicant shall submit photographs from each neighboring
residence that will be able to see the new residence (assuming no new screening
is installed) so as to provide evidence of the current conditions of the site.
If permission cannot be obtained from a neighboring property owner to get a
photo of the actual view from the residence of the neighbor, the applicant
shall submit a photo of the site from a location which is taken from the
direction of the neighboring property owner, which shall be either from the
applicant's property or from a public right of way.
      (3)    The applicant shall be required to submit pdf versions of all
documents that receive approval by the Village. If no changes are required as a
consequence of Final Approval, the pdf that was submitted at the time of the
application for Final Approval shall be sufficient to meet this requirement. In
the event a project receives Conditional Approval, no zoning permit shall be
issued until the applicant submits a pdf of each of the documents which have
been changed pursuant to the Conditional Approval.
   (b)   Preliminary Review; Suggestions; Preliminary Approval.  
      (1)   Any person who seeks to construct a new residence or construct an
addition to a residence which changes the footprint of a residence within the
Village shall obtain a preliminary review of the proposed design by the Board
before an application for Final Approval is presented to the Board for
consideration. Any person seeking to alter a structure within the Village in a
manner which materially changes the exterior appearance or size of such
structure is encouraged to seek a preliminary review of the proposed design
changes. The recommendations of the Board on a preliminary review are intended
to assure that high quality of exterior design excellence and landscape harmony
are preserved in the Village at a time when the conceptual design of the
project is being developed.
      (2)   Documents supporting a preliminary review shall be submitted in
accordance with subsection (g) of this section, and may be made of conceptual
sketches and sketch plans which convey: the general nature of the architectural
floor plans; the site plan indicating the topography, existing tree cover, and
related access roadways; the context and/or visual relationship to adjacent
residences and properties; and the visual massing and appearance of all sides
of the proposed structure. A new house shall be designed in an established and
recognized style, and its exterior size, shape, materials, color and texture
should be compatible with existing houses and it shall fit into its site and
its scenic surroundings so as to be complementary and unobtrusive.
      (3)   The Board may make suggestions regarding the proposed design, and
indicate any problems the applicant is likely to encounter if final plans are
presented in conformance with the preliminary plans.
      (4)   The Board shall grant "Preliminary Approval" if the Board
determines that the proposed design presented in the preliminary plans is
sufficient to warrant final plans. If the Board does not grant Preliminary
Approval, it shall advise the applicant of the reasons Preliminary Approval was
not granted.
   (c)   Preliminary Approval. Preliminary Approval shall be marked upon the
conceptual drawings of the residence or other structure(s). Preliminary
Approval shall be evidence that the concepts presented are acceptable to the
Architectural Board of Review, and the project should proceed to final
drawings.
   (d)   Final Review. Each application for Final Approval by the Architectural
Board of Review shall be submitted in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section, and shall have scale drawings including:
      (1)   A site plan showing the proposed building location, property
boundary lines, topography, any prominent ground or site features, and the
distances from the nearest points of each building to be constructed to the
front, rear and side property lines (i.e. the setbacks);
      (2)   Floor plans;
      (3)   Building elevations;
      (4)   Transverse and longitudinal sections and wall sections; and written
specifications, that, taken together, provide a detailed description of the
site placement, size, volume and appearance of the proposed building; and
      (5)   A plan of any landscape features to be installed as a part of the
proposed project.
   (e)   Approval; Disapproval. If the Architectural Board of Review finds,
upon review of the final plans, that the plot plan and exterior design and
accompanying documents conform to the requirements of the standards and
criteria set forth in this Chapter, it shall grant Final Approval. If such
design and documents do not conform, it may grant "Conditional Approval" by
specifying modifications which would make the same acceptable. If the Board
finds the exterior design for a building or structure would produce harmful
effects within the Village, or otherwise not comply with the standards and
criteria of this chapter, the Board shall disapprove the application, design
and accompanying documents. In the event the Board fails to act upon the final
plans within one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing date of the
application, the application will be deemed to be approved.
   (f)   Final Approval. Final Approval or disapproval of the plot plan and of
the exterior design and accompanying documents shall be endorsed thereon by the
Board by its Chairman, or by the Clerk-Treasurer in the event of action by the
Village Council, as described in Section
1313.06(f). In the event the Board or Council issues Conditional Approval, the
conditions shall be noted in writing upon the appropriate plans to which the
conditions apply. The Secretary shall not issue any zoning permit for any
application which has not received Final Approval, nor shall any zoning permit
be issued for any application which has granted Conditional Approval unless and
until the conditions noted on the plans have been satisfied. After Final
Approval is granted, any changes which will materially affect the look of the
residences shall be submitted to the Board via the same process that Final
Approval is considered, and adjudicated on the basis of the same standards
applied at the time of Final Approval.
   (g)   Appeal to Council.  
      (1)   If the Board disapproves any application or makes any determination
adverse to the applicant, the applicant shall have twenty (20) days after the
meeting at which the announcement of the decision is made to file a notice of
appeal to the Village Council of the adverse decision. Such notice shall be
filed with the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (2)   The Village Council shall place the matter for hearing on the
agenda for the next regular meeting of the Village Council following the filing
of the notice of appeal, provided that the notice of appeal is filed at least
fourteen (14) days prior to the next Village Council meeting; otherwise the
Village Council shall place the appeal on the agenda of the subsequent regular
meeting.
      (3)   The Village Council shall decide the appeal within ninety (90) days
of the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the applicant requests additional
time for decision. A failure by the Village Council to decide the matter within
ninety (90) days of the notice of appeal shall be deemed to be an affirmance of
the decision of the Board. The decision of the Village Council shall be final
within the Village. In the event the Village Council reverses or modifies the
decision of the Board, the Clerk-Treasurer shall endorse the approval or
modification, which was ordered by the Village Council, and issue the
appropriate permits.
         (Ord. 2016-9. Passed 3-13-17.)
1313.07 EVALUATION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Excessive Dissimilarity. The exterior design and size of a building or
structure, its orientation on the site, and its landscape treatment shall not
be excessively dissimilar to any other existing building, structure, site plan
or landscape plan in the neighborhood. For the purposes of this section, a
building, structure, site plan or landscape plan shall be deemed to be
"existing" if a valid permit has been issued for its construction.
   (b)   Excessive Similarity. The exterior design and size of a building or
structure shall not be excessively similar in relation to any other building or
structure, existing or for which a permit has been issued, on a lot located
such that the buildings may be viewed simultaneously, particularly any of the
following features of exterior design:
      (1)   Facade. An elevation shall not be apparently identical, including
the size and arrangement of either doors, windows, porches, or other openings
or breaks in the facade, nor shall there be a directly reverse arrangement;
      (2)   Other significant features. Architectural features, including but
not limited to materials, colors, roofline, or other design elements shall not
be apparently identical.
   (c)   Inappropriate Design. If, based upon evidence in the record, the Board
determines that a building, structure, addition, site plan or landscape plan is
inconsistent with the predominant architectural style of another residence or
residences in the neighborhood, or is otherwise inconsistent with other
elements of the design of the building, structure, site plan or landscape plan,
the Board may make a finding that the design is inappropriate. A building that
is not a recognized style is an inappropriate design which shall not be
approved.
   (d)   Harmful Effects of Design.  In order to prevent the harmful effects of
excessively similar, dissimilar, or inappropriate exterior design and/or
location of buildings or structures in relation to the exterior design of
buildings prevailing in the municipality, the Board must also issue a finding
or findings, based upon the evidence in the record, that such similarity,
dissimilarity or inappropriateness will produce one or more harmful effects, as
set forth in Section
1313.04(d) of this Chapter. (Ord. 2016-9. Passed 3-13-17.)
1313.08 EVALUATION CRITERIA.
   The following criteria are established to guide the Architectural Review
Board in its review of proposals and in applying the evaluation standards set
forth in Section
1313.07:
   (a)   Materials shall be appropriate for the use of the building, and for
their relationship to other materials, including those used on adjacent
buildings.
   (b)   The design of any building shall be judged in reference to its site
and the character of its surroundings, not as an independent object.
   (c)   The gross floor area for a residence shall be in character with the
surrounding neighborhood and not be excessively large relative to the site or
in comparison to adjacent residences;
   (d)   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of the
building, and for their relationship to the site and adjacent buildings. Colors
shall be harmonious and shall use only compatible accents.
   (e)   Architectural details and ornaments shall be meaningful to the overall
design and appropriate for the size and scale of the building.
   (f)   The design must include sufficient details, accents, and appropriate
architectural features on each façade of the building so that each elevation is
fundamentally sound; such architectural design is commonly referred to as "360?
design." For example, if the front of the building has a stone water table, the
stone should be carried around the sides and rear of the building so that the
entire building is the product of a unified, coherent, and integrated design.
   (g)   Buildings should be sited to minimize grade changes and to take
advantage of natural features, including mature trees. Buildings shall be set
at proper grades and otherwise in proper relation to the proposed surroundings.
   (h)   Mechanical equipment shall be considered as it affects rooftop
appearance, sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke and other nuisance aspects.
   (i)   Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be considered as they
affect the appearance from the street and from the site as well. The
relationship of paving to the building shall be appropriate considered factors
such as safety, drainage and landscaping.
   (j)   Landscaping shall be appropriate for the size and use of the area, and
for its relationship to the building, street, parking areas, walks and adjacent
buildings.
   (k)   Lighting shall be considered for the appropriateness of nighttime
illumination of the grounds, drives, walks, parking areas and the building, and
its effect upon surrounding areas.
   (l)   Signs shall be considered for the appropriateness of size, scale,
shape, color and illumination in relation to the building site and neighboring
sites.
      (Ord. 2016-9. Passed 3-13-17.)
1313.09 SPECIFIC DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The Village has certain existing standards with which new construction
should comply, when feasible, so as to not adversely impact the value of
existing properties. These standards include:
   (a)   There shall be no basement windows on the front elevation of the
residence;
   (b)   Roofs shall be constructed of high quality materials, and the look of
a dimensional shingle is preferred for asphalt shingle roofs;
   (c)   Fireplace chimneys, furnace flues, and foundation walls that are
above-grade shall be clad with brick or stone;
   (d)   Flue pipes and utility services shall, to the extent possible, be
blocked from the views of neighbors and from public rights of way by
architectural features and/or appropriate landscaping. (Ord. 2016-9. Passed 3-
13-17.)
1313.10 PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS PREPARED BY REGISTERED ARCHITECT.
   (a)   In order to ensure that exterior design choices for new buildings and
additions to buildings are architecturally appropriate, all construction to
erect or modify any building, except an accessory building that is less than
two hundred (200) square feet in area, shall be built according to plans and
specifications prepared by an architect registered for the practice of
architecture in the State at the time the plans are submitted to the Village.
All plans and specifications submitted for approval shall be signed or scaled
by a registered architect.
   (b)   All plans and specifications required to be prepared by a registered
architect and submitted to the Village for approval shall be accompanied by a
certificate of a registered architect stating for whom the plans and
specifications were prepared, the location at which the building or structure
is to be constructed, the date of the plans and specifications and a statement
attesting to the fact that they were prepared by such registered architect
personally or by employees in his or her office or organization under his or
her personal supervision.
(Ord. 2020-11. Passed 9-14-20.)
1313.99 PENALTY. 
   (a)   Any owner of any building or premises or part thereof, who violates
the terms of this chapter, or any architect, builder, or contractor who assists
in the commission of any such violation, or any person who fails to comply with
an order of the Architectural Board of Review, shall, for each violation or
failure to comply, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each
day such violation or failure to comply exists shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (b)   In lieu of or in addition to the prosecution for any criminal
violation authorized by subsection (a) hereof, the Law Director may institute
an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to
prevent an unlawful condition; to restrain, correct or abate a violation; to

1315.02 PURPOSE.
   The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of Personal Wireless Service Facilities in order
to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same
time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless telecommunications marketplace in the Village.
   Specifically, the purposes of this chapter are:
   (a)    To regulate the location of the personal wireless service facilities
in the Village;
   (b)    To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of personal wireless service facilities;
   (c)    To minimize adverse visual impact of personal wireless service
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
   (d)    To promote and encourage shared use/collocation of personal wireless
service facilities as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use personal wireless service facilities;
   (e)    To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new personal wireless
service facilities;
   (f)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by personal wireless
service facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully
designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or
are determined to be structurally unsound; and
   (g)    To ensure that personal wireless service facilities are compatible
with surrounding land uses. (Ord. 1998-9. Passed 3-9-98.)
1315.03 LOCATION.
   (a)    Existing Structures; Policy. Personal wireless service facilities
shall be located on existing structures, including but not limited to
buildings, water towers, existing telecommunications facilities, utility poles
or towers, and related facilities, provided that such installation preserves
the character and integrity of those structures.
   (b)    Existing Structures; Burden of Proof. The applicant shall have the
burden of proving that there are no existing structures which are suitable to
locate its Personal Wireless Service Facilities and/or transmit or receive
radio signals. To meet the burden, the applicant shall take all the following
actions to the extent applicable:
      (1)    The applicant shall submit to the Village of Waite Hill a list of
all contacts made with owners of potential sites regarding the availability of
potential space for a personal wireless service facilities. If the Village of
Waite Hill informs the applicant that additional existing structures may be
satisfactory, the applicant shall contact the property owners(s) of those
structures.
      (2)    The applicant shall provide copies of all letters of inquiry made
to owners of existing structures and letters of rejection. If letters of
rejection are not provided, at a minimum, unanswered "Return Receipt Requested"
forms from the U.S. Post office shall be provided for each owner of existing
structures that was contacted.
      (3)    If the applicant claims that a structure is not capable of
physically supporting a personal wireless service facilities, this claim must
be certified by a licensed professional civil or structural engineer. The
certification shall, at a minimum, explain the structural issues and
demonstrate that the structure cannot be modified to support the Personal
Wireless Service Facilities without unreasonable cost. The estimated cost shall
be provided to the Village of Waite Hill.
   (c)    Right-of-Way.
       (1)    The Village of Waite Hill prefers that personal wireless service
facilities locate in a right-of-way owned by the Village. The second preference
is that personal wireless service facilities locate in a right-of-way owned by
another public agency.
      (2)    The Village of Waite Hill prefers that personal wireless service
facilities within a right-of-way be placed on existing or replaced utility
poles or light standards. The second preference is that personal wireless
service facilities be ground-mounted in the right-of-way to appear like a
utility pole or light standard.
    (d)    New Personal Wireless Service Facilities. New personal wireless
service facilities may be located only on properties not residentially used but
otherwise occupied properties, and shall be subject to the regulations set
forth in this chapter and the regulations of the particular zoning district in
which the personal wireless service facilities is proposed to be located but
only to the extent such regulations do not conflict with the regulations set
forth in this chapter. Such facilities may be located in residential zoning
districts so long as they are not located on residentially used parcels or upon
vacant or unused parcels and shall be subject to the regulations set forth in
this chapter and the regulations of the particular zoning district in which the
facility is proposed to be located but only to the extent such regulations do
not conflict with the regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (e)    All personal wireless service facilities up to 100 feet in height
shall be set back on all sides a distance equal to the underlying setback
requirement in the applicable zoning district. Such facilities in excess of 100
feet in height shall be set back one additional foot per each foot of personal
wireless service facility height in excess of 100 feet.

disapproves the Commission's action in granting the permit, the permit shall be
void and shall not be issued, otherwise, it, together with any additional
conditions imposed by Council, becomes and is in full force and effect on the
day next succeeding the thirty-day period. However, should Council approve the
action of the Commission within the thirty-day period, the permit becomes in
full force and effect from the date of the approval. Any decision to deny a
permit to place, construct, or modify a wireless communication antenna and/or
personal wireless service facility shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record of the proceedings of the
Council.
(Ord. 1998-9. Passed 3-9-98.)
1315.05 STANDARDS.
   The Commission shall consider, and the applicant shall demonstrate,
compliance with the following standards in determining whether to approve an
application for a personal wireless service facility:
   (a)    Height.
      (1)    Height, existing structures and utility poles. Carriers that
locate new personal wireless service facilities on water towers, electric
transmission and distribution towers, utility poles and similar existing
utility structures, guyed towers, lattice towers, masts, and monopoles may be
permitted to increase the height of these structures no more than twenty feet,
such height to include the uppermost portion of the facility. This increase in
height shall only be permitted once for each structure.
      (2)    Height, other existing structures. The height of a personal
wireless service facility shall not increase the height of a structure by more
than ten feet unless the facility is completely camouflaged; for example a
facility completely within a flagpole, steeple, or chimney. The increase in
height of the structure shall be scaled and proportioned to the structure as
originally configured.
      (3)    Height, ground-mounted facilities. Ground-mounted Personal
Wireless Service Facilities shall not project higher than ten feet above the
average tree canopy height within a 150 foot perimeter of the mount, security
barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment, whichever is
greater.
   (b)    Visibility.
      (1)    Visual impacts are measured on the basis of:
         A.    Change in community scale, as exhibited in relative height, mass
or proportion of the personal wireless service facilities within its proposed
surroundings.
         B.    New visible elements proposed on a contrasting background.
         C.    Different colors and textures proposed against a contrasting
background.
         D.    Use of materials that are foreign to the existing built
environment.
      (2)    Enhancements are measured on the basis of:
         A.    Conservation of opportunities to maintain community scale, e.g.,
open space areas and low-lying buildings should not be compromised so as to
start a trend away from existing community scale.
         B.    Amount and type of landscaping and/or natural vegetation.
         C.    Preservation of view corridors, vistas, and view sheds.
         D.    Continuation of existing colors, textures, and materials.
      (3)    Visibility focuses on:
         A.    Eliminating or mitigating visual impact.
         B.    Protecting, continuing, and enhancing the existing environment.
   (c)    Equipment Shelters. Equipment shelters for personal wireless service
facilities shall be designed consistent with one of the following design
standards:
      (1)    Equipment shelters shall be located in underground vaults; or
      (2)    Equipment shelters shall be designed so that the shelters are
architecturally consistent, with respect to materials and appearance, to the
buildings in the area of the personal wireless service facility; or
      (3)    Equipment shelters shall be camouflaged behind an effective year-
round landscape buffer, equal to the height of the proposed building, and/or
wooden fence. The Village of Waite Hill shall determine the type of fencing
and/or landscape buffer that is compatible with the neighborhood; or
      (4)    If mounted on a rooftop, the equipment shelter shall be concealed
or camouflaged so that the shelter either is not visible at grade or appears to
be part of the original structure.
   (d)    Antenna Types. Any antenna array placed upon an existing or proposed
ground mount, utility pole, or transmission line mount shall have a diameter of
no more than four feet, exclusive of the diameter of the mount. A larger
diameter antenna array may be permitted after a finding by the Village of Waite
Hill that the visual impacts of a larger antenna array are negligible.
   (e)    Ground and Roof Mounts. All ground mounts shall be of a mast type
mount. Lattice personal wireless service facilities, guyed personal wireless
service facilities, and roof mounted monopoles are expressly prohibited.
   (f)    Collocation. Applicant must prove that there is no technically
suitable space reasonably available on an existing Personal Wireless Service
Facilities or structure within the geographic area to be served. In all cases,
the Village shall use its best efforts to encourage collocation.
   (g)    Screening. Screen fencing shall be provided for aesthetic and public
safety reasons. A fence at least six feet in height will be erected completely
around the communication personal wireless service facility and any related
support facilities. Barbed wire at the top of the fence is permitted.
   (h)    Wind Load. Personal wireless service facilities and antenna shall be
designed to withstand wind gusts of at least 100 miles an hour.
   (i)    Landscaping. A landscaped buffer area of not less than ten feet in
depth shall be placed between the personal wireless service facilities and the
public rights-of way, residential zoning districts and any adjacent residential
uses. The ten-foot landscape buffer shall consist of a tight screen fence of
hardy evergreen shrubbery not less than six feet in height. The landscaping
shall be continuously maintained and promptly restored, if necessary.
   (j)    Storage. Outdoor storage of any supplies, vehicles or equipment
related to the use of the facility is prohibited.
   (k)    Lighting. Except as required by law, an antenna or a personal
wireless service facility shall not be illuminated and lighting fixtures or
signs shall not be attached to the antenna or personal wireless service
facility. If lighting is required by FAA regulations, white strobe lights shall
not be permitted at night unless no other less bothersome, annoying and
disturbing alternative is permitted by the FAA. Lighting for security purposes
shall be permitted at the personal wireless service facility with a prior
approval of the Commission and Council.
   (l)    Compliance with Federal Law. The applicant must provide written
certification from an engineer that the antenna and/or personal wireless
service facility is to be constructed in compliance with all applicable
federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the construction.
   (m)    Separation. There shall be a separation of at least one quarter mile
between personal wireless service facilities. The Commission may waive this
requirement for personal wireless service facilities associated with or within
existing structures such as electrical high tension towers.
    (n)    Advertising. No advertising shall be permitted on the personal
wireless service facility. (Ord. 1998-9. Passed 3-9-98.)
1315.06 REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.
   The applicant shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the Village
for any legal, planning and/or technical engineering services deemed necessary
by the Commission to perform the review required by this chapter.
(Ord. 1998-9. Passed 3-9-98.)

located on Village-owned property, by permission of the Village Council, shall
be exempt from the regulations set forth in this chapter and any other
provisions of the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1998-9. Passed 3-9-98.)
1315.08 ABANDONMENT.
   (a)    All providers utilizing personal wireless service facilities shall
present a report to the Commission notifying them of any personal wireless
service facility located in the Village whose use will be discontinued and the
date this use will cease. If at any time the use of the facility is
discontinued for 180 days, the Commission may declare the facility abandoned.
(This excludes any dormancy period between construction and the initial use of
the facility.) The facility's owner/operator will receive written notice from
the Commission and shall be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use
within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If reactivation or
dismantling does not occur, the Municipality will remove or will contract to
have removed the facility and assess the owner/operator the costs.
   (b)    To secure the obligation set forth in subsection (a) hereof, the
applicant and/or owner shall post a bond with the Clerk-Treasurer in such
reasonable amount as shall be recommended by the Village Engineer and
determined by the Commission, based upon the anticipated cost of removal of the

1317.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to affirm the Village policy encouraging the
preservation and conservation of open space and to establish regulations
controlling the location, installation, maintenance and standards for fences in
order that a property owner may construct and maintain a fence which secures
privacy, offers attractive landscape design and/or affords security while
assuring that such fences are located and constructed so as to respect the
rights and enjoyment of neighboring property owners, preserving the integrity
of scenic zones, maintaining the appearance of the community, and securing the
overall health, safety and public welfare of the residents of the Village.

installation, maintenance and standards for new fences in all zoning districts
in the Village.
   (b)    Any fence erected prior to the date of the adoption of this section
which does not comply with these regulations shall be nonconforming. However,
such nonconformance shall not cause an order for removal. The Village may order
immediate remedial measures to alleviate or prevent any hazardous conditions
when the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such conditions,
whether conforming or nonconforming, jeopardize the health and safety of
residents, occupants, wildlife or domestic animals.
   (c)    Trellises, living fences, hedges and other living materials shall not
be deemed to constitute fences within the meaning of this chapter.
   (d)    All fences are hereby declared structures which require approval by
the Architectural Board of Review.

1325.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statement of Purposes. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   Lands to which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Waite Hill as identified in Section
 1325.01(d), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Village of Waite Hill.
(Ord. 2006-15. Passed 2-12-07.)
   (d)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For purposes
of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
and Flood Insurance Rate Map, Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and effective February 3,
2010, are hereby adopted.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
flood plain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the offices of the Village Engineer, CT Consultants,
35000 Kaiser Court, Willoughby, Ohio.
(Ord. 2009-22. Passed 12-14-09.)
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including but not limited to
subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant
or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations.
   (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer. The degree of flood protection required by
these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based
on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur
on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the
Village of Waite Hill, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
   (i)   Fee. The fees for administering this chapter shall be as follows:
      (1)   The minimum fee for review of a project which is the subject to
Chapter
1325 is two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   If the project to be reviewed is a subdivision, the minimum fee
shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) per lot.
      (3)   If the Flood Plain Administrator advises the Mayor that the
proposed project is complex and that the cost of administering the chapter will
exceed the amount payable under paragraphs A or B hereof, the Clerk Treasurer
of the Village shall collect a deposit in an amount estimated by the Flood
Plain Administrator to be sufficient to cover the cost of administering this
chapter. In the event the cost of administering this chapter exceeds the amount
of the deposit, the applicant shall file additional funds with the Clerk
Treasurer in such amount as is determined by the Flood Plain Administrator; in
the event the amount deposited with the Clerk Treasurer exceeds the cost of
administering this ordinance, the remaining deposit shall be refunded to the
applicant.
         (Ord. 2006-15. Passed 2-12-07.)
1325.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus eighteen inches (18”) of freeboard. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Waite Hill’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Waite Hill
Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated August 1, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as Areas of Special Flood
Hazard, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2006-15. Passed 2-12-07.)
1325.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Village Engineer is

apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1325.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (c)   Appeals.   
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Board of Zoning Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice of Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At the hearing of any appeal or request for
variance, the applicant shall present such statements and evidence as the
Appeals Board requires. In considering such matters, the Appeals Board shall
consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following
factors:
         (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1325.05(d)(3)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

1327.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)    Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)    Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technicallefotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)    Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village Engineer or Lake SWCD
is required for any one of the following conditions, as determined in Table 3
below:
         A.    Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.    10-acres of disturbed land.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area and have a
minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a drainage area over
5 acres.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1 000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
protection model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is divetted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets
and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each
one unit of width (>2: 1 length: width ratio), however a length to width ratio
of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment-settling pond
when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment control measures
in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily pending runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to I 0 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 >2% but <20%
0.125                                > 20% but <50%
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
   Based on site conditions, the Village Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD may
require additional best management practices to control off-site tracking and
dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.    Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.    Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1327.09(G) of this regulation.
         E.    Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD
may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed
areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and
regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to
disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
      (7)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)    Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)    Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)    Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)    Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)    Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)    Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)    Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)    Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the Village Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)    The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated too continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)    Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)    The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
      Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be
observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Waite Hill or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village Engineer. The inspection form shall
include:
         A.    The inspection date.
         B.    Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the.
inspection.
         C.    Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.    Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
         E.    Locations of:
            1.    Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.    BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.    BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.    Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
   (i)    Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation
of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be
followed:
      (1)    When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)    When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)    When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer and/or Lake SWCD. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site."

1329.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   "In order to preserve and protect the ecology and rural character of the
Village for the benefit of its citizens and surrounding communities", a goal
stated in the preamble of the Village Charter, Council hereby adopts the policy
that any person who wishes to develop property located in an ecologically
sensitive area bears the burden of demonstrating that the proposed development
will not adversely affect the ecology of the affected area, nor will such
development place an additional burden upon the ecology of neighboring
property.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.02 DEFINITION.
   Any designated area in the Village which, due to a unique or special
topography, soil type or hydrology or other ecologically relevant feature
which, if disturbed, may cause significant ecological harm to the developed
property or neighboring property shall be deemed an ecologically sensitive
area.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.03 ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS MAP AND STUDY.
   The following are hereby adopted as a part of this section to designate
ecologically sensitive areas within Waite Hill Village:
   (a)    Ecologically Sensitive Areas Map of Waite Hill Village dated May 8,

(Ord. 1997-14. Passed 7-14-97.)
1329.04 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)    Prior to disturbing, building on, grading, clear cutting, or
developing property in an ecologically sensitive area, the property owner or
his authorized representative must first obtain a permit from the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Such permit shall only be granted upon the presentation of
evidence that the proposed activity/development will not adversely impact the
ecologically sensitive area or any neighboring property. The person seeking the
permit shall have the burden of proof, by preponderance of the evidence, that
the proposed activity/development will have no adverse ecological impact.
   (b)    The Planning and Zoning Commission may conduct additional
investigations of the property and hear other evidence concerning the proposed
development and its ecological impact, separate from that evidence presented to
it by the property owner.
   (c)   In order to protect the ecologically sensitive area or any neighboring
property, the Planning and Zoning Commission may establish conditions and
require the permit holder to comply with such conditions. The permit shall list
the conditions established by the Planning and Zoning Commission and shall
state that the permit holder is required to comply with any conditions
established by the Planning and Zoning Commission and with all applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations.
   (d)   The Planning and Zoning Commission is authorized to revoke the permit
of a permit holder who fails to comply with any condition or requirement of the
permit or fails to adhere to any applicable federal, state or local laws and
regulations. If the permit holder’s permit application includes a Village
address, written notice of permit revocation shall be delivered to the permit
holder by the Police Department. If the permit holder’s permit application does
not include a Village address, written notice shall be forwarded to the permit
holder via certified mail. A notice of permit revocation shall state that the
permit holder has thirty (30) days from delivery of the notice to file an
appeal of the permit revocation with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2009-16. Passed 12-14-09.)
1329.05 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT: REQUIRED INFORMATION.
    (a)   Each application for a permit to be issued under this chapter shall
be made in writing on forms to be furnished by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   (b)    The application shall include a professionally prepared plan showing
existing site conditions, including water courses, natural features, existing
buildings and improvements, if any, and tree cover. The plans shall be
accurately drawn to scale of not less than one inch to fifty feet and shall
show all property lines of the lot, plot or parcel to which the application
relates.
   (c)    Each application shall be accompanied by a site improvement plan
which shall show proposed driveways, walks, grass and ground cover areas,
erosion and drainage control.
   (d)    Each application shall be accompanied by a topographic survey
prepared by a professional engineer or registered surveyor. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may determine that further study is desirable as to soil
conditions, subsurface water conditions, surface drainage, flood plain
elevations, construction or other conditions and that engineering or other
professional advice should be obtained. No permit shall be issued until such
topographic survey and other required studies have first been approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.06 DEPOSIT REQUIRED FOR CONSULTANTS.
   (a)    At the time of filing an application for a permit under this chapter
there shall be deposited with the Village in a special account, a fee to defray
Village expenses attendant to the review of the requested permits. The deposit
required hereunder shall be in accordance with the following schedules (a)(1)
and (2) hereof:
 
                                 Amount of
   Type of Proposal                         Deposit
(1)    All residential developments containing ten acres or less.       $ 500.00
The Mayor may initially waive such deposit on minor additions and small
developments if the land area is less than ten acres and if the Mayor
determines that the cost of professional consulting services and fees incurred
by the Village will be inconsequential when compared to the normal filing fee
required. However, if the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council requests
professional assistance in its study and review from the Village Engineer, the
Village Planner, the Village Architect and/or the Village Law Director, or
other consultants that may be required, then the applicant, upon notification
thereof, shall deposit five hundred dollars ($500.00) before further
consideration of the request.
 
(2)   All residential developments containing more than ten acres.    $1,000.00
   The deposits required by this section shall be in addition to the
requirements for fees required by the Village Code.
   (b)    Approval and Rate for Services. In the event professional consulting
services rendered by the Village Engineer, the Village Architect, Village
Planner and/or Law Director, or any outside consultants, or other expenses are
necessary as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Mayor or the
Council, the charges for such services shall be rendered at prevailing
contractual rates for such consulting services.
   (c)    Special Accounts Minimum Balance and Accounting. The Village Clerk-
Treasurer shall establish special accounts within the Village's funds on behalf
of such applicants, and upon authorization of the Mayor, the applicant shall
pay to the Village by way of reimbursement all charges and expenses incurred in
connection with the applicant's business before the -Planning and Zoning
Commission. Should an applicant’s special account have a balance of less than
twenty percent (20%) of the original deposit, the Mayor shall request in
writing that the applicant provide an additional deposit so that the balance
shall then equal the original required. In the event such request is approved
or disapproved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or withdrawn by the
applicant, any funds remaining in such special deposit account, after payment
of all lawful charges thereupon, shall immediately be returned to the
applicant. The Clerk-Treasurer shall furnish an accounting of charges to such
account at any reasonable time upon request of the applicant and upon final
dispersal.
   (d)    Failure to Post Deposit, Deposit Purpose.
      (1)    Upon the failure of any applicant to deposit funds to defray
municipal expenses, as required by this chapter, the Planning and Zoning
Commission or Council may dismiss any application unaccompanied by the required
deposit.
      (2)    Nothing herein shall obligate the Village to grant its approval of
an application or be construed as consideration therefor, but rather the
deposit shall serve the purpose that the Village shall continue to be governed
by its officials' informed and intelligent vote upon each specific appeal and
with the direction that such funds are to be applied to furnish the Village
with necessary technical data from professional municipal consultants when
requested or required by it on specific applications or to defray other
necessary administrative expenses regardless of the outcome of the final
disposition of the request or proposal of the applicant.
         (Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.07 NOTICE TO NEIGHBORING PROPERTY OWNERS.
   (a)    Any application for a permit made under this chapter shall specify
names and addresses of all abutting property owners and the names and addresses
of any neighboring property owners whose property may be affected by the
granting of such permit.
   (b)    The Clerk-Treasurer shall provide hearing notices to all parties
identified in the application, to any property owner identified by the Planning
and Zoning Commission as potentially being affected by the application for a
permit under this section, or to any other person who claims to be interested
in the application process.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.08 APPEALS.
   If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that insufficient evidence
has been presented to establish that the proposed development will not
adversely impact the developed property or other property, the applicant may
appeal the determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals within ten days of such
decision. If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that sufficient
evidence has been presented to establish that the proposed development will not
adversely impact the developed property or other property, any interested party
may appeal such determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall hold a formal public hearing and make conclusions of fact.
The determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final within the
Village and an appeal from the decision may be taken pursuant to law by any
interested party, including the Village.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)
1329.09 INJUNCTION.
   In addition to any other remedies provided by law, in the event of any
violation of this section or any imminent threat thereof, the Village may, by
its legal counsel, prosecute a suit in the Common Pleas Court of Lake County,
Ohio, to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent
injunction to prevent or terminate such violation or violations.
(Ord. 1995-7. Passed 6-12-95.)

violation of the provisions of this chapter occur or is permitted to occur and
any architect, engineer, contractor and/or subcontractor who is employed to

or fail to comply therewith or who shall conduct any development activity in an
ecologically sensitive area which activity or activities are not specifically
described in a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of Section
1329.04 shall be a misdemeanor of the first degree for each such failure or act
of noncompliance. Each day during which such violation shall occur or continue
shall constitute a separate offense.

1333.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to ensure safe operation of oil and gas wells
within the Municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted to
supplement any state issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil and
gas well within the Municipality. The provisions of this chapter are based upon
local conditions which may not be known to the State at the time such drilling
was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the Municipality to exercise its
local police authority, authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the protection of the
Municipality's residents and all emergency personnel who may be called upon to
respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 10-4-05.)
1333.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 10-4-05.)
1333.03 MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas (“Permit Holder”)
within the Village of Waite Hill, which permit has been issued by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources (“ODNR”), shall adhere to the following
regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the permit issued by ODNR shall be filed with the Police
Chief not less than ten (10) days before the commencement of any operations
preparatory to drilling in the Village. Upon receipt by the Police Chief, a
copy of such permit shall be delivered by the Police Chief to all owners and/or
occupants of all properties which adjoin the property where a well is to be
drilled.
   (b)   With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Police
Chief which identifies the owner(s) of the subject property where the well is
to be drilled by name and address, and identifies all persons, including but
not limited to the Permit Holder, who are responsible for the drilling and
operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a minimum, names,
mailing addresses and work telephone numbers.
   (c)   Plans for all wells, tank batteries, all excavation work (including
but not limited to boring pits) and all other site work shall be presented to
the Police Chief not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of any
drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of the site
and of all vehicular access to the site from any public right of way.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred feet (500) of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g. fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g. a playground) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure, or facilities, or occupants, or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Police Chief prior to the
commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the Permit
Holder is insured by a solvent insurer, licensed to do business in the State of
Ohio, with limits of three million dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence for
personal injury and property damage.
   (h)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Police Chief prior to the
commencement of drilling. Such information shall be immediately updated upon
any change of circumstance.
   (i)   In accordance with Ohio law, the Permit Holder shall do all of the
following:
      (1)   Remove all bore pits, and all well spoils from the subject
property; and
      (2)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of
the site to its previous elevation; and
      (3)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover, and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (4)   Notify the Police Chief that the site has been restored pursuant to
the terms of this paragraph. The Police Chief (or his designee) shall inspect
the site within five (5) days of the notification to ensure that no grading of
the property has occurred which materially alters the drainage of the subject
property in a manner which is inconsistent with the drainage of the property
prior to the commencement of any ground moving activities performed pursuant to
the ODNR permit.
   (j)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and plugging of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from access to the
greatest extent possible, in a manner consistent with ODNR regulations.
   (k)   Within six (6) months after the drilling operations have been
completed, the Permit Holder shall plant sufficient vegetation which, in
conjunction with any fencing and natural vegetation, shall effectively and
permanently screen all above-ground facilities from all neighbors and from all
public and private rights of way, while such facilities are on the subject
premises. The Police Chief shall determine the sufficiency of the screening and
may order the Permit Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Police Chief at least forty-eight
(48) hours notice before commencing to drill.
   (m)   The Permit Holder shall file a cash bond with the Police Chief in
accordance with the following provisions.
      (1)   A cash bond of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per well shall be
filed with the Police Chief to ensure the installation and maintenance of
sufficient fencing and screening of facilities, as provided herein, and also to
secure the repair or replacement of any Village owned infrastructure (e.g.
roads and culverts) which may be damaged by any activity related to oil and gas
production, including but not limited to the transportation of equipment or
materials used in any manner for oil and gas production, or for the plugging of
a well.
       (2)   No Permit Holder shall be required to file more than four (4) cash
bonds, totaling twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), which shall be deemed to be
a “blanket bond” for all additional wells drilled in the Village.
      (3)   Fencing and screening shall be installed and maintained in a manner
which accomplishes the intended goal of screening and securing the facilities.
      (4)   In the event the Village is required to utilize the bond to
install, maintain or repair the facilities which are secured by said bond, the
Permit Holder shall file with the Village sufficient funds to restore the bond
to its original amount.
      (5)   Any bond filed with the Village shall be held until such time as
all equipment has been removed from the site of the oil and gas production
facilities, the well is plugged and the site has been appropriately restored,
as required by state law. The municipality shall return the bond upon the
restoration of the site, upon the determination by the Police Chief that the
interests to be secured by the bond are no longer at risk.
   (n)   Notwithstanding Section
509.08 of these Codified Ordinances, drilling operations may occur twenty four
hours per day until the permitted depth is reached.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the state issued permit, or any state statute or
ODNR regulation.
   (p)   The Police Chief or his designee shall, within two (2) business days
of receipt of the plans pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, review said plans
and immediately advise the Permit Holder if anything shown on the plans does
not comply with the regulations set forth herein.
   (q)   In the event that any Permit Holder fails to comply with the
regulations herein promulgated, the Chief of Police, shall provide written
notice to the owner of the property and the Permit Holder within forty eight
(48) hours of the discovery of such failure to comply. Such service shall be
made to the addresses identified in paragraph (b) hereof, and if no address has
been provided, to any address identified on the permit issued by the State of
Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the Permit Holder that if they wish
to appeal the decision of the administrative official, the time for appeal is
five (5) days after service of the notice.
      (Ord. 2007-6. Passed 4-9-07.)
1333.04 APPEAL.
   Any determination of the Chief of Police, in applying the regulations
promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any owner of property
or any Permit Holder may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission by
filing a notice of appeal with the Chief of Police within five (5) days of
notification by the Chief of Police that the permit holder has not complied
with the regulation. The appeal shall be heard at the next Planning and Zoning
Commission meeting, but such further hearings may be held as required for the
