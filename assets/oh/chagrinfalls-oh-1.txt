EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of

ARTICLE III
MAYOR
   SECTION III-1. TERM.
   The Mayor shall be elected at the regular Municipal election held in the

duties, the President of Council shall become the acting Mayor, and while so
acting shall have and exercise all of the powers of the Mayor, but shall not
thereby cease to be the President of Council. In the event the President of

at the organization meeting following such regular Municipal election shall
become Mayor for that portion of the term as provided above. The election for
Mayor for the balance of the remaining term, when the office of Mayor becomes
vacant, shall be held at the next general election which is more than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the office of Mayor becomes vacant.

Charter, or by any ordinance or resolution of the Council or by the laws of the
State of Ohio.
   Subject to the provisions of this Charter and the provisions of the civil

not approve it, it shall be returned to Council within said ten days with the
Mayor's written objections by delivery to the Clerk of Council, which
objections shall be entered in full on the journal of the Council. If the Mayor
does not sign or so return an ordinance or resolution within said ten-day
period, it shall take effect in the same manner as if the Mayor had signed it.
The Mayor may approve or disapprove the whole or any item of an ordinance or
resolution appropriating money, but otherwise the Mayor's approval or
disapproval shall be addressed to the entire ordinance or resolution. When the
Mayor has disapproved an ordinance or resolution, or a part or item thereof as
herein provided, the Council shall not later than its next regular meeting,
proceed to reconsider it, and if upon reconsideration the ordinance or
resolution or part or item thereof disapproved by the Mayor be approved by the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of Council, it shall

separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one
instrument. Each part shall contain in the case of the initiative or
referendum, a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed or
referred ordinance or resolution, and in the case of the recall, the name and
office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than
200 words of the grounds for the proposed removal. The manner of signing, the
method of circulating, the form and requirements as to the affidavit, and the
other requirements of the general laws of the State of Ohio regulating
initiative and referendum petitions, shall apply in the case of initiative,
referendum and recall in this Municipality, except as otherwise provided in
this Charter.
   (b)   Within thirty (30) days after the final passage by Council and
approval by the Mayor of an Ordinance or Resolution, that was not adopted as an
emergency ordinance, a referendum petition signed by at least that number of
electors which equals ten percent (10%) of the electors voting at the last
preceding general municipal election, may be filed with the Clerk of Council,
requesting that such ordinance or resolution be either repealed or submitted to
a vote of electors. If the referendum petition is filed, the Clerk of Council
shall first ascertain the sufficiency of the petition, and if found sufficient,
the Council shall thereupon, within thirty (30) days of the filing of such
petition, reconsider such ordinance or resolution. If, upon such
reconsideration, the ordinance or resolution is not repealed, the Council shall
submit it to a vote of the electors at the first primary or general election in
any year occurring more than ninety (90) days after the Council determines that
it will not repeal the ordinance or resolution. No such ordinance or resolution
shall go into effect until approved by a majority of those voting thereon.
   (c) Ordinances and resolutions providing for a tax levy or for improvements
petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the front footage of the property
benefited and to be specially assessed therefor, and appropriation ordinances
and resolutions, limited to the subject of appropriations, shall not be subject
to referendum. Further, whenever the Council is required to pass more than one
ordinance, resolution or other action to complete the financing and assessment
of the cost of any public improvement previously finally approved, only the
first resolution, ordinance or other action relating to said financing and
assessment shall be subject to referendum, and any subsequent resolution,
ordinance or other action relating to the financing and assessment of the cost
of said public improvement, as previously finally approved, shall not be
subject to referendum.
   (d)   Any Ordinance adopted to certify an initiative to the Board of
Elections to be considered by the electors shall not be subject to referendum.
   (e)    Ordinances and other measures may be proposed by initiative petition
and adopted by election, in the manner now or hereinafter provided by the
Constitution or the laws of Ohio, except that ordinances proposed by initiative
petition to amend the Planning and Zoning Code and/or the Zoning Map of the
Municipality shall be subject to the procedures, process, review certification
of the Board of Elections and other requirements contained in
Section X of this Charter, and only in the event that this Charter is silent on
a matter, or there is no conflict with this Charter, in accordance with the
laws of Ohio. It is hereby declared that in the event of a conflict between the
Charter and the Ohio Revised Code, and as permitted by the home rule powers
granted to municipalities, and the Ohio Revised Code and in particular Ohio
Revised Code Section 731.41, the manner, means, method, consideration and
placement on the ballot of initiatives shall be governed by this Charter.
   (f)   This section shall be severable and if any subsection, paragraph,
part, word or application thereof is held invalid for any reason, such holding
shall not invalidate or affect the force and effect of any other subsection,
paragraph, part, word or application thereof.
   (g)   After the petitioners have submitted their initiative petitions to the
Clerk of Council, and upon completion of circulation within the Municipality,
the Clerk of Council shall submit such petitions to the Board of Elections to
determine if there are sufficient valid signatures of electors of the
Municipality. The Board of Elections shall certify whether such petitions
contain the signatures of not less than ten (10%) of the number of electors who
voted at the last preceding general municipal election in the Municipality. In
the event such initiative petitions do not contain sufficient signatures to
meet or exceed ten percent (10%) of the number of electors that voted in the
last preceding general municipal election, the petitioners may seek additional
signatures of electors of the Municipality.
   (h)   Once the initiative petitions are certified by the Board of Elections
to have not less than ten percent (10%) of the number of electors voting at the
last preceding general municipal election, the initiative shall be placed on
the agenda for the next regular Council meeting. At the first regular Council
meeting at which the initiative is considered, a public hearing before Council
shall be set with at least ten (10) days advance notice. The notice shall
conform to the requirements for notification of public hearings whenever any
amendment to the Planning and Zoning Code and/or Zoning Map of the Municipality
is being proposed as provided in the Planning and Zoning Code of the
Municipality. Public hearings shall be held at a regular Council meeting.
(Amended 11-2-21)
   SECTION X-4. REZONING-REFERENDUM.
   Any ordinance which provides for a change in the existing Municipal Zoning
Map or which otherwise provides for a change in the use of property from the
uses presently authorized by the existing Municipal Zoning Map, including
municipally owned or controlled property, shall be subject to referendum by
submission to the electors of the Municipality upon the filing with the
Municipal Clerk of a petition signed by not less than five percent (5%) of the
number of electors who voted for Governor at the most recent general election
for the office of Governor in the Municipality within thirty (30) days after
the ordinance shall have been filed with the Mayor, or in case the Mayor has
vetoed the Ordinance within thirty (30) days after Council has passed the
ordinance over a veto; the Municipal Clerk shall certify the text of the
ordinance to the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections for submission to the
electors of the Municipality for rejection or approval at the next succeeding
general, primary or special election in the Municipality.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

which: (i) provides for an expenditure in excess of fifty thousand dollars
($50,000); and, (ii) is for the construction of a public improvement or the

service to the Village, shall be authorized only upon a motion, adopted by a
majority vote of the members of Council, to award the contract to the lowest
and best bidder after advertising for a time and in a manner that the Village
determines shall be effective in notifying a sufficient number of bidders as
determined by the Village in its discretion. By way of example, and not as a
limitation, the advertisement may be in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Village, or publication on the Village's website, or both.
   (e)   Exceptions to Public Bidding. Contracts whose costs are estimated to
exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and that meet the following conditions
are not subject to competitive bidding and may be approved by Council, in its
discretion, by motion and a majority vote of its members:
      (1)   Personal or Professional Services. Except as provided in Section
105.02, contracts that involve personal services requiring unique and special
skills, as determined by Council in its discretion, or professional services;
      (2)   Co-op Programs. Contracts authorized pursuant to the Ohio
Department of Administrative Services Cooperative Purchasing Program, or any
other similar program ("cooperative program"), or goods, materials or equipment
which are available under a cooperative program but are available to the
Village upon equivalent or better conditions and specifications, but at a lower
price than is available, under a cooperative program;
      (3)   Design Build. The proposed purchase is a Design-Build Construction
project let under the procedures established by Council;
      (4)   Construction-Manager-at-Risk. The proposed purchase is a
Construction-Manager-at-Risk project let under the procedures established by
Council;
      (5)   Single source. The proposed purchase is for something that, as
determined at the sole discretion of the Council, is only available from a
single source;
      (6)   No Bids/Rejected Bids. If no bids are received after the
advertisements or other solicitations required by this chapter, or if all bids
are rejected, the Mayor shall either seek new, competitive bids, or seek to
obtain the goods and/or services for which funds have been appropriated without
re-bidding, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the Village;
      (7)   Used Equipment. The proposed purchase is for used equipment;
      (8)   Utilities. The proposed purchase is for utilities such as gas,
water, electricity, cable, data transmission, or telephone service for which
funds have been appropriated; notwithstanding other provisions of this section,
Council shall authorize such purchases pursuant to an ordinance;
      (9)   Intergovernmental Purchases. The proposed purchase is from or with
another political subdivision, the Ohio State Government, or the United States
Government;
      (10)   Reverse Auction. The proposed purchase is obtained through Reverse
Auction;
      (11)   Best Interest Waiver. Council may, at its sole discretion, waive
the public bidding requirement if it determines that doing so is in the best
interest of the Village.
   (f)   Mayor's Discretionary Spending Authority. The Mayor may expend up to
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), in accordance with the Village's current
appropriations, for any public improvement, or the purchase or lease of
equipment, materials and supplies, or to obtain professional or personal
services or for any other lawful purpose. The Mayor shall notify Council of
such expenditure at the next meeting of Council.
   (g)   Time Between Notice of Public Bidding and Bid Opening. There shall be
no minimum time requirement between the publishing of the notice of public
bidding and the opening of the bids.
   (h)   Estimate of Cost. The Village shall disclose the estimated cost of the
project when it determines that doing so is in its best interest.
   (i)   Time for Award of Bids. In the notice of public bidding required for
the bid solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit after bid
submission for awarding a contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during
this period. The Village's failure to award and execute the contract within
this period invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted,
unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual
consent of the Village and the bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with
respect to whom the Village subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such
an agreed extension shall not entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (j)   Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant Section 9.31 of
the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the Village's right
to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (k)   Bids in Excess of Estimate. The Village may award contracts regardless
of the amount of the bid as compared to the estimated cost.
   (l)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to
proceed with the work by the Village or its representative upon execution of
the contract. The Village shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time
that it determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract
for its convenience.
   (m)   Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the contractor
at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage shall not be
held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such times and in
such amounts as the Village determines to be equitable.
   (n)   General Contractor Permitted. The Village may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
   (o)   Extension of Bid Opening. The Village may issue an addendum or addenda
modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for the bid
opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued within
forty-eight hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be extended by
at least three days.
   (p)   Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The Village at its
discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (q)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a bonus
for completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.

approval of the Village, as evidenced by legislative approval enacted by the

(Ord. 2023-37. Passed 7-24-23.)
   107.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The Village welcomes unrestricted Donations as well as Restricted
Donations that enhance Village services, reduce costs that the Village would
incur in the absence of the Donation, or that otherwise provide a benefit to
the Village.
   (b)   The Village may decline any Donation without comment or cause.
   (c)   Prior to starting any fundraising on behalf of the Village, or prior

Fundraising plan for the Supported Fundraising.
   (h)   Donations must be directly related to providing goods or services to
the public or for another valid public purpose.
(Ord. 2023-37. Passed 7-24-23.)
   107.04  GUIDELINES FOR CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RECEIVE RESTRICTED AND
UNRESTRICTED DONATIONS.
   In determining whether to accept a Donation, the Chief Administrative
Officer, or Village
Council, as the case may be, shall consider the following criteria:
   (a)   Is the Donation permitted under applicable ethics laws, rules, and
regulations.
   (b)   Does a Restricted Donation conflict with Village priorities, policies,
programs, or ordinances.
   (c)   Does the Donation in any way invoke future consideration, influence,
or perceive to influence the day-to-day operations of the Village.

be able to fund any future maintenance, repair or replacement associated with

Donation or project implementation, including installation and ongoing

   107.05 ACCEPTANCE OF REAL ESTATE DONATIONS.
   (a)   Gifts of real estate may include developed or undeveloped property or
gifts subject to a life interest or reversionary right. Whenever Donations are

required, and the results of the Phase I Assessment must first be approved by
the Village Law Director. In addition, the Village Council shall approve all
Donations of real estate and in the case of nonresidential property, shall
approve the environmental condition of the property before the Donation will be
accepted. The cost of any environmental impact assessment shall be paid for by
the Donor.
   (b)   The Village shall obtain a Title Insurance Commitment the cost of
which shall be determined between the Donor and the Village. The Village Law
Director shall approve the condition of title before a Donation of real
property will be accepted. The Donor must provide the Village with all
available documents related to the condition of the property upon written
request of the Village before a Donation of real property will be accepted.
   (c)   In considering whether to accept a Donation of real property, the
Village Council shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Is the property free from adverse environmental conditions.
      (2)   Is the property marketable and is the title acceptable to the Law
Director.
      (3)   Does the Village have a use for the real property and is it
accessible and useable by Village residents or the Village government.
      (4)   Are there any restrictions, reservations, easements, or other
limitations associated with the use or sale of the property.
      (5)   Are there any carrying costs associated with the property other
than insurance, such as storage fees, liens, mortgages, or other carrying
costs.
      (6)   The Village may accept royalties from oil, gas, and other mineral
interests when the gift is separated from ownership of the real property. The
right to receive the royalties shall not include liabilities or other
considerations that make receiving the gift inappropriate.
      (7)   The donated property cannot negatively affect public access or
Village Services.
      (8)   Is the property located within the Village, or any area outside the
Village that is serviced by a Village supplied sewer and/or water service.
         (Ord. 2023-37. Passed 7-24-23.)
   107.06  PROCEDURES.

unrestricted Donations of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less in cash. The
Village Council shall approve or reject Donations of cash of more than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this
Donation Policy. The Chief Administrative Officer and Council may decline any
Donation which in their discretion does not comply with this Donation Policy.
Any Donation declined by the Chief Administrative Officer may be appealed to
the Village Council for reconsideration.
   
   (b)   The Village Council will determine appropriate recognition for a
Donation at the time the Donation is accepted, taking into consideration the
nature and value of the Donation. The name of a Donor, but no company logos,
trademarks or the like, may be permitted on a sign, flyer or other materials
related to the program or activity supported by the Donations. The agreed upon
form of recognition shall be identified in the Donor receipt or in any Donation
Agreement that only the Village Council shall approve when reviewing whether to
accept or decline a Donation.
   (c)   Established Fundraising for existing Village Donation programs shall
not require Village Council approval unless in the opinion of the Chief
Administrative Officer and/or Village Council the methods or targets of the
Fundraising change in a material way.
(Ord. 2023-37. Passed 7-24-23.)
   107.07 PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   No Village employee shall receive under any pretense, or seek, ask, or
share in any fee, reward or other reimbursement or gratuity for the performance
of official duties.
   (b)   This prohibition shall apply equally to the receipt or solicitation by
the employee’s spouse, child, parent, parent-in-law, brother, sister,
grandparent, or grandchild.
   (c)   Whenever any gift, gratuity or Donation is offered to a Village
employee and the Village employee cannot determine if acceptance would be
prohibited or permitted, the employee shall submit the proposal through their
Department Head to the Chief Administrative Officer who may consult with the
Village Law Director. The proposal must include a description of the gift, the
name of the Donor, when the gift will be received, and an explanation of the
proposed disposition of the gift. The decision of the Chief Administrative
Officer as to whether the gift is permitted or prohibited shall be final.
Approval from the Village Council shall be required whenever any gift is
offered to a Department Head, the Chief Administrative officer, or an elected
official.
   (d)   The prohibitions above shall not apply to solicitation or acceptance
of anything of value from an existing friend or relative unrelated to any
employee duties or Village business and based on a pre-existing personal or
family relationship.
(Ord. 2023-37. Passed 7-24-23.)
   107.08 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (a)   This Donation Policy shall not be construed to create any right for an
individual or organization to make a Donation to the Village or to make a
public improvement on Village property.
   (b)   The Village reserves the right to deny any Donation if, upon review,
acceptance of the Donation is determined to be not in the best interest of the
Village.
   (c)   The Village, in accepting any Donation, shall not be obligated to
maintain, repair, or replace any program, facility or service created,
maintained, or enhanced by the Donation.
   (d)   The Village will not stipulate the value of any property donated to
the Village and it shall be the obligation of the Donor to determine such value
for tax purposes. The Village will file IRS Form 8282, or its future
equivalent, in the event of future sale or exchange of donated real property
made within three (3) years from the date of the gift for any property that the
Village determines to have a value of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more,
or such other requirements hereafter established by the U.S. Congress in
amending the Internal Revenue Code.

   124.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.  
     The income tax levied by the Municipality at a rate of one and eighty-five
hundredths percent (1.85%) is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every
person residing in and/or earning and/or receiving income in the Municipality.
 
Individuals.
   
   (A)   For residents of the Municipality, the income tax levied herein shall
be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
124.02 (C)(16)).
      (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to
"Municipal Taxable Income" as defined in Section
124.02 (C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
124.02 (C)(12).
Refundable credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (D)   (1)   As used in this division:
                  (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a
compensation plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
                  (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
                  (c)    (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax
rate for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the
Municipality with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
                     (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different
taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those
different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to
the Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
                  (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of Municipal
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (2)    If, in addition to the Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax
to other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to
the extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
                  (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                  (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled
in the Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year
or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is
domiciled in the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
                  (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile
described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
            (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is
domiciled in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that
may be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

                  (d)    The location of real estate for which the individual
claimed a property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the
individual's residence or domicile;
                  (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by
the individual;
                  (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
                  (g)    The primary location at which the individual is

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
                  (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with
the Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one
"contact period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from
the individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away
overnight from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of
each of two consecutive days in the Municipality.
            (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules
and Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
            (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of
this section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within
and without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
                  (a)    The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average
original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
                  (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
124.04 (C);
                  (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession
from sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
the Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during
the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
            (2)    (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division
(F)(1) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's
business activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
                      (i)    Separate accounting;
                     (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
                     (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors
that would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer
to the municipal corporation;
                     (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
                  (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
124.12 (A).
                  (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
124.12 (A).
                  (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies
or otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
            (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages,
salaries, and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other
compensation paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following
locations:
                  (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by,
rented to, or under the possession of one of the following:
                     (i)    The employer;
                     (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the
employer, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
                     (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a
person described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such
a vendor, customer, client, or patient.
                  (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                  (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator
determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at
the other location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or
(b) of this section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal
income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
            (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
except as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
          (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if regardless of where title
passes the property meets either of the following criteria:
                     (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
                     (ii)    The property is delivered within the Municipality
from a location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
                  (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be
sitused to the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in
the Municipality.
                  (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
the sale of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
                  (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
rents and royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be
sitused to the Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
            (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only
if the property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if
the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
               (6)    (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or
broker relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused
to the municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit
reported by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the
Municipality, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent
or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
the Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease
of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
                  (b)   An individual who is a resident of the Municipality
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a
credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance.
                (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1)
of this section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
               (8)    Intentionally left blank.
               (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this Chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting Location" means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
124.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
             (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records.
A taxpayer may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an
employee or owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
124.04 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18; Ord. 2023-72. Passed 11-13-23.)
   124.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.   
Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Effective January 1, 2017, each employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located or doing business in the Municipality shall withhold an
income tax from the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in
the Municipality. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not
required under Section
124.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
124.01 of this chapter, of one and eighty-five hundredths percent (1.85%). An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.
                  (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following
the last day of each calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
       (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
            (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold Municipal Income Tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
           (5)    (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax
by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
withhold the tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's,
or other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                  (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
            (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject
to a Municipal income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
            (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
            (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                  (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
                  (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                  (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for
which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during
the preceding calendar year;
                  (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
                  (e) Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
             (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
            (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
            (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work"
means the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to
report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee
is not required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis
to a fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
(d)    "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services in a
professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.
                  (e)    "Professional entertainer" means a person who performs
services in the professional performing arts for wages or other remuneration on
a per-event basis.
                  (f)    "Public figure" means a person of prominence who
performs services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or
similar events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
                  (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does
not include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), and (6) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the
Municipality if the employee performed such services in the Municipality on
twenty (20) or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following
conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
                     (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more
presumed worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this
division, "presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or
provided services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the
employer to last more than twenty (20) days in a calendar year. Services can
"reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20) days" if
either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
                           (a)    The nature of the services is such that it
will require more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the
services;
                           (b)    The agreement between the employer and its
customer to perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the
services at the location for more than twenty (20) days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
124.04.
                     (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid
for the performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional
athlete, professional entertainer, or public figure.
                  (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this
section, an employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing
services in the Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing
services for or on behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
                     (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee
will first perform services for the employer for the day;
                     (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee
was performing services for the employer to any other location;
                     (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location
in order to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery,
property that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired,
refurbished, processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
                     (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in
division (C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the
property, the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property
to real estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
                     (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee
makes the employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the
employee's principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not
perform services for the employer.
            (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)    (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold,
the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
                  (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Municipality under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Municipality for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
            (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
 124.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
            (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply
to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
124.04. (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A) An annual Municipal income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
            (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all
nonresident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer under Section
124.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Municipality.
            (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Municipal
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
    (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (E)   The Municipality shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
              (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or in
the case of a return or a request required by a qualified municipal
corporation, Ohio Form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any
other documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended
return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this
section electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the
foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.
               (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not
an individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net
profit return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of
only the following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form
1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and,
with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
               (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax
Administrator may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information,
statements, or documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify
the taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
  
    (G)    (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Municipality. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
                  (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
annual net profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality. No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
              (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth (10th) month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after
January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the Municipal income tax return for a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the
eleventh (11th) month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
                  (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
                  (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Municipal income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
            (3)    If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the
Municipality's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
            (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
       (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
            (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of
this section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of
this section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
the Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) of this section apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Municipality income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
               (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
124.04(C)(1)(g)) within Municipality.
               (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Municipality
and does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for the taxable
year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Municipality, make any sales in Municipality, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Municipality during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Municipality for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Municipality income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
and tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment; for purposes of this
section, "receiving that payment" refers to the transfer of funds from the
account of the taxpayer since such funds are no longer under the control of the
taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
124.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality , unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and any of the Municipality's ordinances,
resolutions, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file a Municipal
income tax return, estimated Municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a Municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of Municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty
(180) days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one
hundred eightieth (180th) day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates.
An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
    (O)    (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
            (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first (181st) day after the applicant's active duty or service
terminates.
            (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
            (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
 
    (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
            (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return
election period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for
a five (5) year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
       (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Municipal income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
‘
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
124.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
            (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
124.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
            (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
                (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
124.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
                  (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss
in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
124.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
            (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
                  (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal
income tax return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y)
of Section
124.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
                  (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
124.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter on
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
    (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

    (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject
to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed seventy-five
percent (75%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR
the tax rate imposed under this Chapter.
   
   (B)   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
  
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
    (A)   As used in this section:
            (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Municipality's
income tax for the current taxable year.
            (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the
Municipality for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
          (a)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the Municipality in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
            (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations
of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
            (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (G) of Section
124.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
            (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.

increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
                  (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth
month after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5%)
percent of the tax liability for the taxable year;
                  (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth
(6th) month after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45%) percent
of the tax liability for the taxable year;
                  (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth
(9th) month after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half
(67.5) percent of the tax liability for the taxable year;
                 (d)    For an individual on or before the fifteenth (15th) day
of the first (1st) month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual,

taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
             (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
            (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th)
month of the year following that for which the declaration or amended
declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which
may be due shall be paid with the return in accordance with Section
124.05.
   
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
124.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
                  (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                  (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year,
forty-five percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
                  (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year,
sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

            (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   
   (E) An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
            (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
            (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Municipality under Section
124.05 for that year.
            (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality but was not domiciled there on the first (1st) day of January of
the calendar year that includes the first (1st) day of the taxable year.
                  (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
     (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in Section
124.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
            (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
            (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
            (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
124.21.
   
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
            (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
            (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such
last day.
            (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven (7) days of the last day for making the request.
   
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
124.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
    (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on refunds.
   
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by
Municipality. If the Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   
   (C)   If the Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality's tax rate. However, if the Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
    (A)    (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
            (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
    (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
                  (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if
all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
                  (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil
actions or prosecutions under Section
 124.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
 124.09.
            (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of
refund that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments
were reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be
reopened to determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal income tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipal income tax return
showing income subject to Municipal income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional Municipal income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of
any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten ($10.00)
dollars.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.12 LIMITATIONS.
    (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                    (i)    Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return
was filed, whichever is later; or
                     (ii)    One (1) year after the conclusion of the
qualifying deferral period, if any.

this section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
            (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means
a period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                  (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
124.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                  (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the
date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final
or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,

of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
 124.09.
  
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, or the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
124.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
124.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
            (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
            (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
                  (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.13 AUDITS. 
    (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
      (A)    As used in this section:
            (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
             (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the
postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the
ORC is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when
the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or
accept the assessment.
   
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
                  (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipal
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60)
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
            (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   
    (D)    (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty (20%) percent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
            (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within
sixty (60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
Municipal official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
    (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
    (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or

   124.17 FRAUD.
      No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the
preparation or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document authorized or required by Municipal ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

subject to the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January
1, 2016, of the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment

   124.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.

   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
                  (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this

the Municipality's income tax ordinance;

            (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the

            (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
            (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
124.18.
                  (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a)
and (b) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax
or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
124.99 for a violation of Section
124.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

subject to appeal. (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)

exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
            (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of
Tax Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason,
the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the
member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of
Tax Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall
be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax

sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or

appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.

days after the first (1st) day of the hearing unless the parties agree
otherwise.
   
   (E)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax

Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal

as provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   
   (F)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section

5703. of the Revised Code.
   
   (B)    (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the

form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the
third month of any taxable year.
                     (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the
election, the taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the Tax Commissioner by law, the Tax Commissioner may:

           (2)    Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to
carry out those sections;
            (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry
out the duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   
   (D)    The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a Tax Administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
124.02 of the Municipality Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.28 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances.
    As used in sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances only:
      (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to
the municipal corporation under section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
      (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code and section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
            (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
            (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income
deducted under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
            (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
            (4)    (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this
section, deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the
extent the income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
                  (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to
the extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or
1250 of the Internal Revenue Code.
            (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a
deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
            (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
            (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
            (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
            (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned
directly or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal
taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net
profit in the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)
(b) of section
124.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
            (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned

taxable income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
124.33 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (48)(b) of section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (48)(b)of section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
      (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
124.02 of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
      (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports
required to be filed pursuant to sections
124.27 to
 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
      (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal
year ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which
the calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based
pursuant to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal
income tax purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
 124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
      (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
    124.29 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under section
 124.27 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
               (1)    The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average
original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
               (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section
124.04(C) of the Codified Ordinances;
            (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (B)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner
may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
                  (a)    Separate accounting;
                  (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
                  (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that
would provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to
the municipal corporation;
                  (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
            (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of
section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
            (3)    The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by division (A) of section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
             (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented
to, or under the possession of one of the following:
                  (a)    The employer;
                  (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the
employer, or a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
                 (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
            (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
            (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
      (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
            (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
                  (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
                  (b)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from
a location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
           (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the
sale of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
            (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused
to the Municipality.
             (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
       (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to
the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
Municipality in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon
the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the Municipality to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
      (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section
 124.02 of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
      (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

124.27 of the Codified Ordinances. The Tax Administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

the basis for the referral.
            (2)    If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer
referred by the Tax Administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves
its right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to
ensure that the correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before
the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's

            (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one

            (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Commissioner

   (D)    (1)    (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic

automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the Tax
Commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
                  (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request
that the Tax Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date
for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Tax Commissioner
receives the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
due, the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
                  (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of
this section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
            (2)    If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to
ensure payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
124.01 and
124.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the Tax Commissioner may require taxpayers
to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning
questions that arise during the examination or other review of the return and
authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the Tax Commissioner
with information that is missing from the return, to contact the Tax
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Commissioner and has shown to the preparer
or other person.
   
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

             (5)    When an election made under section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
   
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
 
      (E)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and
(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
124.28 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
             (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make
any adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
124.28 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
             (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
at least eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
                (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss
from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for
the purpose of making the computations required in section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
                (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
 124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
             (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
 124.29 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
                (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
124.29 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.34  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.35 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
      (A)    As used in this section:
             (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a
taxpayer's income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state
for a taxable year.
             (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the
current taxable year.
   
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
             (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a
declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
             (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable
year or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
             (4)    The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
    (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with,
and remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the
amounts prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be
made payable to the treasurer of state.
              (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
                   (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of
the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of
the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
                   (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month
of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
             (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of
estimated taxes will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for
the taxable year, the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its
subsequent payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment
of estimated taxes.
             (3)    (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of
estimated taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that
it owes to each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
                   (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under
this section, the Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the
treasurer of state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner
as in division (B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there
shall be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of
underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to
reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of
the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
                   (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                   (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year,
forty-five per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                  (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year,
sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the
amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                   (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year,
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment.
              (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
             (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be
considered as taxes collected under sections
124.27 to
 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
             (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable
year, determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the
end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
             (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least one hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a municipal income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.36 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
      (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
             (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-
five dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a
month elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and
the date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance,
under this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
             (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically
under sections
 124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the Tax Commissioner may
impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
                   (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of
the amount required to be reported on the return;
                   (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per
cent of the amount required to be reported on the return.
             (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty equal
to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
             (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return
required by sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
 124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
             (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the
reporting or payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required
under sections
 124.27 to
 124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
             (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a
refund under section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.37 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Tax Commissioner's
possession.
The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer
more than three (3) years after the later of the date the return subject to
assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time
limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Tax Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The Tax
Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the Tax
Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty (60) days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or
by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Tax Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under
section 5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the Tax Commissioner issues the assessment until
the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Tax Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Tax Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in
section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry
with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance
with division (B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory
to the Tax Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not
prejudice the Tax Commissioner's consideration of the petition for
reassessment.
  
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.38  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
      (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner within three (3) years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   
   (B)    (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of
budget and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax
refund fund created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is
greater than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
             (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Tax
Commissioner shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to
the taxpayer attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be
deducted from the municipal corporation's next distribution under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
   
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.39  AMENDED RETURNS.
      (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments
required in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election
allowed under section
124.27 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Tax Commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
124.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
124.38 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.40  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
      (A)    The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the Tax Commissioner or
a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax
Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
124.27 to
124.41 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The
person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division
does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2018-22. Passed 3-26-18.)
   124.41 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (A)    Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever
recklessly violates division (A) of section
 124.31 of the Codified Ordinances shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars or imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.
   (B)    Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of division (A) of
section

which shall be available in active deposits to:

   (b)   The Director of Finance shall recommend, and Council, by ordinance,

charges, if any, that will be made for its services, other terms or conditions
with respect to the depository's acceptance of all or part of the
Municipality's active deposits and the location of its offices in the
Municipality or, if none are located in the Municipality, the location of its

   125.03 COLLATERAL SECURITIES.
   As used in this chapter, "collateral securities" means securities maturing
within five years from the date of their pledge and includes the following:
   (a)   Bonds, notes or other direct obligations of the United States of
America, or bonds, notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the United States of America or those for which the faith of the
United States of America is pledged for the payment of principal and interest
thereon, by language appearing in the instruments specifically providing such
guarantee of pledge and not merely by interpretation or otherwise.
   (b)    Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued by
any Federal Government agency, or the Export-Import Bank of Washington, bonds,
notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
United States of America or those for which the faith of the United States of
America is pledged for the payment of principal and interest therein, by
interpretation or otherwise and not by language appearing in the instruments
specifically providing such guarantee or pledge,
   (c)    Bonds and other obligations of this State and of any county,
township, school district, municipal corporation or other legally constituted
taxing subdivision of this State, which is not at the time of such deposit in

obligations and for which the full faith and credit of the issuing subdivision
is pledged;
   (d)    Bonds of other states of the United States of America for which the
full faith and credit of the state is pledged, which states have not during the
ten years immediately preceding the time of such deposit defaulted in payments
of either interest or principal on any of their bonds.
      (Ord.1986-46. Passed 10-28-86.)
   125.04 PLEDGED COLLATERAL SECURITIES.
   All public moneys deposited in eligible depositories shall be secured by
collateral securities pledged at market value in an amount equal to at least
one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the public moneys deposited less
any amount covered by Federal Deposit Insurance.
   Any collateral securities pledged pursuant hereto shall, at the option of
the Director of Finance, be either delivered to the Director of Finance or
deposited in an escrow or a trust account with a trustee for safekeeping for
the account of the Municipality. Any fees and expenses of the trustee shall be
paid by the eligible depository.
   When collateral securities have been deposited in such an escrow or trust
account, the eligible depository may substitute or exchange other collateral
securities having a current market value equal to or greater than the current
market value of the collateral securities then on deposit and for which they
are to be substituted for or exchanged if the Director of Finance gives a
written authorization either for that substitution or for the exchange or
substitution on a continuing basis during a specified period without prior
approval of each substitution or exchange. The Director of Finance shall send
written authorization to the eligible depository stating that substitution may
be made on a continuing basis during the specified period and under the
conditions specified therein. The eligible depository shall notify the Director
of Finance of any substitution or exchange of collateral securities. Upon
request of the Director of Finance, the eligible depository shall furnish a
detailed statement setting forth the face and market values of all collateral
securities pledged.
   The Director of Finance may require additional collateral securities to be
delivered or deposited to provide for any depreciation that may occur in the
market value of any of the collateral securities so delivered or deposited.
(Ord.1986-46. Passed 10-28-86.)
   125.05 FAILURE TO PAY DEPOSIT.
   If the depository bank fails to pay over any part of a deposit due the
Municipality, the Director of Finance shall have the option of selling in the
manner determined by the Director of Finance any of the collateral securities
deposited or segregated pursuant to the provision of this chapter. If the
collateral securities are in an escrow or a trust account with a trustee, the
Director of Finance may request the trustee to deliver to the Director of
Finance any of the collateral securities so deposited and the Director of
Finance shall have the option to sell such collateral securities in the manner
determined by the Director of Finance. When a sale of collateral securities has
been made, upon payment to the Director of Finance of the purchase money, the
Director of Finance shall transfer such collateral securities to the purchaser
whereupon the absolute ownership of such collateral securities shall pass to
the purchaser. Any surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the
Municipality and any expenses of the sale shall be paid to the depository bank.
This provision is in addition to any rights of the Municipality to recover
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
(Ord.1986-46. Passed 10-28-86.)
   125.06 POOLED COLLATERAL SECURITY.
   With the written approval of the Director of Finance, an eligible depository
in lieu of pledging collateral securities may provide collateral for public
moneys deposited pursuant to this chapter through a single pool of collateral
securities pledged for deposits of all public moneys held by the eligible
depository, subject to the following conditions:
   (a)    Collateral securities committed to the pool shall have a face value
at least equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of all public moneys on
deposit with the depository bank including the amount covered by Federal
Deposit Insurance.
   (b)    The collateral securities constituting the pool shall be segregated
in a separate escrow account as described in Section
125.04.
   (c)    If the eligible depository fails to pay over any part of the deposits
due the Municipality the Director of Finance may request the trustee to deliver
to the Director of Finance any of the collateral securities on deposit provided
the value of the collateral securities delivered shall not exceed the amount
necessary to produce an amount equal to Municipal deposits made and not paid
over, less the portions of such deposits covered by Federal Deposit Insurance,
plus any accrued interest due on the deposits; in any event, the value of such
collateral securities shall not exceed the Municipality's proportional interest
in the face value of the pool as of the date of the eligible depository's
failure to pay over the deposits. The Director of Finance shall have the option
to sell the collateral securities in such manner as determined by the Director
of Finance. Any surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the
Municipality and expenses of the sale shall be paid to the trustee.
   (d)    Within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter, the Trustee
shall provide a detailed statement setting forth the face value of all
collateral securities pledged to the pool and the total of all public moneys on
deposit with the eligible depository.
   (e)    If at any time the face value of the pool is less than one hundred
ten percent (110%) of all deposits of public moneys held by the eligible
depository, the eligible depository shall immediately add collateral securities
to the pool sufficient to bring the face value of the pool to at least one
hundred ten percent (110%) of all public moneys on deposit with the eligible
depository.
   (f)   Failure of the eligible depository to abide by any of the provisions
of this section shall be cause for its immediate suspension as an eligible
depository for any public moneys.
Collateral securities held in a pooled escrow account may be substituted and
exchanged in the same manner as described in Section
125.04.
      (Ord.1986-46. Passed 10-28-86.)
   125.07 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.
   The achievement of good fiscal management for the Municipality requires
effective cash management of public moneys, and in turn, effective bank
management practices with respect to the investment and deposit of these public
moneys. The following investment and deposit objectives shall be applied in the
management of public moneys:
   (a)   The primary objective of the Municipality's investment activities is
the preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.
   (b)    Those responsible for investing public moneys shall strive to
maximize the return on the investments but shall avoid assuming unreasonable
investment risks.
   (c)    The Municipality's investments shall remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the Municipality to meet operating requirements that might reasonably be
anticipated.
   (d)    The Municipality's investments shall be diversified to avoid the
assumption of unreasonable and avoidable risks associated with specific types
of securities or individual financial institutions. To the extent practicable,
of the public moneys, no more than fifty percent (50%) shall be invested in
repurchase agreements, nor more than fifty percent (50%) with any one eligible
depository.
   (e)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment
and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence,
discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of
their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   (f)   Price and rate quotations for all investments may be obtained from
eligible depositories designated pursuant to Section
125.02 within the Municipality or the County; provided, however, in the case of
the sale or purchase of investments where all other factors considered by the
Director of Finance are equal, placement shall be made with the designated
eligible depository situated within the Municipality. The right is reserved to
reject all bids or proposals or any bid if such is inconsistent with the
Municipality's investment objectives.

depositories designated pursuant to Section
125.02. To the extent possible, the Municipality's investments shall be made so
as to complement its anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a

of Finance is authorized to pool cash balances from the several funds of the

repurchase agreement with any designated eligible depository mentioned in Ohio
R.C. 135.03, if, and only if, under the terms of which agreement the Director
of Finance or his designee purchases for the Municipality and such institution

       (8)    Insured deposit accounts in eligible depositories paying interest
at a rate greater than the interest rate paid on the Municipality's active

hereof and the members of Council, the Mayor and the Director of Law shall not

of Finance or his designee.
   (f)   If any securities, obligations or certificates of deposit purchased
under the authority of this section are issuable to a designated payee or to
the order of a designated payee, the name of the Director of Finance and the

of Finance as such.

obligations and certificates of deposit.
   (i)   Whenever securities, obligations or certificates of deposit acquired
under this section mature and become due and payable, the Director of Finance
shall present them for payment according to their tenor, and shall collect the
moneys payable thereon. The moneys so collected shall be treated as public

earned on and after July 1, 1981, of all corporations, derived from sales made,
work done, services performed or rendered, and business or other activities
conducted in the Municipality, whether or not such corporations have an office
or place of business in the Municipality.
(Ord.1980-61. Approved by voters 3-3-81; Ord. 2005-44. Passed 7-11-05.)
   (f)   On the portion attributable to the Municipality pursuant to the terms
of this chapter and including:
      (1)    Royalty income. Income earned by a taxpayer from a royalty
interest in the production of an oil or gas well whether managed, extracted or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through an agent or other
representative, shall be included in the computation of net profits from a
business activity to the extent that such royalty interest constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer.
   Where the gross income received by a taxpayer from a royalty interest in the
production of an oil or gas well in a taxable year exceeds three thousand
dollars ($3,000) it shall be prima-facie evidence that the income was derived
from a business activity of such taxpayer and the net income from such royalty
interest shall be subject to tax.
      (2)   Employer's income. The employer's income derived from finance and
carrying charges associated with his customers' accounts receivable.
         (Ord 1986-33. Passed 7-14-86; Ord. 2005-44. Passed 7-11-05. )
   (g)   Occasional Entrant Rule.
      (1)   A non-resident individual who works in the Municipality twelve or
fewer days per year shall be considered an occasional entrant, and shall not be
subject to the Municipality’s income tax for those twelve days. For purposes of
the twelve-day calculation, any portion of a day worked in the Municipality
shall be counted as one day worked in the Municipality.
      (2)   Beginning with the thirteenth day, the employer of said individual
shall begin withholding the Municipality’s income tax from remuneration paid by
the employer to the individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the
Municipality in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. Since the
individual can no longer be considered to have been an occasional entrant, the
employer is further required to remit taxes on income earned in the
Municipality by the individual for the first twelve days. If the individual is
self-employed, it shall be the responsibility of the individual to remit the
appropriate income tax to the Municipality.
      (3)   The twelve-day occasional entry rule does not apply to entertainers
or professional athletes, their employees or individuals who perform services
on their behalf, or to promoters and booking agents of such entertainment
events and sporting events.

of businesses, professions or other activities earned on and after July 1,
1981.
(Ord.1980-61. Approved by voters 3-3-81.)
DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
   126.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to the municipal income tax, the
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the Municipality shall be determined as follows:
   (a)   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to
be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
subsection (a)(1) hereof, real property includes property rented or leased by
the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying
the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, the Administrator may approve the use of books and records as
a substitute method, by applying the following:
      (1)   The net profits allocable to the Municipality from business,
profession or other activities conducted in the Municipality by corporations or
unincorporated entities (whether resident or non-resident) may be determined
from the records of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is
attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the Municipality.
      (2)   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining the
manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the
Administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the
Municipality are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
      (3)   In determining the income allocable to the Municipality from the
books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution
made to the production of such income by headquarters activities of the
taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the Municipality.
         (Ord. 1968-730. Passed 6-18-68; Ord. 2005-44. Passed 7-11-05.)
   126.0702 SALES MADE IN THE MUNICIPALITY.
    As used in Section
126.0701(c) sales made in the Municipality means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Municipality.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Municipality
and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside of the Municipality regardless of
where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
      (Ord.1968-730. Passed 6-18-68.)
   126.0703 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
126.0701(a), (b) and (c) or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable
to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
126.0701.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Municipality.
(Ord.1968-730. Passed 6-18-68.)
   126.0704 RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under Section
126.0501(c), (d) and (e), only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates a
licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross
income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
(Ord.1971-850. Passed 12-7-71. )
   126.0705 OPERATING LOSS-CARRY FORWARD.
   (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to July 1, 1968, allocable to the Municipality may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the
Municipality, until exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.

final tax returns shall be due immediately after the fundamental change. Any
successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the successor
owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes, interest

trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about

interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under

time or work shift may be made at any time to meet the needs of the Village.
Generally, however, when such changes are made for a short period of time
(generally less than two days) with the expectation that the employee will
return to his original starting time of his work shift, his regular starting
time of his work shift should not be changed.
      (2)   Hours Worked for Overtime Calculation. For purposes of calculating
all employee overtime in this Section
149.06, paid holiday time, paid vacation time, and paid sick leave shall be

also apply to temporary full-time laborers when authorized and approved by the
department head.
   (f)   Compensation. All overtime which is not paid with regular compensation
under provisions of the salary ordinance shall not be accumulated and no
employee shall be entitled to compensation in any form for such overtime upon
termination of his employment with the Municipality. In no department is
overtime to be duplicated or pyramided. No credit will be allowed or premium
payment made for overtime labor unless it is rendered pursuant to prior order
or approval by the department head or other supervisory employee customarily
authorized to grant such approval.

in the Service Department may elect to receive compensatory time off instead of
paid overtime. Compensatory time may be accumulated to a maximum of eighty (80)
hours. Approval for the use of compensatory time shall be obtained by the
employee from the respective department head for use during a period which will
not unduly disrupt or interfere with the normal operation of that department.

R.C. Chapters 145 and 742 shall be paid, pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, by
the Village on behalf of the employee in lieu of contribution by the employees
and in accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (Ord. 2011-26. Passed 5-23-11.)
   (b)   This section shall apply to all Village officials and/or employees in
the following categories: Police Department personnel, Fire Department
Personnel, Public Service Department personnel, support personnel, elected

pick up and in lieu of OPERS or OP&F employee contribution otherwise payable by

required contribution directly instead of it being paid by the Village to OPERS
or OP&F.

salary less the amount of the pick up for that employee, and shall be payable,
subject to applicable payroll deductions to that employee.

OPERS or OP&F based upon an employee’s total salary. The total combined
expenditures of the Village for such employee’s total salaries payable under

items had this provision not been in effect.
      (2)   A person electing this pick up deduction shall not have the option
of choosing to receive the payroll deduction directly instead of having this
deduction picked up by the Village. Members who have elected to participate in
this plan cannot increase, decrease or terminate the amount of the pick up
deduction.
   (e)   All full-time Village employees identified in subsection (b) hereof
and who are contributing members of OPERS or OP&F may purchase additional
service credit, tax deferred, and the Village shall withhold the required
service credit deduction from the gross pay of each person who elects to do so
and shall pick up (assume and pay) such deduction to OPERS or OP&F in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.

necessary and appropriate to facilitate the implementation of the provisions of
this section, including, but not limited to, making applications to the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency

the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.

days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates any provision of subsections (a) to (d) of this section is guilty of a

procession upon any street or highway, or block off any street or highway area,
without first obtaining a permit from the Police Chief.
   Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms as may be
prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.
   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
      (6)   An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.
   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the place of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

skating, skiing or other similar sport, unless such road, street, highway or
alley has first been designated by the Chief of Police for such use, for such
days or parts of days as shall be designated by the Chief of Police. The Chief
of Police, in designating any road, street, highway or alley for such
recreational use, shall do so temporarily only, and shall cause sufficient
warnings and barriers to be erected so as to make the same reasonably safe for
recreational purposes without unduly inconveniencing the public in its use of
thoroughfares.
   (b)    No person shall slide or course upon hand-sleds or skates in any
street. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the setting aside of
streets or sections thereof for limited periods of time for such purposes while
under proper supervision.
   (c)    In times of emergency or when it is deemed necessary in the interest
of public safety, all police officers are authorized to close off streets or
portions of streets and divert traffic as the occasion may require, and
pedestrians and drivers of vehicles shall conform to the regulations so
established.

motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   The Mayor is authorized, where it is necessary to preserve health, to

zone of quiet, no person operating a motor vehicle within any such zone shall
sound the horn or other warning device of such vehicle except in an emergency.

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and County boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child or person’s residence side of the road.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof
shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, "emergency
medical technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic"
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, "emergency medical technician-intermediate" and
"emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who

affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

(Ord. 1954-326. Passed 12-13-54.)

      (Ord. 1968-735. Passed 9-17-68.)
   353.03  REGULATION OF PARKING IN METERED ZONES.
   (a)   Whenever a vehicle is parked in a metered parking zone where a parking
meter has been installed, the person parking such vehicle shall either (i)
register the vehicle in a Village of Chagrin Falls approved mobile parking
application system and pay for the parking permitted by such meter by payment
through a mobile parking application system approved and used by the Village of
Chagrin Falls, where the parking meter payment may be made by a mobile payment
application system when so designated, or (ii) deposit in such parking meter a
coin of United States money of the denomination designated on the plates
attached to such parking meter, if such meter displays the signal showing that
legal parking is only permitted on such deposit. If such parking meter requires
the movement of a lever or other device, as well as the deposit of a coin, to
cause the meter to operate, the person so depositing the coin shall immediately
so move the lever as to set the meter in operation. The coins required to
deposit in parking meters shall be set forth on the parking meter. Notice to
the public shall be given by appropriate signs setting forth the length of time
for which parking is permitted, the hours when payment for metered parking is
required within the Village and the conditions for parking either using a
mobile parking payment application system or paying by depositing coins in the
parking meter. The notice may be upon the parking meter stand or in the
immediate vicinity. Any vehicle which remains in a metered parking zone after
the prescribed time for parking has elapsed is hereby determined to be
illegally parked. At each place where metered parking zones are so established
as provided in Section
 353.01, and are so marked off, each vehicle shall be parked entirely within a
metered parking zone. (Ord. 2017-74. Passed 11-13-17.)
   (b)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles parked upon
the streets of the Municipality between the hours of 6:00 p. m. until 9:00 a.
m. the following morning, or upon Sundays or holidays. For the purposes of this
section Saturday afternoon shall not be considered a holiday. (Ord. 1968-735.
Passed 9-17-68.)
   353.04  UNLAWFUL PARKING IN METERED ZONES.
   (a)    No person shall park or cause, allow or permit to be parked any
vehicle owned or operated by such person in any parking space without
depositing the coin designated in Section
353.03 in the slot provided in such parking meter, and, if a hand-operated
parking meter is installed, without turning the lever on the parking meter as
far as it will go.
   (b)    No person shall cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered
in his name to be parked over-time or beyond the lawful period of time
prescribed by the provisions of this chapter as herein provided.
 
   (c)    No person shall cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle owned or
operated by such person to be parked on any line designating a metered parking
zone. Any vehicle parked contrary to these provisions shall be deemed to be
illegally parked. The fact that a vehicle is in a metered parking zone when the
time signal on the parking meter for the same shows no parking permitted,
unless a deposit of a coin is made as provided in this chapter, shall be deemed
prima-facie evidence of the unlawful parking of such vehicle by its owner.
(Ord. 1954-326. Passed 12-13-54.)
   (d)   It shall be unlawful for the driver, or the person in charge of a
vehicle, or any person during, or at the expiration of any maximum authorized

   In any hearing before the Mayor or other magistrate or the Bedford Municipal
Court, having jurisdiction over a charge of illegally parking a motor vehicle,
testimony that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate was found unlawfully
parked as prohibited by the provisions of this chapter, and further testimony
that the records of the Registrar or the Deputy Registrar of Motor Vehicles for
the State show that such license plate was issued to the defendant, shall be
prima-facie evidence that the vehicle which was unlawfully parked was so parked
by the defendant. A certified copy showing such fact from such Registrar or
Deputy Registrar of the State shall be proof of such ownership. (Ord. 2017-74.
Passed 11-13-17.)

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender's term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender's participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
 
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2,000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1,000.00
 
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

DISPOSITION.
   (a)   In addition to other procedures and penalties applicable to violations
of this chapter, the Chief of Police may take up and impound any animal found
in violation hereof, who has not been designated as dangerous or vicious yet.
If such animal is not wearing a valid license tag, the Chief of Police may,
within three (3) days after taking up such animal, turn such animal over to an
officer charged by law with the custody and disposal of such animals. If the
animal is wearing a license tag or some other type of identification showing
the name and address of its owner, the Chief of Police shall immediately give
such person notice that the animal has been found and taken up. The animal
shall not be released to its owner except upon payment to the Village of all
lawful costs assessed against the animal to cover the cost of taking it up,
plus such additional costs as may be incurred by the Village for impounding the
animal.
   Such release payment shall be tendered within five (5) days of receipt of
notice by the animal's owner; however, no period of holding by the Village
shall exceed seven (7) days unless the seventh (7th) days falls on a weekend.
Any animal not reclaimed within the respective time periods may be destroyed or
otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the Chief of Police. "Otherwise
disposed of" shall include the right to sell these animals to suitable
individuals for the cost to the Village of the animal's boarding. When such a
sale does occur, the Village shall not charge the buyer with the impounding
fee. No sale will be transacted until a valid registration tag, if required, is
obtained.
   (b)   The Village may assess against or charge the owner, keeper or harborer
of any domestic animal the actual costs relative to the seizure and/or
impoundment of such animal for its seizure, shelter, food, and any veterinary
care found necessary during impoundment. Such costs may include the cost to
have the animal spayed or neutered and vaccinated.
   (c)   The Chief of Police's Office may keep a register of people interested
in obtaining an animal impounded by the Village. Such register may be
categorized by the breed desired and should be set up to give the person who
has been registered the longest period of time the first chance to obtain the
animal.
(Ord. 2020-36. Passed 10-12-20.)
   505.21  COURT ORDER TO REMOVE OR DESTROY ANIMAL.
   In addition to any penalty provided herein, if the court determines that any
animal, on one or more occasions, has bitten or attacked any person or domestic
animal without provocation, or if the court determines that the owner of the
animal has habitually permitted such animal to run at large, or violated this
chapter on one or more occasions, the court may, in order to protect the
health, welfare, safety and property of the Village's inhabitants, order that
such animal be destroyed or permanently banished from the Village.

notice of appeal with the Bedford Municipal Court, and a copy shall be served
on the Village Police Department. Such appeal shall be filed within ten (10)
working days of the date of notice received from the Chief of Police in Section
505.22. The filing of a notice of appeal with the Bedford Municipal Court shall

of Health from impounding the dog if otherwise permitted by this chapter or
other provisions of law and shall not in any way relieve the owner or other

tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.
If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary or post-secondary

also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.

   731.03 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Minimum Tract. No permit shall be issued on a tract of less than
twenty acres. If a larger tract is required by the Rules and Regulations of the
Division of Oil and Gas, then such larger tract shall govern. A tract may be a
parcel in single ownership or a composite of land which is owned by several
persons or other separate entities. If the tract has more than one owner, then
a proper lease shall be executed between the applicant and all the owners of
the land. A copy of this unitized lease shall accompany the application for a
permit.
   (b)   Well Location. Drilling sites, storage tanks and other equipment shall
be located to conform with the following:
      (1)   200 feet from existing buildings on the tract, except as provided
in subsection (b)(2) hereof. For nonresidential buildings, except for schools
and other public places of assembly, this provision may be waived, in writing
by the owner and occupant of a building nearer than 200 feet from the proposed
well site or storage equipment provided that in no case shall such well or
equipment be nearer than 100 feet from such building. Such written
authorization shall be included with the application.
      (2)   300 feet from schools or other public places of assembly as defined
in the Ohio Basic Building Code.
      (3)   300 feet from adjacent properties.

forty feet along the access drive from the roadway. The hard surface shall be
eleven feet wide and constructed by placing three inches of asphalt on a six-
inch granular base; except that where the access drive enters a concrete
roadway, a concrete apron shall be placed from the roadway to the end of the
public right of way, whereupon the concrete apron shall meet the asphaltic hard
surface. The concrete apron shall be constructed of six-sack concrete and shall
be a thickness of six inches. From the end of the apron, access drives shall be
constructed of gravel, plank or appropriate material as determined by the
Village Engineer to assure that the surface is dust-free and adequate for the
vehicles intended.
      (3)   A gate shall be installed across the access drive at a point
adjacent to the roadway. Such gate shall be locked at all times when the access
road is not being used for well related purposes. Adjacent to the gate shall be
sufficient barriers by fencing, landscaping or mounding to reasonably prevent
unauthorized vehicle access to the well or storage sites. Sketch drawings and/
or written descriptions of the proposed gates and barriers, adequate to
indicate how the objective of preventing unauthorized access will be achieved,
shall be submitted with the permit application.
      (4)   Driveway culvert pipe shall be installed in accordance with Village
Codes.
      (5)   When a storage tank or well head is more than 300 feet from a
street right of way, the Fire Chief may require, in addition to the access
drive, an area developed and reserved for fire vehicles to turn around. When
required, such turnaround shall be a minimum of thirty feet long by twelve feet
wide provided further that the specific size, location and surface material
shall be determined and approved by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief shall review
the application and report recommendations to the Planning Commission according
to the procedures of Section
731.02(c)(5).
   (d)   General Requirements.
      (1)   No person engaged in drilling or operating any well shall permit
gas to escape or be vented into the air unless a plan for such venting, stating
the amounts of gas to be vented, the times and frequency, and precautions to be
taken, is first submitted, in writing, to and approved in writing by the Fire
Chief.
      (2)   Within thirty days after any oil and/or gas well has been completed
for the production of oil and/or gas, or abandoned, the permittee shall remove
any drilling rig or derrick, remove the excess sludge or mud, fill all pits and
excavations, level off the surface of the working area, not allow any
accumulation of sludge or oil or other offensive or dangerous substances to
accumulate, keep his premises in a sanitary and sightly condition, and restore
any disturbed drainage facilities and leave the premises in such a condition
that no pooling of surface water will result.

connection with drilling or any work over operations.
      (4)   Two dual-controlled, fluid operated blowout preventers with working
pressures equal to the maximum anticipated wellhead pressures shall be used for
all drilling or completion operations involving the use of drill pipe or tubing
after the surface casing has been set. The mechanical operation of the
preventers shall be checked every twenty-four hours and shall be tested with
pump pressure with enough frequency to insure good working order at all times.
      (5)   No oil, waste water, sludge water or salt water, produced or used
in connection with the drilling operation or production of oil or gas wells,
shall be disposed of within the Municipality and shall not be permitted to
empty into any sanitary sewer, storm sewer or surface drainage, unless, in an
emergency, such waste is to be used by the Village and authorized for such use
by the Chief Administrative Officer. However, temporary repositories for salt
water, waste or sludge water and basic sediment and water may be constructed of
concrete, steel or other material and in the latter case such pits for
temporary deposits shall be so constructed that no seepage shall result
therefrom and that surface water resulting from water drainage or rain, cannot
drain into such pit.
      (6)   Within six months of such completion or abandonment the area shall
be relandscaped to assure that all areas, other than access drives, are
restored with natural ground cover consistent with surrounding areas to avoid
any further erosion.
      (7)   All producing wells, wellheads, tank batteries, pumping units and
equipment appurtenant thereto shall be enclosed and protected by a six- foot
galvanized or aluminum chain link-type fence with matching-type gates and
effectively screened with evergreen plantings to the approval of the Chief
Administrative Officer.
      (8)   On residentially zoned land, each storage tank shall be a maximum
of 100 barrels (4,500 gallons) and a maximum of two storage tanks shall be
permitted for each well.
      (9)   The premises shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition free
from rubbish of every character, at all times, during the drilling operation
and as long thereafter as oil and/or gas is being produced therefrom. All
permittees’ premises shall be kept clear of high grass, weeds and combustible
trash or any other rubbish or debris that might constitute a fire hazard within
a radius of 100 feet around any oil tank or tanks, or producing wells.

rights to use the surface, or upon leases not owned by the permittee or into
the alleys, streets, gutters or sewers of the Municipality.
      (3)   Should any mud be carried on public streets from a drilling site,
the permittee shall be required to clean up the streets to the satisfaction of
the Village. Failure of a permittee to clean up the public streets to the
satisfaction of the Village, or failure to take specific steps to reduce mud at
a given location, as requested by the Village, shall be grounds for revocation
of a permit, forfeiture of the bond posted under Section
731.06(e), and shall further be a misdemeanor punishable under Section
731.99.
      (4)   All trucks hauling oil, sludge water, salt water, petroleum

   (e)   Bonding and Bond Forfeitures.
      (1)   An applicant, before being issued a permit hereunder, shall execute
and file with the Chief Administrative Officer a surety bond, conditional on
compliance with the foregoing regulations, in the amount of twenty thousand
dollars ($20,000) per well up to a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) per operator. The applicant may deposit with the Chief
Administrative Officer, in lieu of a surety bond, cash, or the equivalent of
cash, in the amount of the surety bond prescribed above. The surety bond
provided for in this section shall be executed by a surety company authorized
to do business in Ohio. The Chief Administrative Officer shall not approve any
bond until it is personally signed and acknowledged by both principal and
surety, or as to either by his attorney in fact, with a certified copy of the
power of attorney attached thereto. The Chief Administrative Officer shall not
approve such bond unless there is attached a certificate of the Superintendent
of Insurance that the company is authorized to transact a fidelity and surety

fact and declare any surety bond, or cash, filed to ensure compliance,
forfeited in an amount sufficient to correct any condition which adversely
affects the public health and safety, or is a condition prescribed in Section
731.04(b)(3); whereupon the Chief Administrative Officer shall certify the
forfeiture to the Director of Law who shall proceed to collect the amount
thereof. In lieu of forfeiture, the surety, at its option, may cause the
condition resulting in forfeiture to be corrected or pay to the Village Finance
Director the costs thereof. All funds collected under this section may be
expended by the Chief Administrative Officer to correct the condition
necessitating forfeiture. The owner may be released from the surety bond one
year after the Chief Administrative Officer has received written confirmation
from the State Division of Oil and Gas that the well has been satisfactorily
plugged in accordance with the regulations of the Division. Until the surety
bond is released by the Chief Administrative Officer in writing, such bond
shall remain in full force and effect for the benefit of the Village.

attention, may file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon
the filing of such a complaint, said Complaint Offficer shall notify the cable
operator and make an investigation to determine whether or not there is a
probable cause to credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines
after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations
of the complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion.

conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a

be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within 30 days thereafter, either the

decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the

exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Offficer

analyze and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be
delivered to the Complaint Officer no later than 14 days after said Officer
formally notifies the cable operator and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests;
what system component(s) was tested, the equipment used, and procedures
employed in resolving said complaints, if applicable; and any and all
additional information deemed relevant by the Complaint Officer.

engineer not on the permanent staff of the cable operator and selected by the
Village. The aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of special tests and
forward to the Complaint Officer such records with a report interpreting the
results of the test and recommending action to be taken by the Village.
      (6)    The cable operator shall notify each subscriber at the time of
initial installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer

   901.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, except a contractor performing Village work on a regularly
awarded Village contract, shall excavate within or bore or tunnel through,
along or across the limits of any street, alley or public grounds in or owned
by the Village, for the purpose of installing sewer, water or gas lines,
telephone or power conduits or cables, or any other structure, without first
having obtained a permit for such work from the Village.
(Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)
   901.02 PREREQUISITES FOR PERMIT.
   Prior to obtaining such permit, the person shall furnish the Village with
the following:
   (a)    A plan and general specifications showing the proposed location,
extent and nature of the work contemplated.
   (b)    Indemnity insurance saving the Village harmless from any damage to
persons or property arising from such work, and naming the Village as
additional insured in an amount approved by the Law Director.
   (c)    A bond guaranteeing that the work shall be done to the full
satisfaction of the Village represented by the Chief Administrative Officer or
his agent, or the Village Engineer, and that the area affected by the work
shall be restored to equal or better than its original condition and such
condition maintained, at the cost of the permit holder, for a period of one
year after the completion of the work, provided, however, that such bond may be
released at an earlier period if, in the opinion of the Chief Administrative
Officer, such release is warranted. The amount of such bond shall be
commensurate with the extent of the work and shall be determined by the Chief
Administrative Officer or his agent, but in no case shall the amount of such
bond be less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any one project.
   (d)    Parties who, because of their operations, find it necessary to enter
Village streets, alleys or public grounds for construction purposes for
recurring maintenance shall be permitted to furnish a blanket bond with the
same conditions as set forth above. The amount of such bond shall be determined
by the Chief Administrative Officer and the Village Engineer, but in no event
shall it be less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) provided that any project
of an extensive nature shall be covered by a specific bond, subject to the
discretion and approval of the Chief Administrative Officer as to amount and
conditions.
   (e)    The applicant shall cause a record, by video taping, of the area to
be excavated, to be provided prior to excavation depicting landscaping,
landscape features, sidewalks, curbing, driveways, aprons, fences, walls or
drainage ways. Such pre-excavation record shall be recorded on video taping, or
other photo recording with the approval of the Chief Administrative Officer,
and submitted to the Chief Administrative Officer.
      (1)    In the event the Chief Administrative Officer deems the project of
a minor nature, the prerecording above can be waived or in the alternative, a
substitute record of conditions prior to excavation may be submitted by the
applicant.
      (2)    In the event the applicant fails to make such record of the
conditions prior to construction, the Chief Administrative Officer is directed
to cause such record to be made and the cost for such record to be assessed to
the applicant in addition to any bonds or fees otherwise provided in these
Codified Ordinances.
         (Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)
   901.03 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The following rules and regulations shall govern the excavation of streets
in the Village:
   (a)    Special care shall be taken to reference all Village, Federal, State,
County or private property monuments encountered in the line of the work so
that such monuments, if disturbed, shall be correctly replaced upon completion
of construction.
   (b)    No work shall be performed by the permit holder or his agents nor
shall any excavation be backfilled, covered or filled except in the presence of
an authorized Village inspector. The cost of such inspection shall be borne by
the permit holder.
   (c)    Any Village-owned facility, such as sewers, water lines or any other
facilities or structures that are encountered during the work of construction,
shall be carefully protected, at the cost of the permit holder, to prevent
damages.
   (d)    Should it become necessary to remove and replace or relocate such
Village facilities, the work shall be done at the expense of the permit holder
in accordance with specific plans and specifications presented by the permit
holder and approved by the Village Engineer and the Chief Administrative
Officer or his agent.
   (e)    Privately owned facilities encountered in the work shall be
protected, removed, replaced or relocated by agreement between the owner of
such facilities and the permit holder, at no expense to the Village.
      (Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)
   (f)   When the material excavated from a trench is suitable for backfill, in
the opinion of the Chief Administrative Officer, the Village Engineer or the
Street Superintendent, it may be used for that purpose. Otherwise, the
excavated material shall be removed from the site of the work and replaced with
premium backfill or other material approved by the Village.
      (Ord. 2008-65. Passed 12-8-08.)
   (g)    Where a trench passes through a regularly maintained lawn, the
backfill material shall be thoroughly compacted in lifts not to exceed eight
inches to minimize settlement and the top portion brought to the grade of the
existing lawn, after not less than three inches of topsoil, free of stones or
other foreign material, has been applied, raked, rolled and seeded so that the
finished area will be equal to the original lawn removed. In lieu of the
foregoing, the original sod may be carefully removed and stockpiled and after
the trench backfill is compacted, the sod may be replaced with topsoil to be
placed under sod, then seed added if necessary, and rolled so that the lawn, as
disturbed, shall be equal to the original. At its option, the Village may
require sod instead of seeding with the permitter responsible for watering with
a frequency to insure healthy growth.
   (h)    Where the trench lies within driveway, parking or other areas subject
to traffic, the backfill material shall be premium backfill or other suitable
material, mechanically tamped, in not more than eight-inch layers, for the full
depth of the trench. The material removed from the surface of such areas shall
be replaced in kind and thoroughly compacted.
   (i)    When the trench passes longitudinally or transversely through an
asphaltic-type brick or concrete pavement, the backfill material shall be
premium backfill or other suitable material, mechanically tamped, for the full
depth of the trench, in layers not more than six inches thick.
   (j)    Under certain conditions as determined by the Village Engineer or
Superintendent of Streets, bar reinforcement over the trench may be required in
the base of brick pavements and in the upper third of concrete pavements.
   (k)    The surface course for any asphaltic-type, brick or concrete pavement
removed during the construction of the project shall be replaced in kind (as
per Exhibit
A,
B and
C) at the direction of the Chief Administrative Officer, Village Engineer or
Street Superintendent.
   (l)    Pipes, conduits or other facilities may be installed under roadways
by jacking, boring or tunneling. In the event any of these three methods is to
be used, the applicant for the crossing shall file with the Village a plan
showing how the work is to be done with particular reference to the manner in
which backfill is to be placed around the carrying pipe or conduit or around an
encasing pipe or structure. No work shall be done until such plan is approved
by the Village Engineer.
   (m)    Every excavation or trench within any portion of the public right of
way, whether a roadway, tree lawn or sidewalk area and irrespective of the type
of material with which such excavation or trench is backfilled, shall be filled
or backfilled by mechanical tamping of the backfill or fill material. Any
mechanical tamping equipment used shall be of a type approved by the Village
Engineer.
   (n)    All vehicles used by the contractor doing work in Village rights of
way or on Village property shall be clearly identified by signs showing the
company name on each side of the truck. The signs shall be of sufficient size
to permit easy reading by both pedestrian and passing motorist.
   (o)    Charges. The costs incurred by the Village for any street repair made
by the Village for work the permittee failed to perform or properly perform
shall be deducted from the bond on deposit with the Finance Director. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall notify the permittee that defective workmanship by
the permittee has caused the Village to make the specified repairs and the cost
thereof has been deducted from the bond posted by the permitter. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall notify the permittee of the additional amount that
must be deposited with the Village to maintain the bond in the full amount.
Complete compliance with the bond deposit requirement set forth herein is a
condition precedent to the issuance of either the initial or a subsequent
street opening or excavation permit.
   (p)    Village's Right to Restore Surface. If the permittee has failed to
restore the surface of the work area to its original and proper condition upon
the expiration of the time fixed by the Village or otherwise has failed to
complete the excavation work covered by such permit, the Chief Administrative
Officer or his agent, if he deems it advisable, shall have the right to have
all work done and things necessary to restore the work area and to complete the
excavation work. The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost thereof and
twenty-five percent (25%) of such cost in addition for general overhead and
administrative expenses. The Village shall have a cause of action for all fees,
expenses and amounts paid out and due it for such work and shall apply in
payment of the amount due it any funds of the permittee deposited as herein
provided and the Village shall also enforce its rights under the permittee's
surety bond provided pursuant to this chapter.
   (q)    Trees; Backfills. In the making of any such excavation or opening,
all work in connection therewith shall be done in such a manner as not to
injure or destroy the roots, trunk or branches of any tree and all directions
given by the Superintendent of Streets as to the manner of performing such
work, in order to avoid such injury or destruction, shall be fully and
completely complied with.
   (r)    All traffic control and traffic control devices shall be the
responsibility of the permit holder with written approval of the Police Chief.
   (s)    At the discretion of the Chief of Police, police officers shall be
provided at the expense of the permittee. Unless an emergency arises, the Chief
of Police shall be notified forty-eight hours in advance of need of traffic
control or traffic interruption.
   (t)    At the discretion of the Chief Administrative Officer, a
preconstruction meeting shall be held at least one week prior to start of any
work.
      (Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)
   (u)   Underground residential electrical service lines shall not be
permitted to be placed underground in any public utility easement, public
street or other public right of way, other than as approved in a platted
subdivision, and in no event shall any person be permitted to place residential
electrical service lines in any underground location which traverses Village
sewer or water lines.
      (Ord. 2006-69. Passed 11-27-06.)
   901.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the third degree. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 1985-8. Passed 2-25-85.)

   903.01 SIDEWALKS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Every improved lot in the Village shall, in conjunction with an
application for a building permit for a new main building, have a sidewalk
across the entire frontage of the lot and, on corner lots or through lots, each
improved lot shall provide sidewalks across both frontages. Sidewalks shall be
located and constructed in accordance with this chapter, any other applicable
Codified Ordinances, and any standards established by the Village Engineer.
Sidewalks shall be maintained in accordance with Section
903.03 and any other applicable Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   The Chief Administrative Officer is authorized to grant an exception
to the location and construction requirements, upon receipt of a written
application for exception by the property owner. The Chief Administrative
Officer, in deciding whether to grant an exception, shall consider the
recommendation of the Village Engineer, the unique physical characteristics of
the property, the presence of sidewalks in the surrounding area, the
availability of alternative means of pedestrian access, and any other factors
deemed relevant by the Chief Administrative Officer. Any person aggrieved by
the decision or action of the Chief Administrative Officer may appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals within 10 days of such official action. Such an appeal
shall be made in conformity with Chapter
1111. Written notice of the appeal shall be filed with the Chief Administrative
Officer.
   (c)   Any street or part of a street with existing single-family residences
not having sidewalks, as of the effective date of this section, shall not be
required to construct sidewalks until further order of Council.
   (d)   Before any certificate of occupancy is issued for any new building, a
sidewalk shall be constructed and installed in accordance with this section. If
the Chief Administrative Officer, upon recommendation of the Building
Inspector, determines that compliance is not possible due to weather
conditions, the Chief Administrative Officer is authorized to require the
applicant for the certificate of occupancy to submit a cash bond with the
Village for the cost of constructing the required sidewalk. Such bond shall be
deposited with the Finance Director, and the Building Inspector shall direct
the property owner to construct and install the required sidewalk at the
earliest time that weather conditions permit. If the property owner constructs
the sidewalk in conformance with all requirements, the Village shall return the
cash bond. In the event that the property owner fails to comply with the order
of the Building Inspector, after thirty days written notice, the Village may
use the cash bond to construct the sidewalk. If any balance remains after the
Village constructs the sidewalk, it shall be returned to the property owner. If
the amount of the bond is insufficient, the Building Inspector shall give
thirty days written notice to the property owner to pay the outstanding
balance. If the property owner fails to do so, the unpaid sum shall be referred
to collection.
(Ord. 2011-13. Passed 4-11-11.)
   903.02 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks and driveway aprons hereafter constructed, reconstructed,
replaced, altered or repaired in dedicated streets within the corporate limits
of the Municipality shall conform to the following requirements. For the
purpose of this chapter, all paved areas between the curb line and the property
line in dedicated streets shall be considered as sidewalk or driveway aprons.
   (a)    Alignment. The property edge of sidewalks shall be laid a minimum of
six inches off the property line abutting and fronting upon the street.
   (b)    Grades. The grade of sidewalks and driveways shall have a slope
towards the curb of one-fourth inch per foot from the property line to the
established grade of the top of the curb, except that driveway aprons may have
a steeper slope in the tree lawn or curb lawn area in order to meet the lowered
curb at the driveway apron. All paved or unpaved tree lawns or curb lawns shall
slope uniformly from the grade at the edge of the sidewalk nearest to the curb
to the grade at the top of the curb.
   (c)    Materials; Thickness; Specifications. All sidewalks, sidewalks
through driveways and driveway aprons shall be constructed of either Portland
Cement concrete or sandstone flagging in conformity with these specifications.
References to downtown areas shall include the following streets:
Washington Street - From Pleasant Drive to Walnut Street.
      Franklin Street - from the Main Street to Center Street.
N. Main Street - from May Court to Cottage Street.
Bell Street - from N. Main Street to the East Plaza Entrance.
      River Street.
      West Street.
      Orange Street - from Riverside Park to 500 feet west of West Street.
      (1)   Concrete for sidewalks shall be transit-mixed, State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation, Class “C” with a minimum cement content of 600
pounds per cubic yard and shall contain only non-silica bank run gravel and
sand as the aggregate. Gray (non-white) colored Portland Cement shall be used.
      (2)   Stone flagging shall be of the best quality of Berea or Amherst
sandstone or a sandstone of a like type and quality. The flagging shall be of a
uniform color and texture. No flagging will be acceptable that is subject to
sealing or cupping. The proportion of silica in the sandstone shall be at least
ninety percent (90%).
      (3)   Stone shall not be less than two and one-half inches in thickness
for walks and not less than four inches in thickness for driveways. Each
flagstone shall not be less than three feet in length and not less in width
than the full width of the walk for walks up to and including eight feet in
width, and not less than four feet in width for walks more than eight feet in
width.
      (4)   The face of the flagging shall be smooth and in every direction
true to a straight edge. Sides shall be straight and dressed so that joints in
the walk will be closed for the upper one and one-half inches, and not more
than one inch open at the bottom.
   (d)   Construction Methods (Portland Cement Concrete).
      (1)   Excavation. The earth shall be excavated to a depth of four inches
(six inches at driveways) plus the thickness of the base course. The entire
subgrade shall be shaped, tamped or rolled to secure a firm foundation. The
contractor shall provide and use a template, riding on the forms, for testing
the top of the compacted base before the concrete is placed. When sidewalk or
driveway apron is being replaced, the limits of the area to be removed shall be
defined by a straight full depth saw cut along an existing joint so as to
insure a vertical face for the new joint.
      (2)   Forms and contraction joints. The sidewalk shall be constructed
between metal forms whose height is equal to the thickness of the walk, except
at driveways and curves where wooden forms may be used, providing they are full
depth.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Chief Administrative Officer, forms shall be
set so that the back edge of the walk will be six inches on the street side of
the property line, at the designated grade. The walk shall have a uniform cross
slope of one-quarter inch per foot of width toward the street center line.
All utility castings and other similar fixtures, shall be adjusted to the grade
of the completed walk prior to the pouring of the concrete.
Where the sidewalk concrete surrounds posts, poles, fire hydrants, gratings,
castings and the like, the concrete immediately adjacent to such objects shall
be separated from the remaining concrete by means of joints extending through
the full depth of the sidewalk concrete. In general, these joints shall be
placed about six inches from poles, hydrants, etc. and arranged in the form of
squares or rectangles or as directed by the Chief Administrative Officer.
      (3)   Expansion joints. An expansion joint one-half inch in width, filled
with a pre-molded bituminous strip of suitable dimensions, shall be provided
for the entire width and thickness of the concrete, every fifty feet of length
and at the junction of street intersections, adjoining walks, and also along
buildings and walls where the walks cover the entire space between the curbing
and other fixed objects. Expansion joints shall also be provided around fixed
objects such as large gratings or castings, vault doors, utility poles,
foundations, area covers and the like.
      (4)   Placing and finishing concrete. Concrete sidewalks, sidewalks
through driveways, and driveway aprons shall be constructed in one course, four
inches thick for sidewalks, five inches thick in downtown areas, and six inches
thick for sidewalks through residential driveways and driveway aprons, and
eight inches thick through commercial aprons by placing concrete between the
forms described above.
The subgrade shall be adequately moistened just before the concrete is placed.
The concrete shall be placed at a slump of two to three inches unless otherwise
ordered by the Chief Administrative Officer. After placing, the concrete shall
be tamped, spaded and screeded. Internal vibrators will not be required for
concrete sidewalks. As soon as practical thereafter, the surface shall be
floated with a wooden float to a workmanlike finish, smooth and even but with a
slightly rough texture.
   Special care shall be exercised in finishing the surface on each side of the
expansion joints so as to avoid differences in elevation between adjacent
sections. The top edges of sidewalk sections shall be rounded with a suitable
one-quarter inch radius edging tool. The surface shall be divided into blocks
by forming joints with a grooving tool. The joints shall be spaced equally at
intervals to form rectangular blocks. The grooving tool shall leave a joint at
least one inch depth for the full width of the walk.
When the single sections of walk are constructed, they shall be separated from
the existing walk by means of at least one expansion joint, one-half inches in
thickness.
Where drain pipes cross underneath sidewalks, the walk shall be marked near the
edge with a small triangle, not less than one inch on a side, impressed into
the concrete.
Downtown areas shall be finished with an exposed aggregate (size 8 and smaller
bank run gravel) surface. Walks wider than five feet shall have offset
longitudinal contraction joints to form a running bond pattern. All offset “T”
joints shall receive a full depth sawcut to twelve inches, each side of the “T”
joint.
(5)   Sidewalk through driveways and driveway aprons. For sidewalk through
driveways and driveway aprons, the concrete shall be six inches in thickness
for residential drives and eight inches for commercial drives. The spacing of
joints shall be regulated so that the driveway starts and ends at a joint with
as many joints in between as may be suitable. In all other respects, driveways
shall be constructed as specified above for walks. An expansion joint shall be
placed against the curb and where the apron butts up against the sidewalk for
the full width and depth of the driveway or driveway apron.
      (6)   Curing. Immediately after the final finishing and after the free
water has disappeared, all exposed surfaces of the concrete shall be sealed by
spraying thereon, as a fine mist, a uniform application of clear membrane
curing material, meeting State of Ohio, Department of Transportation
Specifications. The curing material shall be applied in a manner as to provide
a continuous uniform water-impermeable film without marring the surface of the
concrete. The material shall be applied in one or more separate coats with an
approved mechanical spray at a minimum rate of one gallon of material for each
200 square feet of surface treated. Delay in application of the curing material
will not be permitted.
      (7)   Protection. The contractor shall be responsible for protecting the
walk against damage of all kinds until completed and accepted. Foot traffic on
the walk shall not be permitted for forty-eight hours after placing the
concrete. Auto traffic over the walk at driveways shall not be permitted for
forty-eight hours and then only on planks for seven days after placing
concrete.
All concrete placed when freezing temperatures are expected shall be insulated
to the satisfaction of the engineer for the duration of the curetime.
(8)   Backfilling. Forms shall be left in place for at least twenty-four hours.
Any exposed “honey-combed” shall be patched before backfilling. Edges shall be
carefully backfilled twenty-four hours after patching.
The contractor shall use every possible precaution to prevent injury to trees,
shrubbery and lawns which may be located on or near the site of the work, and
he shall not locate any equipment where the same would interfere with or injure
any trees, shrubbery or lawns. All shrubbery and lawns, either within the
limits of the excavation or contiguous to the work, shall be replaced or
restored to a condition at least as good as at the time of the commencement of
the work.
   (e)   Construction Methods (Sandstone Flagging).
      (1)   Excavation. All the provisions of section 3.01 (Portland Cement
Concrete) of these specifications covering excavation for Portland Cement
concrete sidewalks and driveway aprons shall apply to grading for sandstone
sidewalks and driveways, except that the depth of excavation shall be modified
to accommodate the appropriate thickness of sandstone flagging.
      (2)   Old stone flagging taken up and relaid. Flagging suitable for
relaying shall be taken up, rejointed and relaid in proper line and grade. All
flagging not suitable for relaying shall be replaced with new flagging meeting
the requirements herein specified.
      (3)   Laying flagging. The flagging for walks shall be laid with close
joints and brought to an even surface conforming to the proper alignment and
cross slope which is the same as that provided for Portland Cement concrete
sidewalks in section 3.02 (Portland Cement Concrete) of these specifications.
The surface shall be free from depressions and inequalities. Exposed sides
shall be pitched off to a continuous straight line conforming to the width of
the walk. All utility castings and other similar fixtures, shall be adjusted to
grade by cutting neatly fitted openings in the flagging to accommodate the
casting.
      (4)   Backfilling and restoration. Edges shall be carefully backfilled
upon completion of the laying of the sandstone flagging. The contractor shall
use every possible precaution to prevent injury to trees, shrubbery and lawns
which may be located on or near the site of the work, and he shall not locate
any equipment where the same would interfere with or injure any trees,
shrubbery or lawns. All shrubbery and lawns, either within the limits of the
excavation or contiguous to the work, shall be replaced or restored to a
condition at least as good as at the time of the commencement of the work.
         (Ord. 1974-948. Passed 11-19-74; Ord. 2005-49. Passed 8-8-05.)
   903.03 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    No owner or occupant of any property abutting a street shall fail to
keep the sidewalk adjacent to such property in good repair.
   (b)    Whenever the condition of any sidewalk or driveway apron in a
dedicated street in the Village does not essentially conform to the
requirements of Section
903.02, or:
      (l)    There is settlement of abutting sidewalk blocks which produces a
surface difference of elevation in excess of three-fourths inch, or
      (2)    There are cracks in a sidewalk block which have separated
horizontally in excess of one-fourth inch and/or vertically in excess of three-
fourths inch, or
      (3)    There are individual blocks of sidewalks that have fragmented,
pitted or disintegrated fifty percent (50%) or more, or
      (4)    There are individual sidewalk blocks which have settled or heaved
to the extent that the change of elevation is in excess of three-fourths inch,
or
      (5)    There are individual sidewalk blocks that have an improper slope
to the street of three-fourths inch per foot or greater, or
      (6)    There are individual sidewalk blocks that have a severe pitch
toward the dwelling when the yard is graded toward the street of one-half inch
transverse elevation difference across blocks or greater, or
      (7)    There exist any obstructions or nuisances therein;
the Village may proceed to correct such condition and may charge and assess the
cost thereof against the owners of the abutting property. If such cost is to be
charged and assessed against the owners of the abutting property, the
proceedings shall conform to the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code governing

characteristics enumerated in Section
911.06, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
   (a)    Reject the wastes;
   (b)    Require pretreatment to acceptable condition for discharge to public
sewers;
   (c)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of

   (b)   Control Manholes. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of
any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
   (c)   Measurements, Tests, Analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of
the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this
chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater" published by the American
Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a
twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of
all outfalls whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples.
   (d)    Special Agreements. No statement contained in Sections
911.04 to
911.08 and this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement
or arrangement between the Municipality and any industrial concern whereby an

to precede all section numbers of this Code.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1105.02 FINDINGS OF FACT. 
   (a)   This Planning and Zoning Code is adopted to promote and protect the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and/or general welfare
by Regulating the use of buildings, other structures and land for
institutional, residential, business, industrial or other uses;
   (b)   Regulating the area and dimensions of lots, yards and other open
spaces;
   (c)   Regulating and restricting the location, bulk, height, design and land
coverage of buildings and structures; by regulating and limiting the density of
population;
   (d)   Establishing districts of such classification, number and dimensions
as may be considered best to implement comprehensive planning; and
   (e)   Providing regulations and procedures for the administration,
interpretation, amendment and enforcement thereof.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1105.03  OBJECTIVES.

applied to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)   To protect the character and values of the parks, institutional,
residential, business, industrial and public uses and to assure their orderly
and beneficial development;
   (b)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air; to prevent
overcrowding of the land; to prevent excessive concentration of population, and
conversely to prevent sparse and uncoordinated development;
   (c)   To improve the public safety and to lessen congestion by locating
buildings and uses in relation to streets so as to cause the least interference
with, and be damaged least by traffic movements;
   (d)   To minimize conflicts between different land uses by requiring
adequate landscaping, yards, and buffers in appropriate locations;
   (e)   To provide for public facilities and utilities such as a water supply,
a sewer system and transportation systems as well as land for recreation,

   (b)   The provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code shall be considered as
minimum requirements and shall be literally construed to further its underlying
purposes and objectives. They shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
building, structure or land. Where the provisions of this Planning and Zoning
Code impose greater restrictions upon buildings, structures, uses or land than
imposed or required by other codes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or
restrictive covenants running with the land, this Planning and Zoning Code
shall govern; and conversely, other regulations shall govern where they are
more restrictive than this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)   The classification of districts set forth in Chapter
1119 shall not be construed as an enumeration of most restrictive to least
restrictive districts. Neither shall it be construed that a use permitted in a
certain district shall be permitted in a district which is enumerated
subsequently, unless such use is specifically listed as permitted in such
subsequent district.
   (d)   This Planning and Zoning Code shall not be construed as removing or
rendering inoperative any deed or land restriction established by restrictive
covenants running with the land, easements or other agreements between parties.

   1105.06 RELATION TO OTHER REGULATIONS.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Planning and Zoning
Code, they shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion
of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general
welfare.
   (a)   Except as specifically herein provided, the provisions of this
Planning and Zoning Code shall not annul existing deed or plat restrictions,
codes, laws, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued.
   (b)   Where this Planning and Zoning Code is more restrictive as to the use
of structures, buildings or land, and/or limits the height or bulk of
buildings, or requires larger areas and yards than are required by other deed
or plat restrictions, codes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, this
Planning and Zoning Code shall govern; and conversely, other regulations shall
govern where they are more restrictive in nature than this Planning and Zoning
Code.
   (c)   This Planning and Zoning Code shall not be construed as removing or
rendering inoperative any deed or land restriction formerly established by
restrictive covenants running with the land, easements or other agreements
between parties.
   (d)   Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Planning and Zoning
Code, if the requirements of an Overlay District conflict with the requirements
of the underlying district or any other provision of Municipality regulations,
the requirements of the Overlay District shall govern.

section 2923.11 of the Ohio Revised Code.

   1105.07  SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision, or the application of any provision, of this Planning and
Zoning Code or amendments thereto is declared to be invalid by a judicial
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the effect of such determination
shall be limited to that provision or provisions expressly stated to be
invalid, and such determination shall not affect, impair or nullify this
Planning and Zoning Code as amended as a whole or any other part thereof.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1105.08 CONDITIONS IMPOSED UPON ISSUING APPROVALS AND PERMITS.
   Whenever the Council, any board, commission, Village Engineer, Chief
Administrative Officer, Administrator, or Building Inspector (collectively
"Approving Authority") has been delegated the power to approve plans, issue
permits, for improvements, development, construction, reconstruction, or
renovation of land, buildings and structures as provided for in the Planning
and Zoning Code, such Approving Authority may impose conditions, so long as
such conditions are in compliance with any applicable statutes, ordinances and
standards, on any such approval with such conditions the Approving Authority
believes are necessary to impose in order that the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort and general welfare of the residents and the Village may
be safeguarded and substantial justice done.

applicant, shall submit a final plan of the design. The Architectural Board of
Review shall approve the final plan if it determines that the design is in
accordance with the approved preliminary plan, and any variances granted by the
Board.
            3.   Concurrent review. The Architectural Board of Review may
accept a concurrent submission of a Preliminary Plan and a Final Plan, provided
that such submission satisfies the submittal requirements of this chapter, and
no variances from the Board of Zoning Appeals or modifications from the
Planning and Zoning Commission will be requested for the project.
         E.   Approval/Disapproval. The Architectural Board of Review shall
either approve, approve with modification or disapprove the final plan in
accordance with the review and approval procedures set forth in Section 1109.05
and the standards of Chapters

discretion, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall notify by first class mail
owners of property abutting, and directly across the street from, the location
of the property involved in the application request. The notification shall set
forth the time and place of the meeting and a summary of the proposed

property within three hundred (300) feet of the location of the property
involved in the application request. The addresses of such owners shall be
obtained from the addresses appearing on the County Auditor's tax list or the

Hearings shall be public. Upon the day of a hearing the reviewing body may

hearing, persons previously notified and persons already heard need not be
notified of the time of resumption of such hearing unless the reviewing body so
decides.

   1111.01  INTENT.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear any questions or disputes involving
the interpretation of provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code, which shall
be final, unless the matter is referred to the Council as set forth in this
Chapter
1111. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether or not a variance
from the strict letter of the Planning and Zoning Code should be granted. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether decisions of administrative
officers, boards or commissions should be affirmed, reversed or modified on
appeal.
   (a)    When reviewing a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission where
it has acted to modify any part of the Planning and Zoning Code, as applied to
any proposed development, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be guided by the
review standards set out in Sections
 1111.07,
1111.08 and
1111.09 of this Chapter
1111, to the extent applicable.
   (b)   If the standards set out in subsection

the review standards set out in the following subsections:
      (1)   When reviewing other decisions of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, or decisions of the Architectural Board of Review, or any
administrative officer, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall first determine if
(a) the decision was based on a correct interpretation of the Ordinances and
Regulations of the Municipality; and (b) the decision was not unreasonable or
an abuse of discretion, where discretion is permitted by the Ordinance or

administrative officer, board or commission that rendered such decision.
Otherwise the Board of Zoning Appeals shall affirm such decision.
         (Ord. 2022-10. Passed 4-11-22.)
   1111.02  JURISDICTION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt such rules and regulations, provided
they are not in conflict with this Planning and Zoning Code or other ordinances

jurisdiction conferred upon it as follows:
   (a)   To hear appeals of final decisions made by the Administrator, or by
any administrative officer, board or commission of the Municipality , on

provisions contained in the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality , for
relief from any order, requirement, decision or determination, including the

   (b)   To hear and determine applications for variances from the terms
provided in the Planning and Zoning Code subject to the standards provided in
the Planning and Zoning Code;

matter is referred to the Board of Zoning Appeals in the Planning and Zoning
Code or other provisions of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.03  APPLICATION FOR APPEALS OR VARIANCES.
   An appeal shall be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals only after
formal action has been taken by the Administrator or other officers, or is
taken at a public meeting by a board or commission with regard to an
application for a building permit, zoning certificate, issuance of a stop
order, specific referral or some similar action; provided that:
     (a)   Within ten (10) days of such action, an application for appeal shall
be filed with the Administrator; and when applicable, an application for a
variance shall be filed with the Administrator; and
     (b)    Application for appeal or variance shall include reference to the
decision or sections of this Planning and Zoning Code from which the appeal or
variance is sought and all necessary data in accordance with the form provided.
    (c)    An application for an appeal may be filed by (i) the person who has
been denied a building permit, zoning certificate or any other authorization,
(ii) a person who has received a stop work order under any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, (iii) any property owner who can prove they would be
especially damaged by the issuance of a permit or other administrative
approval, or (iv) any property owner who should have received a notice of a
request for approval of a project pursuant to Section
1109.05 of this Planning and Zoning Code and who has an interest, established
by law, in the disposition of such matter.
     (d)    Prior to filing an application for a variance from the Board of
Zoning Appeals, for the erection, enlargement and/or alteration of a building
in the Municipality, the applicant shall be required to first obtain
preliminary plan approval from the Architectural Board of Review for such
building.
   (e)    In the event an aggrieved party was provided with incorrect written
information from the Administrator, Building Inspector, Secretary of the
Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals, or other Village
official with authority to provide information on appeal deadlines, as to the
date when an appeal from formal action taken pursuant to this Section must be
filed, and as a result the aggrieved party is unable to timely file an appeal
from such action, the aggrieved party shall have a period of ten (10) days from
the date that they discovered the correct deadline to file an appeal, but not
to exceed twenty (20) days after formal action has been taken from which an
appeal must ordinarily be filed with the Administrator, by filing the
appropriate application and information as required by the Planning and Zoning
Code.
    In the event an appeal is filed pursuant to this section, the Building
Inspector shall issue an order to the permit recipient to discontinue all work
authorized under such permit, in accordance with Section
1307.10, during the pendency of the appeal. Further work performed under such
permit, during the pendency of the appeal, shall be deemed to be in violation
of this provision. (Ord. 2022-10. Passed 4-11-22.)
   1111.04  NOTICES.

public hearing shall be in accordance with Section
1109.09 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.05 MEETINGS, QUORUM AND VOTE.
   (a)   Hearing of Appeals and Variances. The Board shall allow any interested
party to submit admissible evidence or testimony to the Board, provided that
all testimony shall be submitted under oath, and all interested parties shall
be permitted to cross-examine witnesses and present their positions, arguments
and contentions. In the event the Board determines that evidence or testimony
is not admissible, the Board shall permit the proffer of such evidence in a
manner which allows for the creation of a complete record.
   (b)   Quorum and Vote. A majority of the members of the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In each case
a motion or motions shall be made to grant the relief requested. Such motions
may be made and seconded by members who are opposed to the motion. The
affirmative vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary for any
official decision. Failure to receive three (3) affirmative votes will
constitute a denial of the motion pending before the Board and will result in
an affirmance of the prior administrative action being reviewed, or the
requested variance(s) will be considered denied. Prior to voting on a motion,
Board members shall state facts which support their decision. Such facts shall
become the basis for Conclusions of Fact by the Board. Members may state their
agreement with a prior articulation of facts and need not restate all facts
supporting their decision prior to voting on the motion.
   (c)   Decisions and Conclusions of Fact. After the public hearing, the Board
shall make its determination which shall include a decision and conclusions of
fact. The Board shall also prepare its record in accordance with Section
1111.06 of this Chapter, when the matter will be referred to Council for review
of the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.06 RECORD OF DECISION.
   (a)   As soon as possible after the Board of Zoning Appeals makes any final
reviewable decision, the Chief Administrative Officer shall notify, in writing,
the Clerk of Council of such action and notify each member of Council, using
the electronic mail address they have provided to the Clerk of Council for
receiving notices of Council business, or if none, by personal delivery, of the
action taken by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written notification by
the Chief Administrative Officer regarding a final decision made by the Board
of Zoning Appeals, any three (3) or more members of Council may, in writing and
emailed to the Clerk of Council, with copies provided to each member of Council
at their electronic mail address, or if none by personal delivery, in any form
or manner such Council members deem appropriate, request that the Clerk of
Council set a public hearing to review the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, in which case the Council shall receive testimony, and consider the
evidence presented to Council, which shall also include the record to be
prepared and provided by the Board of Zoning Appeals to Council, including its
decision and conclusions of fact, and the decision of Council shall be final in
regard to any exception, variance, interpretation or review of orders of
administrative officials, boards or agencies of the Municipality, and a
majority of Council shall be required to either affirm or reverse the decision
of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Notice of the hearing by Council shall be given as provided in Section
 1109.09 of the Planning and Zoning Code, including to the applicant before the
Board of Zoning Appeals that is the subject of the review by Council.
   (d)   If three (3) or more members of Council fail to request a hearing
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notification of the decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals by the Clerk of Council, the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be final.
   (e)   The notice to be provided by at least three (3) members of Council to
have such Board of Zoning Appeals' decision reviewed by Council shall provide
the name of the applicant, the address of the property that is the subject of
the exception, variance, interpretation or review of orders of administrative
officials, and which action(s) of the Board of Zoning Appeals will be reviewed
by Council, but the failure to include all such information shall not impair
Council's review of the decision.
   (f)   The Clerk of Council shall give notice of the hearing of the request
for review by the three (3) or more Council members to the applicant, the law
director, and the secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Ord. 2022-10.
Passed 4-11-22.)
   
   1111.07 REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals, and in the case of a review of the
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision by Council, may, in specific
cases, vary, modify or waive the application of certain provisions of this
Planning and Zoning Code, after making findings of fact setting forth the
reasons therefor, with such conditions the Board of Zoning Appeals or Council
believes are necessary to impose in granting a variance in order that the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done.
(Ord. 2022-10. Passed 4-11-22.)
   (b)   Variances shall not be granted for uses not permitted in the zoning
district applicable to the property, unless a literal application of this
Planning and Zoning Code would result in an unnecessary hardship that:
      (1)   Was not self-created;
      (2)   Is due to unique conditions existing on the property;
      (3)   The property cannot be used for the purposes for which it is zoned;
      (4)   Will not violate the spirit of the Planning and Zoning Code;
      (5)   Is the minimum necessary to avoid the unnecessary hardship; and,
      (6)   Results from special conditions unique to the property being
reviewed.
   (c)   Area variances may be granted on the basis of a finding of a practical
difficulty. While no single factor controls in the determination of a practical
difficulty, the factors to be considered and weighed include, but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and,
      (8)   Whether the variance is based on circumstances that are self-
created or exist as a result of actions of the property owner.
         (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.08 VARIANCES FOR YARDS; SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS. 
   The Board of Zoning Appeals, or in the case of a review of its decision by
Council, the Council, may permit variations of yard regulations in a
residential district for a lot of record, provided the Board of Zoning Appeals,
or Council, as the case may be, finds that privacy will not be impaired, and
that light and ventilation will be adequate on such lot and not unduly
diminished on adjoining lots.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.09  LANDSCAPE AND PROTECTIVE FEATURES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals, or in the case of a review of its decision by
Council, the Council, upon making various determinations, shall endeavor to
protect adjoining property, to assure safety of pedestrians and convenience of
traffic movements within the area in question, and may require the provision of
curbs, guard rails, walls, fences or other landscape or protective features, to
further the purposes of this Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1111.10  ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   When required to review a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals,
pursuant to Section
1111.06 of the Zoning Code, each case shall be considered by Council upon the
record created by the Board of Zoning Appeals, and as supplemented by the
evidence presented by the applicant, the Municipality or anyone else interested
in the proceeding.
   (b)   Council shall apply the laws of the Municipality to the facts of the
case as those facts are contained in the record which was created by the Board
of Zoning Appeals or supplemented in the proceedings before Council, where
testimony shall be taken under oath and subject to issuance of subpoenas upon
request, and such testimony shall be subject to cross examination whether it be
presented at the Board of Zoning Appeals or Council.
   (c)   In the event the Council does not follow the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals, Council shall make its own decision and shall adopt Conclusions
of Fact which support its decision, and which are found in the record.
   (d)    Quorum and Vote. A majority of the members of Council shall
constitute a quorum for the review of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision. In
each case a motion or motions shall be made to grant the relief requested. Such
motions may be made and seconded by members who are opposed to the motion. The
affirmative vote of four members of Council shall be necessary for any official
decision. Failure to receive four (4) affirmative votes will constitute a
denial of the review pending before Council and will result in an affirmance of
the prior administrative action being reviewed. Prior to voting on a motion,
the movant and/or other Council members shall state findings which support
their decision. Such findings shall become the basis for Conclusions of Fact by
the Council. Members may state their agreement with the proffered findings and
need not restate all findings supporting their decision prior to voting on the
motion.
   (e)   At any time prior to a final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals,
or Council, the applicant may withdraw the application. Receipt of notice of
the withdrawal of an appeal or an application for a variance or exception, at
any time prior to final action by the Board of Zoning Appeals, or Council, as
the case may be, shall reinstate the prior decision of any administrative
officer or body and the appeal or application for a variance or exception shall
be treated as though it had not been submitted, except that the applicant will
not be entitled to the return of any fees, deposits or costs required in this
Planning and Zoning Code.
   (f)   After reviewing the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision, Council may
affirm, affirm and modify or reverse the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals by a majority vote of all of its members.
   (g)   Immediately following Council's decision, notice of such decision
shall be mailed to the applicant and all interested parties who personally
appeared before Council to support affirmance or reversal of the decision of
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (h)   The applicant or any interested party who appeared or was represented
at the Council meeting(s) where the matter was heard, and was harmed by the
action of Council may appeal Council's decision pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter
2506.
(Ord. 2022-10. Passed 4-11-22.)
   1111.11 TIME PERIOD TO FILE APPEAL.
   The applicant or any such interested party who is held by action of Council
may appeal Council's decision pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506. The time
period to appeal any final decision rendered by either (i) the Board of Zoning
Appeals, in the event three (3) members of Council have not requested that
Council review a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, within fifteen (15)
days after such decision, or (ii) by the Council, in the event Council is
required to review a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to
Section
1111.06 of this Planning and Zoning Code, shall commence to run upon the date
that the Administrator or his designee sends notice, by electronic mail, or by
depositing a letter with the United States Postal Service, with postage pre-
paid, notifying the aggrieved party who first filed an appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals of the final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or the
Council, as the case may be. The notice shall be sent to the e-mail address or
residence or business address designated by the applicant when filing an
application for relief from the Board of Zoning Appeals. Failure of the
applicant to receive such notice shall not be a basis for tolling or extending
the time period to file an appeal pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

listed in any of the permitted building or use classifications in any of the
districts, or on its own initiative, additions or clarifications thereto may be
made by the Planning and Zoning Commission, in compliance with the following
standards:
      (1)   Such use is not listed in any other classification of permitted
buildings or uses and is not specifically prohibited in this Planning and
Zoning Code;
      (2)   Such use is more appropriate to, and conforms more closely to the
basic characteristics of the classification to which it is to be added than to
any other classification;
      (3)   Such use does not create dangers to health and safety, and does not
create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare or other
objectionable influences to an extent greater than the other uses listed in the
classification to which it is to be added; and
      (4)   Such use does not generate traffic to a greater extent than the
other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
   (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend such additions or
clarifications to Council. If Council, by a majority vote of its members,
concurs with the recommendation of the Commission, such use shall be deemed to
be similar and permitted in the requested use district. No public hearing shall
be required to include the similar use in a use district.

existing buildings; and
   (c)   To consider the historical and architectural nature of existing
buildings, signs and structures within the Municipality and the compatibility

chapter. The painting of buildings and structures shall not be governed by
these regulations nor buildings considered Historic that are regulated under
Chapter
1146.
   (b)   Limitation.  In administering these provisions, it is not intended to
insist that new construction or alterations copy either existing architectural
styles or existing decorative detail. Further, the Architectural Board of
Review shall not be overly restrictive in its judgment of structures not highly
visible from a public street or public property, except where such construction
or alteration would materially and adversely affect another property.

the proposed building or structure meets the standards set forth in Section
1115.04.
   (c)   Conformance. Construction shall be in conformance with an approved
Final Plan. No material changes shall be made to an approved Final Plan prior

caused a material change to an approved Final Plan, the applicant plan shall be
referred back to the Architectural Board of Review for consideration of such
change, All work related to the Final Plan shall cease and the Administrator
shall suspend any permit issued in reliance upon such approval until the change
in the Final Plan is finally resolved.

   1127.07  DESIGN REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.
      In an ASF District, attached single-family dwellings and other structures
shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following design
regulations and standards.
   (a)   Building Design. In order to enhance privacy and to reduce the
apparent mass of the buildings, the alignment of attached single-family
dwellings should be varied and the facades of not more than every two dwelling
units shall be offset by at least sixteen inches. Variations in exterior
features such as facade, width, color, exterior materials and roof lines shall
be deemed desirable. Furthermore, parallel arrangements of buildings should be
avoided.
   (b)   Site Design. Attached single-family developments shall be designed to
complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural contours,
economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading, and
maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural features.
Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangements of
dwellings, open spaces and accessory uses.
   (c)   Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography, relative to other
properties in the same Zoning District, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses
if compliance with these requirements is either clearly infeasible or contrary
to compliance with the design regulations and standards of this section.
However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased by reason of this
provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications under this section prior
to filing an application as set forth in Section
1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses.
   (d)   Common Open Space. As required in Section
1127.03(i), at least 750 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be
reserved as common open space in each ASF District.
      (1)   Required characteristics. Land designated as common open space
under the provisions of this section shall conform to the characteristics
described below.
         A.   Common open space shall consist of land or a combination of land
and water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for passive
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads, parking areas or private open space.
         B.   Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
         C.   Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units.
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
         D.   Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
      (2)   Ownership and maintenance.
         A.   The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which
provide for the permanent preservation of open space at the time of application
for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
         B.   Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
         C.   In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and shall own the open space in
unencumbered fee simple title.
         D.   All common open space shown on the site plan must be owned by an
association or corporation solely owned and controlled by the dwelling unit
owners, and subject to legally enforceable declarations and restrictions. Such
declarations and restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the
Municipality as a third-party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must
obtain approval of the Law Director before final approval for development will
be granted. .
   (e)   Pedestrian Circulation. Each attached single-family residential
development shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system adequately
separated from vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings to
parking and recreation areas.
   (f)   Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving an attached single-family
residential development shall be located underground.
              (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1127.08 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   In addition to the applicable regulations of Chapter
1141, the following parking regulations shall apply in an ASF District.
   (a)   Common Parking Areas.  In addition to the parking required in Chapter
1141, a minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street parking space per attached single
family dwelling unit shall be provided in unenclosed common parking areas
distributed throughout the development in a manner providing convenient access
to all dwelling units.
   (b)   Garages.  Each garage shall be provided for the exclusive use of a
single dwelling unit and shall be attached to the residential structure which
contains that unit. Such garages may be attached to one another at side walls
in order to improve design.

   1129.07 DESIGN REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.
      In RMF-10 and RMF-15 Districts, land and structures shall be developed
and maintained in accordance with the following design regulations and
standards.
   (a)   Building Design. The maximum length of any multi-family residential
building shall be 100 feet. Buildings may be attached if it is determined by
the Planning and Zoning Commission that site design will be improved as a
result. However, attached buildings shall be designed with visible offsets or
setbacks not less than six feet in depth or with substantial variations in
alignment. To reduce the apparent mass of buildings, variations in facade,
width, color, exterior materials and roof lines shall be deemed desirable;
furthermore, parallel arrangements of buildings should be avoided.
   (b)   Site Design. Multi-family residential developments shall be designed
to complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural contours,
economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading and
maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural features.
Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the arrangements of
dwellings, open spaces and accessory uses.
   (c)   Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography, relative to other
properties in the same Zoning District, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses
if compliance with these requirements is either clearly infeasible or contrary
to compliance with the design regulations and standards of this section.
However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased by reason of this
provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications under this section prior
to filing an application as set forth in Section
1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses.
   (d)   Common Open Space. As required in Section
1129.03(f), at least 750 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be
reserved as common open space in RMF-10 and RMF-15 Districts.
      (1)   Required characteristics. Land designated as common open space
under the provisions of this section shall conform with the characteristics
described below.
         A.   Common open space shall consist of land or a combination of land
and water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for active
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads or parking areas.
         B.   Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
         C.   Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units.
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
         D.   Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
      (2)   Ownership and maintenance.
         A.   The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which
provide for the permanent preservation of open space at the time of application
for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
         B.   Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
         C.   In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and shall own such open space in
unencumbered fee simple title.
         D.   All common open space shown on the site plan must be owned in
unencumbered fee simple title by an association or corporation solely owned and
controlled by the dwelling unit owners, and subject to legally enforceable
declarations and restrictions. Such declarations and restrictions shall grant
enforcement rights to the Municipality as a third-party beneficiary and shall
be reviewed by and must obtain approval of the Law Director before final
approval for development will be granted.
   (e)   Pedestrian Circulation. Each multi-family residential development
shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system, adequately separated from
vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings to parking and
recreation areas.
   (f)   Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving a multi-family
residential development shall be located underground. All rooftop mechanical
equipment shall be enclosed in a manner which complements the architectural
style of the building on which it is located.
   (g)   Off-Street Parking. In addition to the applicable regulations of
Chapter
1141, in multifamily developments, a minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street
parking space per dwelling unit shall be provided in unenclosed common parking
areas distributed throughout the development in a manner providing convenient
access to all dwelling units. (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1129.08 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Prohibited Activity.  The rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of an
automotive vehicle or the storage of motor or body parts in an open yard is
prohibited. The outside parking and storage of recreational vehicles is

and maintained in accordance with the following design regulations and
standards.
   (a)   Building Design. Retirement Living Center. The maximum length of any
main or accessory building wall shall be 100 feet. However, building length may
extend a maximum of 200 feet, provided that walls are offset or aligned at
angles as approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
   (b)   Building Design: Attached Single-Family. In order to enhance privacy
and to reduce the apparent mass of the buildings, the alignment of attached
single family buildings should be varied and the facades of not more than every
two dwelling units shall be offset by at least sixteen inches. No more than
eight units shall be located in one building.
   (c)   Building Design: General. To reduce the apparent mass of the
building's variations in such building elements as facade, width, color,
exterior materials, and roof lines shall be deemed desirable. Parallel
arrangements of buildings should be avoided. However, uniformity in design is
not expressly prohibited.
   (d)   Site Design. Retirement Living residential developments shall be
designed to complement the topography of the land in order to utilize natural
contours, economize in the construction of utilities, reduce required grading
and maximize the conservation of trees, watercourses and other natural
features. Natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site
shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations in the
arrangements of buildings, open spaces and accessory uses.
   (e)   Modifications to Area, Yard and Setback Requirements. With respect to
properties of irregular shape, or unusual topography the Planning and Zoning
Commission may modify requirements regarding areas, yards, setbacks and
distances between uses if compliance with these requirements is either clearly
infeasible or contrary to compliance with the design regulations and standards
of this section. However, the maximum permitted density shall not be increased
by reason of this provision. Applicants shall first seek modifications
permitted under this section prior to filing an application as set forth in
Section
 1111.03 for a variance for areas, yards, setbacks and distances between uses.
   (f)   Common Open Space. As required in Section
1131.03(f), at least 500 square feet of land per dwelling unit shall be

or water of such condition, size and shape as to be usable for active
recreation and/or scenic enjoyment as appropriate to the site, the surrounding
area, and the expected resident population. Such area shall contain no
structures other than those related to recreational use and shall not include
roads or parking areas.
         B.   Setback areas shall be excluded in the computation of common open
space.
         C.   Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of
common open space to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and
to place common open space within easy access and view of dwelling units.
Common open space shall not be separated from the development by existing
roads.
         D.   Common open space shall not be depleted, reduced in size or
converted to any other use.
      (2)   Ownership and maintenance.
         A.   The applicant shall submit copies of the proposed documents which
provide for the permanent preservation of open space at the time of application
for development. No application shall be approved until such documents are
acceptable to the Municipality and the Law Director in form and content.
         B.   Such common open space, including any recreational facilities
proposed to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly delineated on the
site plan together with descriptive data as to the methods to be employed to
preserve and maintain such open space.
         C.   In the event the open space is owned in common by more than one
owner directly or indirectly, a non-profit association shall be incorporated
under the laws of the State of Ohio and such association shall be the owner in
unencumbered fee simple title.
         D.   All common open space shown on the site plan must be subject to
legally enforceable declarations and restrictions. Such declarations and
restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the Municipality as a third-
party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must obtain approval of the Law
Director before final approval for development will be granted., The
declarations and restrictions shall grant enforcement rights to the
Municipality as a third-party beneficiary, and shall be reviewed by and must
obtain the approval of the Law Director before final approval for development
will be granted.
   (g)   Pedestrian Circulation. Each Retirement Living residential development
shall be served by a comprehensive walkway system adequately separated from
vehicular circulation, connecting residential buildings, parking areas,
recreation areas and health center buildings.
   (h)   Utility Equipment. All utility lines serving a Retirement Living
residential development shall be located underground. All rooftop mechanical
equipment shall be enclosed in a manner which complements the architectural
style of the building on which it is located.
      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
      1131.08 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
     In addition to the applicable regulations of Chapter
1141, the following parking regulations shall apply to attached single-family
developments in a Retirement Living District.
   (a)   Common Parking Areas. In attached single-family developments, a
minimum of one-half (0.5) off-street parking space per dwelling unit shall be
provided in unenclosed common parking areas distributed throughout the
developments in a manner providing convenient access to all dwelling units.
This requirement shall be in addition to the parking requirements of Chapter
1141.
   (b)   Garages. In attached single-family developments, each garage shall be
provided for the exclusive use of a single dwelling unit and shall be attached
to the residential structure which contains that unit. Such garages may be
attached to one another at side walls in order to improve design.

               (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1141.02 OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES; WHEN REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be determined in conformance with the schedule in Section
 1141.05 for the various office, institutional, residential, retail business,
industrial buildings and uses, and provided in conformance with the other
provisions of this chapter as a condition precedent to the occupancy of such
building or use.
   (a)   Central Shopping District.
      (1)   A change of one permitted use to another permitted use occupying
the existing floor area of a building shall not require parking greater than
that already provided for or allowed as a lawful non-conforming use for the
previous permitted use of such building.
      (2)   Parking facilities shall be provided for any additional parking
requirement resulting from an increase in the number of dwelling units, indoor
or outdoor seating capacity, floor area or number of establishments. For
purposes of this section "establishment" shall be considered a use or uses
occupying a space which is defined by exclusive access and walls separating
such use or uses from all other uses.
      (3)   Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building
whenever a new building is constructed.
   (b)   All Other Districts.
      (1)   Parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use

and walls separating such use or uses from all other uses.
                   (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1141.03 CONTINUATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   (a)   All off-street parking facilities, or those required as accessory to a
use of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in
operation, shall not be used for automobile service or repair and shall not be
reduced below the required size as long as the main use remains, unless an
equivalent number of spaces is provided for such use in another approved
location in accordance with this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   In order to insure the continued use for automobile parking purposes
of any areas established therefor, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require, before approval of same, evidence in writing that the owner or owners
of the land to be included in such automobile parking areas have by covenant
agreed to continue the use of such land for off-street parking accessory to the
residential, institutional, business or industrial use for which such parking
areas are required, such covenant first be reviewed and approved by the Law
Director, to be filed among the records of Cuyahoga County, and enforceable by
the Municipality.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1141.04 STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of determining accessory off-street parking requirements,
definitions and standards shall be as follows:
   (a)   "Accessory off-street parking space" means an open or enclosed area
that is not located in a dedicated right of way and that is accessible from a
street or alley for parking of motor vehicles of owners, occupants, employees,
customers or tenants of the main building or use. Except for one and two-family
dwellings, each space shall be not less than nine feet wide and 180 square feet
in area. Unless otherwise permitted to use a drive for parking, such required
parking spaces shall be exclusive of all drives, curbs and turning space. The
number of spaces shall be determined from an accurate plan of the area and the
regulations found in Sections
1141.04,
1141.05 and
1141.06.
   (b)   "Floor area" means the total area of all the floors measured from the
exterior faces of the building. Where building floor area is designated as the
standard for determining parking space requirements, floor area shall be the
total of all floor areas of the building, excluding stairwells and elevator
shafts, mechanical equipment rooms and utility rooms; provided however, that
such exclusions shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total floor area.
   (c)   "Seat" means the number of seating units installed or indicated, or
each twenty- four linear inches of benches, pews or space for loose chairs or
similar seating facilities; spacing of rows shall be thirty inches on center.
   (d)   "Employees" means the maximum number of employees on any two
successive shifts.
   (e)   Required Minimum Parking Spaces. Where the computation results in a
fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
   (f)   Parking facilities serving any dwelling shall be located on the same
lot as the dwelling served.
   (g)   No vehicle shall be parked so that any portion extends over any lot
line or public sidewalk.
   (h)   No off-street parking space shall be located so that any portion
extends over any lot line, public sidewalk or public right of way.

Other Buildings or Uses
For a specific building or use not scheduled above, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall apply the unit of measurement of the above schedule deemed to
be most similar to the parking required by the proposed building or use. If
the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that there is no listed use
similar to the proposed use, the Planning and Zoning Commission may refer to
the estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the American
Planning Association (APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and/or the
Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE).
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
      1141.06  MODIFICATIONS TO SCHEDULE.
      An existing building or use which does not conform to parking
requirements as set forth in Section
1141.05 and where land is not available on the same lot or adjoining lot, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the location of parking facilities to
permit such facilities within 400 feet walking distance of any customer
entrance to the building or use. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
permit such facilities only if it determines that the pedestrian route between
the parking area and the subject use is safe and does not necessitate unlawful
trespassing, and continuous parking is available pursuant to covenants in
compliance with Section
1141.03
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1141.07 SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking
spaces as required for the specific use.
   (b)   A building, or group of buildings, containing two or more uses,
operating normally during the same hours, and which have different off-street
parking requirements shall provide spaces for not less than the sum of the
spaces required for each use.
   (c)   Institutions (as set forth in the schedule in Section
 1141.05) may assume that up to, but not more than fifty percent (50%) of their
requirements may be shared in contiguous parking areas which are accessory to
business establishments and which normally have different hours of operation.
Provided however, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners,
there shall be covenants in compliance with Section
1141.03 covering a period of time as may be required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and provided, further, that should any of the uses be changed or the
facilities discontinued, then the required spaces for the use remaining shall
be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of such
building or buildings.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   
   1141.08 PEDESTRIAN AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY.
      To help insure the safety and convenience of motorists, pedestrians and

parking and loading areas. Safety features which the Planning Commission may
require to be installed include, but are not limited to:
   (a)   Raised pedestrian walkways.
   (b)   Crosswalks.
   (c)   Stop signs.
   (d)   Motor vehicle directional arrows.
   (e)   Continuous landscaped strips for pedestrian only traffic.
              (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1141.09  ACCESS DRIVES TO PARKING AREAS.
      The following standards shall apply to all off-street parking spaces,
except those required for one- and two-family dwellings:

   1142.01  INTENT.
      It is the intent of these regulations to achieve, among others, the
following purposes.
   (a)   To ensure that the open areas on developed lots are attractively
landscaped and maintained.
   (b)   To ensure that residential areas are adequately screened and buffered
from adjoining nonresidential developments.
   (c)   To preserve attractive visual landscapes along public streets.
               (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.02 APPLICABILITY.
      The regulations of this chapter shall apply to all zoning districts
except R1 and R2F Districts, which are regulated by provisions of Chapter
1125 and
1126.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.03  GENERAL LANDSCAPING.
      Any portion of a developed lot not used for permitted main and accessory
buildings or structures shall be landscaped with vegetative ground cover,
shrubs and trees in accordance with an overall landscaping plan acceptable to
the Municipality. Such landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. In
the development of property, existing trees and significant vegetation shall be
retained wherever feasible.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   
   1142.04  STREET TREES.
   (a)   General. A grass-covered strip of land at least seven feet in width
shall be provided and maintained contiguous to each property in a location
between the sidewalk (where one exists or is proposed), and the curb or
pavement edge of a contiguous public street. Such area shall be planted with
trees spaced at intervals of not more than thirty-five feet on centers at an
initial diameter of three inches at twelve inches above ground level.
   (b)   Tree Types. All tree varieties shall be from a list of approved trees
kept on file in the Building Department.
   (c)   Private Streets. The requirement for tree plantings shall also apply
to private streets in Attached Single Family, Multi-Family, Retirement Living,
Residential Mixed Use and Cluster Residential Districts. However, such trees
may be spaced at intervals greater than thirty-five feet, as approved by the
Administrator, in order to encourage the clustering of trees.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.05 PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   Perimeter Planting. A continuous landscaped strip of evergreen shrubs
planted at intervals of not more than five feet on centers and at initial
height of at least two feet shall be provided and maintained along any side of
a parking area which is located in a setback abutting a public street. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may permit alternative forms of planting if it
determines that the required planting is either infeasible or not in keeping
with an area's character.
   (b)   Interior Landscaping. Any single parking area with fifty or more
spaces shall utilize at least five percent (5%) of its area for landscaping
designed to interrupt the expanse of paved surface. In Attached Single Family,
Multi-Family, Residential Mixed Use, and Retirement Living Residential
Districts, landscaped islands shall be provided so that no row of parking
exceeds eight spaces in length. (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.06  PERIMETER SCREENS.
      A planted area designed to screen views and noise shall be provided along
certain lot lines separating uses which are not fully compatible. The location
and nature of such perimeter screens shall be in accordance with the following
regulations.
   (a)   Location of Screen. A perimeter planted screen shall be provided along
the following lot lines:
      (1)   On the property of a Retail or other Business, Office, or
Industrial District use that abuts a Residential, Park or Institutional
District use.
      (2)   On the property of a Multi-Family Residential, Attached Single-
Family, Residential Mixed Use or Retirement Living District use that abuts a R1
or R2F District use.
      (3)   Along the rear lot line of an Industrial District abutting a public
street.
   (b)   Nature of Screen. The planted area shall provide a continuous visual
screen to an initial height of at least eight feet. The screening effect shall
be achieved in a manner deemed appropriate by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. One appropriate method involves the planting of evergreen trees at
intervals of not more than ten feet on centers and at an initial height of at
least eight feet. Another appropriate method involves the planting of evergreen
shrubs at intervals of not more than five feet on centers used either along, if
sufficient in height, or as a supplement to a row of deciduous trees. Other
acceptable approaches include the use of landscaped earth mounds topped by
shrubbery.
   (c)   Exceptions. The screening requirement shall not apply where natural or
man-made barriers exist which will provide permanent screening generally
equivalent to that required.
      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.07 UTILITY USES.
      Maintenance facilities, sanitation facilities, storage facilities and
utility uses including but not limited to electrical substations, telephone
exchanges, communication related boxes and telephone terminal boxes located in
any district except Industrial Districts shall be governed by the following
landscaping and fencing regulations.
   (a)   Landscaping. Utility uses shall be substantially screened from view by
evergreen shrubbery and/or trees, as approved by the Administrator. Such
landscaping shall not be required along a lot line bordering an Industrial
District.
   (b)   Fencing. Utility uses shall be completely enclosed by a fence or wall
not less than five feet and not more than seven feet in height. The design and
construction of such fences shall be approved by the Architectural Board of
Review in consideration of factors of safety and visual impact on nearby uses.
For uses which do not present safety hazards, the Administrator may waive the
fencing requirement.
               (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
      1142.08  VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS.
     In all zoning districts, within a triangle formed by lines drawn between
points on two street right-of-way lines twenty-five feet from their point of
intersection, substantially unobstructed sight lines shall be maintained within
a vertical height band two and one-half to six feet above curb level.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1142.09 MAINTENANCE OF LANDSCAPING AND REPLACEMENT OF LANDSCAPING.
      All landscaping required by this Chapter
1142 shall be maintained in good condition and, when necessary, shall be
replaced with landscaping comparable to the landscaping required by the
approved landscape plan in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Any tree, shrub, or bush, due to its condition, shall be replaced, at
a minimum, with a tree, shrub, or bush that is comparable to the type and
height of the tree, shrub, or bush specified for initial planting in the
approved landscape plan.
   (b)   Any request to plant or maintain landscaping that is not comparable to
the landscaping required by the approved landscape plan shall be reviewed by
the Administrator and approved only if such landscaping is an improvement and
enhancement, as determined by the Administrator, to the originally approved
plan.
   (c)   The Administrator, in considering whether or not landscaping is an
improvement and enhancement, shall consider the intent of Chapter
1142, the need for a visual barrier, the intent of the original landscaping
plan, the adjacent properties, the current site conditions, including soil
conditions and the success of a certain species growing in the area, and any
other factor deemed relevant by the Administrator.

   (a)   Within the districts established by this Planning and Zoning Code and
amendments thereto or amendments that may later be adopted, buildings, lots and
uses of buildings and land prevail which were lawful before this Code was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this Code
or further amendments.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Code to permit such nonconformities to
continue until they are removed although they are considered to be incompatible
with the permitted uses in the districts involved.
   (c)   It is further the intent that nonconformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended, that nonconforming uses be changed only to a more
restrictive use, and that the rebuilding of a nonconforming building, if
substantially destroyed, shall be regulated in accordance with Section
 1145.02(d) of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   Furthermore, the continuation of a lawful nonconformity shall not be
construed as a reason for permitting nonconformities not specifically permitted
in this Code.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1145.02 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
      A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Planning
and Zoning Code became effective, but which does not currently conform as to
area or width of lot, setback, yard dimensions, lot coverage, height of
building or other structure, use intended or other regulations of the district
in which it is located, is a lawful nonconforming building. or other structure.
Such building or other structure may continue to be occupied or used so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Maintenance and Repair. A nonconforming building or other structure
may continue to be used, maintained and repaired, provided however no
structural parts shall be replaced except when required by law to restore to a
state of good repair or good condition, as defined in Chapter
1340 of the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality or to make the building, or
other structure conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Additions. A nonconforming building or other structure shall not be
altered, added to or enlarged unless the additions and original building or
other structure are made to conform to the yard, coverage and height
regulations of the district in which it is located, except a nonconforming
dwelling may be altered, modernized or enlarged provided the alterations and
enlargements conform to all the yard regulations and setbacks , and the
existing dwelling and the proposed enlargement combined shall meet the maximum
lot coverage regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (c)   Moving. A nonconforming building shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot or other premises, unless every portion
of such building so moved is made to conform to all regulations of the district
in which it is to be located.
   (d)   Restoration of Damaged Building. If a nonconforming building is
damaged or destroyed by any cause to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less
of its reproduction value, those portions so destroyed or damaged may be
restored but to no more than its former size, provided such restoration is
completed within a period of one year from date of damage or destruction. If
such building is occupied by a nonconforming use prior to damage, such use may
be continued. If a nonconforming building is damaged or destroyed more than
fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value, no repair or reconstruction
shall be made unless every portion of the building is made to conform to
regulations of the district in which the building is located and unless
occupied by a conforming use. Determination of the reproduction value shall be
made by majority vote of three practicing building construction contractors,
one to be appointed by owner, one to be appointed by the Municipality, and the
third to be selected by the mutual consent of the two parties, in the event the
Municipality and the owner do not agree on the value.
      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1145.03 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS; NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES.
   A use of a building existing lawfully at the time this Planning and Zoning
Code became effective, but which does not conform to the use regulations,
including the sign regulations, of the district in which it is located, is a
nonconforming use of a building and may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Change of Use. The nonconforming use of a building may only be changed
to a conforming use. Thereafter, it shall not be changed back to the former
nonconforming use. The term "change of use" shall not include changes within a
single use category
   (b)   Expansion of Use. A nonconforming use of part of a building may only
be expanded or extended throughout those parts of a building which were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Code that made the use nonconforming, but no such use shall
be extended so as to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   Discontinuance of Use. If a nonconforming use within a building or
portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, any future
use of such building or portion thereof, so discontinued, shall be in
conformity with the use regulations of the district in which the building is
located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs. Signs lawfully erected but made nonconforming by
adoption of this Planning and Zoning Code or amendments thereto, may be
maintained and repaired as authorized by the Administrator to ensure attractive
and safe conditions; however, such signs shall not be otherwise altered or
moved unless made to comply with all regulations of Chapter
1143. Further, any sign or part thereof which is removed, except for authorized
repairs or requires repairs of a cost which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its
reproduction value, shall not be rebuilt or relocated unless made to comply
with all regulations of Chapter
1143. Temporary and incidental signs shall not become lawful nonconforming
signs.
   (e)   Nonconforming Parking Facilities. A building or use existing lawfully
at the time this Planning and Zoning Code or an amendment thereto became
effective, but which does not conform with the off-street parking or off-street
loading regulations, may be occupied by the existing use without such parking
and/or loading facilities being provided. Any parking spaces that may be
provided shall be in accord with the regulations and standards set forth in
Chapter
1141. If an existing building is altered so that there is an increase of the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor area, or if the use is
changed to a use requiring more off-street facilities, then off-street parking
and loading facilities shall be provided at least equal to the number of spaces
required for the entire building or use in accord with the schedule as set
forth in Sections
1141.05 and
1141.13; provided, however, that if the building is located in the Central
Shopping District the owner or occupant shall not be required to provide
additional parking for the increased parking requirement unless it results from
an increase in the floor area due to an expansion of an existing building.
   (f)   Nonconforming as to Performance Standards. A building or use existing
lawfully at the time this Code became effective, but which is nonconforming as
to one or more of the performance standards shall not be required to conform
therewith except at such times that the use is changed or the building is
altered.
               (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
      1145.04 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
      A vacant lot or parcel of land, nonconforming as to use or dimension
(area or yard) and existing lawfully at the time this Planning and Zoning Code
or amendment thereto became effective but which does not conform with the use
and/or dimension regulations of the district in which it is located is a
nonconforming use of land, and such use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Expansion of Use. The nonconforming use of a lot, or part thereof,
shall not be expanded or extended onto other parts of the lot.
   (b)   Discontinuance of Use. If the nonconforming use of a lot, or part
thereof, is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, any future use of
such lot, or part thereof so discontinued, shall be in conformity with the use
regulations of the district in which it is located.
    (c)   Insufficient Size. A vacant lot of record which does not comply with
the area and/or width requirements of the district in which it is located on
the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code or any amendment thereto
may be used as follows:
      (1)   Single lots. If a vacant nonconforming lot does not adjoin another
lot with continuous frontage and under common ownership on the effective date
of this Code or applicable amendment thereto, such lot may be developed
provided that such development complies with all regulations of this Planning
and Zoning Code except those pertaining to lot width and area.
      (2)   Lots in combination. If a vacant nonconforming lot adjoins one or
more lots with continuous frontage and in common ownership on the effective
date of this Code or applicable amendment thereto, such lot shall be replatted
to create conforming lots as a prerequisite for development. Transfer of one or
more of such lots to a third party, in order to avoid the requirements of this
paragraph, shall result in a determination that the lots remain in common
ownership. However, if replatting of such lots cannot be effected reasonably
without resulting in an average lot width or area less than the minimum
required for the district, the Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce such
width and area requirements by not more than ten percent (10%).
                      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1145.05 NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   (a)   The foregoing provisions of this chapter shall also apply to the
buildings, structures, and or other uses hereafter becoming nonconforming as a
result of reclassification of districts or of other amendments made to this
Planning and Zoning Code or of future reclassification of districts or of other
amendments made thereto.
   (b)   Buildings and uses that were conforming or lawfully existing
nonconforming buildings and uses under Ordinance 1932-144 as amended and become
nonconforming under this Code shall be deemed lawful nonconforming buildings
and uses.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
      1145.06  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   (a)   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it complies with the requirements of the district in which it is
located and shall not be resumed thereafter.
   (b)   A proposed building conforming in all respects to the Planning and
Zoning Code shall be permitted on the same zoning lot as a nonconforming
building or use provided the lot area, lot width and number of parking spaces
allocated to the nonconforming building or use and the proposed conforming
building equal the sum of the lot area, lot width and parking spaces required
for each use; and provided the distances between the conforming building and
nonconforming building or use are at least equal to the distances required if
the two uses were on adjacent lots; provided however, that in a one-family and
two-family district only one main building shall be permitted on a zoning lot.

      In order to maintain and enhance the distinctive historic character of
the Municipality these regulations are established to achieve, among others,
the following objectives:
   (a)   To foster a sense of community identification; and civic pride by
preserving structures which reflect periods and events in the history of the
community and its region;
   (b)   To stimulate the local economy by encouraging investment in historic
resources and protecting the community assets which support current retail
activity;
   (c)   To protect property values within the Municipality by preventing
environmental changes which diminish the area's unique historic character;
   (d)   To recognize the importance of preserving structures that contribute
to the traditional village land use pattern; and
   (e)   To avoid demolition of or incompatible alterations to historic
structures.
             (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1146.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   No building or other structure in the Municipality shall be erected,
altered in exterior construction or appearance, enlarged, moved or demolished
unless such action complies with the provisions of this chapter. Applicability
of these provisions is limited to structures of historic significance and sites
in proximity to such structures. See Section
1146.05 for an explanation of terms.
   (b)   The painting of buildings and structures shall not be governed by
these regulations. For the purposes of this Chapter a structure shall include
building or a portion thereof.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
    1146.03 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
      The following procedures are established to govern the processing of
applications for building permits and other municipal authorizations in
accordance with the regulations of this chapter.
   (a)   Mandatory Referral.
      (1)   As directed by Section
1109.05(b)(1), all requests for building permits shall be referred to the
Architectural Board of Review for a determination of compliance with this
Chapter. The Architectural Board of Review may obtain the assistance of an
expert in historic architecture to assist it in determining whether a proposed
project satisfies the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   All requests for demolition of a structure or portion of a
structure which is more than fifty (50) years old shall be accompanied by a
deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00). All requests to make an addition to
or alteration of a structure or portion of a structure which is more than fifty
(50) years old shall be accompanied by a deposit of three hundred dollars
($300.00). As provided below, the request shall be referred to the
Architectural Board of Review with a recommendation from the Administration as
to whether or not the structure is a Historically Significant Property. The
Architectural Board of Review shall apply the standards set forth in Section
1146.06 hereof to determine whether or not demolition is permitted.
         A.   Advice of Expert on Historic Significance.  When an applicant
requests a permit to demolish a structure or portion thereof that is more than
fifty (50) years old, the Administrator shall engage the assistance of an
expert in the field of the history of architecture, who shall make a
recommendation to the Architectural Board of Review regarding whether or not
the structure is an Historically Significant Property, as defined by Section
1146.05 of this Chapter. The expert shall be paid out of the deposit made
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) hereof, and the remaining funds from such deposit,
if any, shall be returned to the applicant.
         B.   Advice of Expert on Economic Feasibility. If, in reviewing a
request for demolition, a majority of the Architectural Board of Review, by
motion, requests the advice of an expert to assist in the analysis of
determining whether or not the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of an
Historically Significant Property is Economically Feasible, the Administrator
shall determine whether the Municipality should engage an expert at
Municipality expense, to provide such advice.
         C.   Advice of Expert on Additions and Alterations. When an applicant
requests a permit to add to, or in any material way (other than painting) alter
the exterior of, any structure that is more than fifty (50) but less than one
hundred (100) years old, the Administrator shall engage the assistance of an
expert in the field of the history of architecture, who shall make a
recommendation to the Architectural Board of Review regarding whether or not
the structure is a Historically Significant Property, as defined by Section
1146.05 of this Chapter, and whether the proposed addition or alteration is
Compatible with the existing structure and other historic structures
in proximity thereto. When the structure, or a portion thereof has been
determined by the Municipality to be at least 100 years old, it shall be
presumed to be a Historically Significant Property and the advice of an expert
shall not be required unless the Administrator needs such assistance to
determine the age of the structure, or a portion thereof. The Administrator
shall obtain the expert opinion to determine if the proposed material change
will have an adverse effect on the Historical Significance of the structure.
The expert shall be paid out of the deposit made pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)
hereof, and the remaining funds from such deposit shall be returned to the
applicant.
      (3)   Where an applicant for a building permit proposes to change the
existing grade of a lot by more than three (3) inches, the Architectural Board
of Review shall review, in accordance with Section
1109.05 and this Chapter
1146 of this Planning and Zoning Code, such change to ensure that the proposed
building elevations and site grading are compatible with contiguous property
and that the proposed building meets the standards set forth in Section
 1115.04, failing which the Architectural Review Board shall deny approval of
such grade change.
   (b)   Approval/Disapproval. The Architectural Board of Review shall either
approve, approve with modification or disapprove the application in accordance
with the review and approval procedures set forth in Section
1109.05. In conjunction with a motion to grant the request of the applicant,
the members of the Architectural Board of Review shall identify facts which
have been presented to the Architectural Board of Review which the members
believe are supportive of their decision in the case. It is not sufficient for
the Architectural Board of Review to identify the ultimate fact to be
determined (e.g., Compatibility or Historic Significance), but the members of
the Architectural Board of Review, when stating or voting on the motion to
grant the request of the applicant(s), shall identify the specific facts
presented in the matter before them which cause them to reach their conclusion
and support their vote; if a member states facts with which a second member
agrees, the second member may indicate so, generally, and/or may distinguish
his or her findings relative to facts previously stated. The facts identified
and agreed upon by a majority of the Architectural Board of Review shall be
deemed the Conclusions of Fact of the Architectural Board of Review; provided
that if no majority vote is obtained, the motion shall be deemed defeated and
facts adopted by those who voted in opposition to the motion shall be deemed
the Conclusions of Fact of the Architectural Board of Review.
   (c)   Notifications.  The Architectural Board of Review shall notify the
applicant in writing of the time and location of its meeting. Subsequent to
that meeting, the Architectural Board of Review shall notify the applicant in
writing of its determination, stating reasons for a determination of
disapproval.
   (d)   Appeal. Any interested party may appeal the determination of the
Architectural Board of Review to the Board of Zoning Appeals, in accordance
with the terms of Chapter
1111 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (e)   Mandatory Stay of Demolition. No permit to demolish shall be issued by
the Administrator for thirty (30) days following the final administrative
adjudication by the Municipality, and in the event the appellate court(s)
reviewing the matter issue a stay, no demolition permit shall be issued pending
the final outcome of the administrative appeal.
             (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
    1146.04 STANDARDS OF REVIEW.
   In its review of applications, the Architectural Board of Review shall:
   (a)   Consider the historical and architectural nature of existing
buildings, signs and structures within the Municipality and the compatibility
of proposed changes or proposed new buildings, signs and structures with such
existing buildings, signs and structures;
   (b)   Consider the design standards of Section
1146.08; and
   (c)   Follow the guidelines set forth below:
      (1)   Preservation of features.  The distinguishing original qualities or
character of a Historically Significant Property shall not be destroyed.
Removal or alteration of historic material or distinctive architectural
features shall be avoided.
      (2)   Replacement of features. Consistent with the concept of responsible
property maintenance, deteriorated or damaged architectural features shall be
repaired rather than replaced. In the event that the Architectural Board of
Review determines that replacement of architectural features on a Historically
Significant Property is necessary, the new material should closely match the
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities.
      (3)   Compatibility.  Alterations, additions and new development shall be
compatible in scale, material and character with the design of the subject
property and any structure more than fifty (50) years old in Proximity to the
subject property. New structures may be constructed in accordance with a
different architectural style than Historically Significant Properties.
      (4)   Contemporary design. All structures shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations, additions and new development which have no
historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall not be
required. Conversely, compatible contemporary design shall not be prohibited or
discouraged except where such design would clearly detract from the
architectural unity of an ensemble or group of Historically Significant
Properties.
      (5)   Cleaning.  The surface cleaning of Historically Significant
Property shall be undertaken by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall
not be permitted.
      (6)   Accessory structures. Fences, walkways, street lights, and other
accessory structures located in Proximity to structures more than (50) years
old shall be compatible in design with the character of such properties.
      (7)   Signs. In addition to meeting the requirements of Chapter
1143, signs located on or in proximity to Historically Significant Properties
shall be compatible in color, material, placement and character with the
architectural style of such Properties.
   (d)   Apply the following burdens of proof when evaluating applications
under this Chapter:
      (1)   Any person asserting that a structure is an Historically
Significant Property bears the burden of proving the assertion by clear and
convincing evidence; provided, that any structure which is more than one
hundred (100) years old shall be presumed to be an Historically Significant
Property, and any party asserting that such structure is not a Historically
Significant Property shall bear the burden of proving the same by clear and
convincing evidence.
      (2)   If new construction is proposed, the design of the new construction
shall be permitted unless it is proven, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the new building is not compatible with any structure more than fifty (50)
years old that is in Proximity to the proposed new building. Nothing herein
shall limit the authority of the Architectural Board of Review to require a
property owner to adhere to proper architectural principles in the design, use
of materials, finished grade lines and orientation of the construction of the
new building or to make recommendations to the applicant regarding the proposed
design.
      (3)   If an addition to, or exterior alteration of, an existing
Historically Significant Property is proposed, the applicant shall bear the
burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the proposed addition
or alteration is consistent with the historically significant features of the
structure such that the historically significant features shall be preserved.
      (4)   If a party proposes the demolition of a Historically Significant
Property, that party bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing
evidence, that the demolition is permissible pursuant to Section
 1146.06 hereof.
                        (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1146.05 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning given
herein:
   (a)   A "Historically Significant Property" means (i) any structure which is
more than one hundred (100) years old, or, (ii) any structure that is fifty
(50) years old and:
      (1)   Is listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior); or preliminarily
determined by the Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board as meeting the
requirements for individual listings on the National Register; or
      (2)   Is certified or preliminarily determined by the Ohio Historic Site
Preservation Advisory Board as contributing to the historical significance of a
registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Ohio
Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board to qualify as a registered historic
district; or
      (3)   Consistent with the criteria used to determine National Register
eligibility, possesses one or more of the following attributes:
         A.   Is associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of Municipality history; or
         B.   Is associated with the lives of persons significant in the
Municipality's past; or
         C.   Is a structure which:
            1.   Embodies the distinctive local characteristics of a type,
period or method of construction; or
            2.   Represents the work of a local Master as defined herein; or
            3.   Possesses high artistic values; or
         D.   Has yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in
the prehistory or history of the Municipality.
   (b)   "Compatible" for the purposes of this chapter means that a design does
not materially and adversely impact the economic or historical value of a
Historically Significant Property.
   (c)   "Proximity" for the purpose of determining compatibility of design
pursuant to Section
1146.04 means the potential for one property, by virtue of its location, to
materially and adversely affect an Historically Significant Property.
   (d)   "Economically Feasible" means that the costs of the necessary repair
and rehabilitation of a Historically Significant Property, when combined with
the market value of the land upon which the Historically Significant Property
resides, do not exceed the market value of the real property after the
necessary repair and rehabilitation of the Historically Significant Property
has been completed, based on the reasonable expectations in the marketplace for
comparably aged and constructed homes by an amount beyond what a willing and
reasonably prudent buyer would agree to pay for a Historically Significant
Property in that area of the Municipality.
   (e)   "Preservation" means the act or process of applying measures necessary
to sustain the existing form, integrity and material of a Historically
Significant Property.
   (f)   "Restoration" means the returning of a historically significant
building to its original condition or to its condition at a specifically
identified time in its history as it has evolved, based on supporting visual
and documentary evidence and physical analysis of the property. The intent of
restoration is to accurately restore the character-defining historical elements
of the property to their original or selected later date appearance when it
achieved its historical importance. Conjectural restoration is not acceptable.
   (g)   "Repair" means the fixing or mending of a building that has suffered
natural or man-made damage due, for example, to wind, water, fire, vandalism or
long-term failure to properly maintain it. Repair does not imply, nor does it
encourage restoration, although it may become part of the process for a
building undergoing restoration.
   (h)   "Rehabilitation" means the renovation of a building, in its present
condition, for continued use, or its adaptation to a new use. To meet the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, the owner must retain
the surviving historically-important, character-defining components of the
building but is not required to restore it to its original historical
appearance or configuration, which may have changed over the years.
   (i)   "Reconstruction" means the building of a replica of a structure, or
portion thereof, that has been destroyed, based upon supporting visual and
documentary evidence and, possibly surviving fragments. This technique is
rarely used and is usually confined to archaeological sites.
   (j)   "Master" means a figure of generally recognized greatness in a field,
a known craftsman of consummate skill, or an anonymous craftsman whose work is
distinguishable from others by its characteristic style and quality. The
property must express a particular phase in the development of the master's
career, an aspect of the master's work, or a particular idea or theme in the
master's craft.
      (Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1146.06 DEMOLITION AND MOVING.
   (a)   Demolition Prohibited; Exceptions.  The demolition of a Historically
Significant Property shall not be permitted unless one of the following
conditions exist:
      (1)   Demolition has been ordered by the Administrator for public safety
because of an unsafe or dangerous condition that constitutes an emergency.
      (2)   The owner demonstrates that the Historically Significant Property
is either not habitable or otherwise not safe; or the Repair or Rehabilitation
of the structure is not Economically Feasible and the property's condition did
not result from damage which has been purposefully caused to the property, or
allowed to occur due to the neglect of the owner or previous owners with the
likely intention of making the Repair or Rehabilitation of the structure not
Economically Feasible. No permit to demolish will be permitted under this
paragraph (a)(2) or (3) hereof unless the owner or owner's representative
obtains final approval from the Architectural Board of Review for the structure
(s) which will replace the structure to be demolished.
      (3)   The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Architectural
Board of Review that denial of the demolition is inconsistent with a legitimate
interest in the health, safety and welfare of the Municipality.
      (4)   The demolition request is for an inappropriate addition or a
portion of a structure that is not historically significant, and, the
demolition will not adversely affect those parts of the structure that are
found to be a Historically Significant Property as determined by the
Architectural Board of Review.
   
   (b)   Moving.  No Historically Significant Property may be moved from its
current location unless the Architectural Board of Review determines that the
moving of the structure will not materially and adversely impact the historical
character of the structures more than 50 years old in Proximity.
(Ord. 2019-39. Passed 8-13-19.)
   1146.07 MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or delay the
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of a structure or feature which has
been ordered by the Administrator upon certification of an unsafe condition
constituting an emergency.
   (b)   Similarly, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to govern or
restrict routine maintenance activities, which do not represent alterations in
exterior appearance.
   (c)   The owner of any structure, even if vacant and uninhabited, shall
provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure its
perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration. This provision
shall be in addition to all other applicable provisions of the Building Code.

development and their protection. The Hillside Protection Regulations are
established to achieve, among others, the following objectives:
   (a)   To permit development on hillside areas while conserving and promoting
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare by minimizing
disruption to slope stability, water run-off and soil erosion problems incurred
in adjustment of the topography to meet development needs;
   (b)   To use generally accepted design, landscape architecture,
architecture, civil engineering, and geotechnical engineering to preserve,
enhance and promote the existing and future safety of hillside areas;
   (c)   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape by
encouraging the maximum retention of natural topographic features such as
natural drainage swales, streams, slope ridge lines, rock outcroppings, vistas
from and of the hillsides, trees and other natural plant formations and to
retain the sense of identity and image that the hillside areas now impart to
the Municipality;
   (d)   To maximize the natural environmental value of hillside areas as well
as their scenic beauty and to protect public and private property owners from
the potential damage to human life and safety and property damage that could be
caused by increased hillside instability;
   (e)   To assure access to properties that have hillside areas by emergency,
police and fire vehicles and personnel to protect persons and property; and,
   (f)   To preserve and protect the unique scenic resources and scenic river
habitats in the Municipality.

Commission.
   (q)   Approval of Final Plat by Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning
and Zoning Commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat at the next
regularly scheduled meeting which occurs seven days or more after official
acceptance of the application by the Administrator. The Commission shall make
its final determination no later than thirty-five days after the date of its
required initial consideration. Failure of the Commission to act upon the final
plat within such time shall be deemed as approval of the plat. If the plat is
disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated in the records of the
Commission and a copy of such record shall be forwarded to the subdivider. The
Commission shall not disapprove the final plat if the developer has done
everything that he was required to do and has proceeded in accordance with the
conditions and standards specified in the approved preliminary plat. If
disapproved, the subdivider shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit
the final plat within thirty days to the Commission for it final approval. If a

(Ord. 1988-25. Approved by voters 11-8-88.)
   1161.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Design Standards Statement. The provisions of this chapter shall
control the manner in which streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision
are arranged on the land. These planning controls shall insure convenient and
safe streets, creation of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities
and reservation of land for open spaces.
   (b)   Design Review. The Planning and Zoning Commission has responsibility
for reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its design
development. The Commission shall insure that all of the requirements in this
chapter are met.
   (c)   Conformity to Zoning Districts. Individual lot and building
specifications shall be in accordance with the zoning districts and regulations
listed in Chapter
1119 to Chapter
1139, inclusive.
   (d)   Physical Considerations.
      (1)   Natural land use. Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage
of the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil, and to preserve such
natural features as watercourses, unusual rock formations, large trees, sites
of historical significance and other assets which if preserved will add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision and the community.
      (2)   Suitability of land. The Planning and Zoning Commission, with the
advice of the Village Engineer, shall review and determine if land proposed to
be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding,
inadequate drainage, topography, inadequate water supply, seasonal high water
table limitations, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
the features or conditions which will be hazardous to the safety, health and
general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or
its surrounding area.
   (e)   Street Design. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade,
construction and location of all streets shall conform to the standards and
specifications of the Village Engineer and to Chapters
901 to
905. They shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, so that the entire area can be served with a coordinated public street
system. The width of the right of way should be provided so that all
underground utilities can be located outside of pavement areas.
   (f)   Street Classification.
      (1)   Arterial streets. Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for
continuation of movement of traffic between points of heavy traffic generation
and from one section of the community to another. They shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible.
      (2)   Local streets. Local streets shall provide direct and full access
to each lot and shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets
shall be in general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous
development of the entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the
boundaries of the tract to be recorded unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, such extension is not necessary nor desirable for the coordination
of the layout of the subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts. Dead-
end streets or cul-de-sacs shall be approved only when necessitated by
topography or other physical conditions or where they are appropriate for the
type of development contemplated.
         Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed major
arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
      (3)   Street right-of-way widths and grades.
 
                                        Minimum       Grades
                                        Right-of-Way  by Percent
Classification                          Width in Feet Maximum Minimum
Major arterial thoroughfare             60*           6       0.5
Collector, commercial and local streets 60*           12      0.5
* Indicates a minimum ten-foot easement to be adjacent to the proposed
right-of-way lines on both sides of the streets.
      (4)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where there
is an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision, in which case the
remaining half of the street shall be platted.
      (5)   Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets. Streets designed to be permanent
cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 750 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement radius of at least 37.5
feet and a street right-of-way line radius of at least 62.5 feet with a paving
diameter of ninety feet.
         If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension into
adjacent land is anticipated, then such turning circle beyond the normal street
width shall be in the nature of an easement. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners when the dead-end street is
legally extended into adjacent land.
      (6)   Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than twenty-five feet or as required by the
Village Engineer.
      (7)   Horizontal curves. Angles in the alignment of street lines shall be
connected by a curve with a radius on the centerline of not less than 300 feet
for local streets, 800 feet for collector streets and 1,200 feet for major
arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent at
least 100 feet long on major arterial thoroughfares.
      (8)   Intersections. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than seventy degrees. In no event shall an intersection
containing streets in excess of four legs be considered unless specifically
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (9)   Street centerline offsets (jogs). Street jogs with centerline
offsets shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and Village Engineer.
   (g)   Easements.
      (1)   Utility easements. Adequate easements along rear or side lot lines
shall be provided for utilities where necessary. A ten-foot easement on each
front lot line for utilities is required.
      (2)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
way, a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines
of such drainage way shall be provided. The easement shall be a minimum of
twenty feet or as the Village Engineer may require.
      (3)   Utility lines. All utility lines including electric, telephone and
cable television shall be located underground wherever possible.
   (h)   Lots.
      (1)   Zoning conformance. The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall meet at a minimum the existing Zoning Regulations,
except where the Commission and Village Engineer determine the Hillside
Protection Regulations apply.
      (2)   Access to public streets. The subdividing of land whether as major
or minor subdivision, shall provide each lot with the required frontage for the
district in which it is zoned (fifty, sixty or 100 feet of continuous
frontage). For lots which front on a curved street segment, the minimum street
frontage required herein shall be reduced in proportion to the degree of
curvature. The minimum permitted street frontage for such lots shall be that
distance which results from side lot lines drawn as radials of the circle(s)
formed from the front lot line. This standard may be reduced by the Planning
and Zoning Commission for lots fronting on a permanent cul-de-sac.
      (3)   Lot lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street lines. Lot lines should follow Municipal boundary lines rather
than across them.
      (4)   Minimum lot depth. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half
times the lot width or less than one and one-half times the width unless
otherwise approved by the Commission. The lot width shall be measured at the
minimum building setback line.
      (5)   Double frontage lot. A double frontage lot shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from major
arteries or specific disadvantages of topography.
   (i)   Public Sites and Open Space. The developer is encouraged to give
consideration to preserving outstanding natural features such as scenic spots,
water bodies or groves of trees.
   (j)   Flood Areas and Storm Drain Sewers. In order to protect the health,
safety and general welfare of the people, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall reject any proposed subdivision located in an area subject to a hundred
year flood as found in the Flood Insurance Rate Maps. If the subdivision is
located in an area having poor drainage or other adverse physical
characteristics, the Commission may approve the subdivision based on the advice
of the Village Engineer, provided the subdivider agrees to perform such
improvements as will render the area safe for the intended use. In lieu of
improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a surety or certified check covering
the cost of the required improvements.
(Ord. 1988-25. Approved by voters 11-8-88.)
   1161.06 REQUIRED CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENTS.

      (2)   Terms. The terms of such guarantees shall be determined by Council;
however, they shall not be for a longer period than two years unless Council,
by resolution, extends the time. Bonds shall be executed by the applicant as
principal with a surety company authorized in the State.
      (3)   Amount of guarantee. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total cost of materials and labor required to install or
construct the improvements, plus fifteen percent (15%) for engineering and
legal fees and contingencies. Such costs shall be determined by the Village
Engineer. When any portion of an improvement has, upon inspection, been found
satisfactorily completed, a reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of
funds equal to the estimated costs of such completed improvements may be
authorized by the Village Engineer and Administrator.
      (4)   Progressive installation. The developer may apply for final
approval and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such
a progressive unit development procedure, the installation of required
improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the
subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
   (e)   Street Maintenance Deposit or Bond.
      (1)   The developer shall guarantee the construction and materials of the
street pavement for a two-year period after acceptance by the Municipality and
all other improvements for a twelve-month period after acceptance by the
Municipality. In order to secure the guarantee, he shall deposit with the
Municipality an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the
construction of street improvements in a maintenance fund or furnish a
maintenance bond equal to ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the
construction of street improvements.
      (2)   Insurance. The subdivider shall furnish such insurance as is deemed
necessary by the Law Director or which has a minimum equal coverage to the
insurance the Municipality carries, which shall indemnify and save harmless the
Municipality from any and all liability arising by reason of the unimproved
conditions of the streets of such subdivision which may arise or grow out of
the construction or installment of such facilities when undertaken. The
insurance shall be of such duration, amount and form as determined by the Law
Director but shall in no case be allowed to expire earlier than the effective
period of any maintenance bond. A copy of the insurance policy shall remain at
all times with the Clerk of the Municipality.
      (3)   Permits. The Administrator shall not issue building permits for any
structure on a lot in a subdivision for which a plat has not been approved and
recorded in the manner prescribed herein.
   (f)   Failure to Complete Improvements. In the event the developer fails to
complete the installation of required improvements according to the terms and
conditions of the agreement, the Municipality, upon proper notice, may complete
the same and appropriate such necessary portion of the money or bonds posted
for the faithful performance of such work. Further, the Village can pursue any
and all other legal remedies available, either criminal or civic, for
enforcement of the provisions of these Regulations, and to obtain the full
cost, administrative and legal, for completing such improvements, or causing

Building Inspector, such plans are unnecessary. It shall be the duty of the
Inspector to examine plans and, upon approval, to stamp and attach his
signature to each of the three sets submitted. He shall retain two of the
stamped approved sets for his files and deliver one set to the applicant at the
time of issuing the permit. A stamped and approved set of drawings shall be
kept on the job for which a permit is issued from the beginning of construction

(Ord. 1965-616. Passed 6-14-65.)
   (d)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Inspector, the plans submitted include
structural members, the size, proportions or design of which necessitate
approval by a qualified structural engineer, he may require the applicant to
furnish certification as to the sufficiency of the design by a registered
structural engineer. The form of certification shall be subject to the approval
of the Inspector.
(Ord. 1980-5. Passed 1-28-80.)
   (e)   The Inspector may waive the requirements as to certification when, in

correctly describe the work to be performed, including the types and grades of
materials to be used, the manner in which the work is to be performed and the
make and grade of manufactured products, with complete, identifying
descriptions of equipment to be installed.

contained upon any such drawings or specifications filed with the Building
Inspector. If during the progress of the execution of such work, it is desired
to deviate in any manner affecting the construction or other essential of the
building from the terms of the application, plans or specifications, notice of
such intention to alter or deviate shall be given in writing to the Inspector
and his written assent shall be obtained before such alteration or deviation
may be made. If such change or deviation affects the bearing or structural
parts of such building, or its classification or grade of occupancy, new plans
thereof shall be submitted to the Inspector for approval.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)

   1307.01 BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED; APPLICATION; PLANS AND DRAWINGS.
   (a)   Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration.
repair or removal of any building or other structure, a permit shall be first
obtained by the owner or his agent from the Building Inspector. Such permit
must be obtained before the commencement of any work, including excavations, is
performed on the premises in connection with any construction, enlargement,
alteration, repair or removal of any building or other structure. The
application shall be made in writing and upon printed forms furnished by the
Inspector and shall, except for removals, be accompanied by a complete set of
plans and working drawings conforming to the requirements of Chapter
1305. In addition to the above plans, and where heating equipment is to be
installed, there shall be submitted, at the time of applying for a building
permit, an approved set of heating plans in accordance with Section
1307.15. When plans and drawings are found to conform to the requirements of
this Building Code and the Zoning Code, and such plans and drawings have been
approved by the Architectural Board of Review as provided in Section
137.08 of the Administrative Code, the Inspector shall issue a permit, except
as otherwise provided by ordinance or statute, which permit shall be effective
for one year from the date of its issuance.
(Ord. 1955-350. Passed 10-10-55.)
   (b)   Whenever any board, commission, or official (collectively "Approving
Authority") has been delegated the power to approve plans, issue permits and/or
to approve development, construction, reconstruction or renovation of land,
buildings or structures within the Village, such Approving Authority may impose
conditions, so long as such conditions are in compliance with any applicable
statutes, ordinance and standards, on such approval with such conditions that
the Approving Authority believes are necessary to impose in order that the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare of the resident
and the Village may be safeguarded and substantial justice done.
(Ord. 2022-19. Passed 6-13-22.)
   1307.02 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH ZONING CODE.
   Before the issuance of a building permit, the Building Inspector shall
certify in writing upon the plans, or attached thereto, that the building,
alteration or repair proposed to be done thereunder will conform to all of the
provisions of the Zoning Code, including, but not limited to, setback, side and
rear yard requirements and height and floor space requirements.
(Ord. 1955-350. Passed 10-10-55.)
   1307.03 BONDS.
   No building permit shall be issued unless and until the applicant for such
permit deposits with the Director of Finance a cash bond in the amount of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) as a guarantee that adequate protection will be
provided and that no damage will be done to any curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert in connection with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building. Such deposit shall also guarantee that no
dirt, mud, building material or other nuisance will be deposited or left upon
the streets, sidewalks, tree lawns or in the ditches of the Municipality in
connection with such construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal.
If such damage, deposit or nuisance is not corrected or removed by the
permittee, the Building Inspector shall charge the cost thereof to such
depositor. In the event the sum so deposited is not sufficient to pay such cost
and expense, the permittee or the owner of the property shall be liable to the
Municipality for any balance remaining. Such deposit shall also be held by the
Inspector as a guarantee that when any opening is made in any street or public
ground or tree lawn in connection with the work performed pursuant to such
permit, such permittee will promptly and at the proper time, or at such times
as instructed by the Inspector, replace and restore the street, pavement,
sidewalk, tree lawn or other public property over any such opening to as good a
state and condition as found previous to opening the same. Such deposit shall
be held for such purposes and also in accordance with the provisions of Section
 1307.11 and the provisions of Chapter
901. Upon the completion of the work for which a permit has been granted, and
when the Inspector is satisfied that all the conditions and requirements
provided for herein have been satisfied, such deposit or any unused portion
thereof may be returned to the permittee.
   Where an application for a permit involves industrial or commercial
construction, the Inspector may require a larger cash bond, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000), commensurate with the size of buildings and the
possible damage to public streets, subject to all
of the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 2006-47. Passed 7-24-06.)
   1307.04 PERMIT TO ERECT PART OF BUILDING.
   The Building Inspector may require complete plans and specifications before
issuing a permit for any part of contemplated work but nothing in this Building
Code shall prevent the Inspector from issuing a permit for the erection of part
of a building or structure, where the plans and detailed statements have been
presented for the same, before the entire plans and detailed statements of such
building or structure have been submitted, provided that a complete set of all
such plans and working drawings as prescribed in Section
1307.01 is placed on file before the foundation wall is brought to grade or to
a height to receive the first tier of beams, girders or joists.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.05 PERMITS FOR SUPERSTRUCTURE.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
1307.05 was repealed by Ordinance 1980-5, passed January 28, 1980.)
   
   1307.06 PERMITS FOR MINOR INTERIOR REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
1307.06 was repealed by Ordinance 1980-5, passed January 28, 1980.)
   1307.07 WATER PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No permit for the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal
of any building or structure within this Municipality shall become effective
until the right has been secured from the Chief Administrative Officer or other
proper authority to use the water necessary for the work called for by such
permit, or the necessary water has been otherwise properly contracted for. No
person shall perform any of the work called for by such permit, except
excavating, leveling or any operation not entailing actual construction, before
water has been provided for as required herein.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.08 REVOCATION OF PERMIT FOR DELAY.
   If construction work for which a building permit has been issued is not
begun within thirty days after the date of the permit, the Building Inspector
may, at his option, cancel the permit or serve notice in writing addressed to
the individual or company to whom the permit was issued providing for such
further notice to the Building Inspector as in his opinion may be necessary
before starting work under the permit. Should work which has been started be
delayed to such an extent, in the judgment of the Inspector, to justify similar
notice regarding recommencing work, he may, at his option, issue notice in the
manner provided for in this section. Failure on the part of those in charge of
such work to comply with such notice shall be considered a violation of this
Building Code. Should the delays, in the judgment of the Inspector, be such as
to justify revocation of the permit, he may revoke the permit by written notice
addressed as above.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.09 RESTORATION UPON PERMIT REVOCATION.
   Upon revocation of any building permit all street openings must be properly
backfilled, pavements, sidewalks and tree lawns restored to the condition in
which they were before work was begun and the site of the operations must be
cleared of surplus dirt and refuse and restored to a condition acceptable to
the Building Inspector. Upon failure of those responsible for the operations to
make such repairs and restoration, the Inspector may use so much of the deposit
made in connection with the issuing of the permits as, in his judgment, may be
necessary to repair and restore the street and the site of the operation.
Should the deposit be insufficient to complete the repairs and restoration, the
Inspector may, upon authorization by Council, complete the repairs and
restoration, in which event all costs and expenses, over and above the portion
of the deposit used for this purpose, shall become a lien on the property
described in the building permit.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.10 REVOCATION FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   When, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, work is not being performed
in accordance with approved plans and specifications, or when, in his opinion,
materials or equipment delivered on the work do not conform to standards
provided for in the plans and specifications, or when, in his opinion,
workmanship, materials or equipment are not in conformity with the requirements
of this Building Code, or when the manner of performing any of the work
provided for in the permit is in violation of any ordinance or regulation of
the Municipality, the Inspector may order the discontinuance of all work under
the permit.
   If the work is not immediately discontinued or corrected to the satisfaction
of the Inspector, he may revoke the permit. In ordering discontinuance of work
it shall be necessary only that notice be given to the individuals in immediate
charge of the operation which is being improperly performed, or in which the
unsatisfactory materials are being incorporated. If the permit is to be
revoked, it shall be necessary only to mail notice of such revocation to the
individual, firm or corporation in whose name the permit was issued, at the
address named in the application for permit. Failure to comply with the orders
of the Inspector or to discontinue operations immediately after the revocation
of a permit shall be a violation of this Building Code.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.11 DEPOSIT TO COVER REPAIRS.
   It shall be the duty of all those engaged in the work for which a building
permit has been issued to take such precautions as the Building Inspector may
request in the protection of municipal property, including pavements, curbing,
tree lawns, trees, sidewalks and property of adjoining owners. Damage to
municipal property not repaired within five days after notice to repair from
the Inspector may be repaired in such manner as the Inspector may determine and
the cost of such repairs may be deducted from the cash deposited as provided in
Section
1307.03. Should the deposit be insufficient to cover such repairs and all other
work for which it is security, and the resulting deficit is not paid into the
Municipal Treasury within thirty days after completion of the work, such
deficit shall become a lien on the property on which the construction work was
authorized and shall be collected as other taxes are collected. A sum
equivalent to five percent of the cost of repairs made on the authority and
under the direction of the Inspector shall be deducted from the deposit to
reimburse the Municipality for the time and expense involved. Failure to remove
refuse and surplus materials from streets and from that portion of the land
which is immediately adjacent to a public street, within thirty days after the
substantial completion of work, shall constitute authorization to the Inspector
to have such materials and refuse removed. The cost of such removal shall be
assessed and collected in the manner provided for the making of repairs to
municipal property.
(Ord. 1940-276. Passed 9-9-40.)
   1307.12 APPROVAL OF WATER OR SEWER CONNECTIONS; UNDERGROUND WATER PIPES.
   All water line connections and sanitary sewer connections shall be inspected
and approved by the Chief Administrative Officer or his duly designated
representative.
   Underground water pipes between the curb connection and the meter shall be
"Type K-Copper" only.
(Ord. 1957-420. Passed 12-28-57.)
   1307.13 DRIVEWAY PERMITS.
   Driveways shall be constructed in the manner specified by the Building
Inspector. The elevations and grades of that portion of the driveway within the
normal sidewalk limits must be such as to conform with the grade of the
sidewalks which it adjoins and must provide a uniform grade. Construction
within the limits of the sidewalk must conform to the requirements of Chapter
903 covering the construction of sidewalks. The entire construction must be
such as not to provide a public hazard.

utilized by any person who intends to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals any
order, requirement, determination or other action regarding the Building Code

      (2)   Whenever the appeal relates to seeking a variance from required
construction materials or methods, the standard of review shall be as follows:

unnecessary hardship.

decision or interpretation of an official of the Village regarding the Building
Code, alleging error by such official, the Board of Zoning Appeals may affirm,
modify and affirm, or reverse such decision in the event that it determines the
decision was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or unsupported by the
preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole
record.
   (e)   Advice of Expert on Economic Feasibility. If, in reviewing a request
for a variance, or an appeal alleging error by an official of the Village,
relating to the Building Code, the Administrator or Chairman of the Board of
Zoning Appeals determines that the advice of an expert in applying building
codes or construction of buildings and structures is necessary to assist in the
analysis of determining whether or not the variance request or any appeal
alleging error is appropriate and if in applying the standard of review
confirms that relief is appropriate, the Administrator shall engage an expert
at the applicant's expense, to provide such advice. The Administrator may
require the applicant to deposit a sum estimated to cover the cost to have the
expert provide such advice and attend any hearing or meeting.

   1321.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
definitions:
   (a)   “State Code” shall mean the Residential Code of Ohio, adopted by rule
at Ohio Administrative Code 4101:8 by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, or
current equivalent if the title or rules are renamed or renumbered.
   (b)   “Village Code” shall mean the “Village of Chagrin Falls Residential
Code for
      One-, Two- and Three-Family Dwellings”, a chapter of the Codified
Ordinances of the Village of Chagrin Falls (the “Village”) which is enacted to
govern construction of residential buildings within the Village. The Village
Building Department will not be required to be certified by the Ohio Board of
Building Standards in order to enforce the Village Code, and the State Code
will, unless the Village Building Department becomes certified, not be
applicable within the Municipal Corporation limits of the Village by operation
of Ohio R.C. 3781.10(A)(2).
      (Ord. 2006-57. Passed 9-25-06; Ord. 2021-07. Passed 1-25-21.)
   1321.02  INTENT.
   It is the intent of the Village Council, as the legal authority which best
knows the conditions of and affecting residential buildings within Village, to
fully exercise all of its constitutionally granted powers of local self
government and such police powers as do not conflict with general laws of the
State of Ohio, for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Village. Accordingly, the Village is adopting the Village
Code, which shall be substantially identical to the State Code, but which will
be enforced under the Village’s police powers granted by Article XVIII, Section
3 of the Ohio Constitution. Other provisions of the Village Codified Ordinances
shall continue in full force and effect, so long as they do not conflict with
any general law of the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 2006-57. Passed 9-25-06.)
   1321.03 ADOPTION OF THE VILLAGE CODE.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by the Council of the
Village of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and incorporated by reference for the purpose
of regulating the construction, alteration, addition, repair, removal,
demolition, use, location, occupancy and maintenance of one, two- and three-
family dwellings in the Village, the substance of that certain code known as
the Residential Code of Ohio for One-, Two- and Three-family Dwellings, adopted
by rule at Ohio Administrative Code 4101:8, or its current equivalent, as
adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, which shall serve as the model
code being particularly adopted and incorporated as if fully set forth herein;
for purposes of plan review and enforcement it shall be considered as and
referred to as the “Residential Code of the Village of Chagrin Falls for One-,
Two- and Three- family Dwellings” (or “Village Code”). The Village
Administrator shall maintain a current copy of the State Code (as adopted under
law), for purposes of reference in determining the current law of the Village,
but no municipal official shall enforce the State Code.
(Ord. 2006-57. Passed 9-25-06.)
   1321.04 INTERPRETATION.
   The Village Code is intended to incorporate, substantially, the substantive
provisions of the current State Code. In the event other chapters of the
Village Building or Fire Codes have requirements which are not required by the
State of Ohio, such requirements are mandatory unless they conflict with a
general law of the State of Ohio. In the event of a conflict, the general law
of the State of Ohio shall prevail.
(Ord. 2006-57. Passed 9-25-06.)
   1321.05  ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL.
   No person shall be authorized to interpret or enforce the Village Code
unless that person holds current certification as either an International Code
Council (I.C.C.) Residential Building Inspector, or certified as a Residential
Building Inspector by the Ohio Board of Building Standards. Any person
appointed to the Building Department without either of these certifications is
required to obtain a minimum of one (1) year of experience working under the
supervision of the Village Building Inspector, or Building Inspector contractor
who contracts to perform such services, and such appointee must then obtain a
minimum of the I.C.C. Residential Building Inspector certification within one
(1) year from the date of appointment, before they can be a Building Inspector,
and until then shall hold the position of trainee. Persons who have been
certified to enforce the State Code may enforce the Village Code, but such
personnel are not required to be certified by the State as Residential Building
Inspectors by the Ohio Board of Building Standards. All personnel employed to
interpret and enforce the Village Code shall obtain such additional and
continuing training as the Mayor or the Chief Administrative Officer deems
reasonable and necessary, and which is funded by an appropriation by the
Village Council.

   No permit may be issued to operate a sealed device.
   (b)   Violation of Chapter. Whenever any device is found to be operated in
violation of this chapter or installed in such a manner that it cannot be
operated in conformity with this chapter, the Environmental Control Officer
shall issue written notice to the owner or operator of such device outlining
the violations involved. The Environmental Control Officer shall stipulate a
specific time limitation for corrective measures to be instituted. Failure to
act upon this notice within the time limit granted shall be cause for the
Environmental Control Officer to seal such device and order operation to be
discontinued immediately.

sealed device or for anyone other than the Environmental Control Officer, or an
authorized member of the Environmental Control Board, to remove such seal.

cause to believe that an emission from fuel-burning equipment (or any other
device) violates Section
1331.05 he shall notify the owner of the equipment and set a time for a
hearing, which hearing shall be set not less than ten nor more than twenty days
from the time of notification.

operating within the limits of this chapter, all costs shall be borne by the
Municipality and the owner, shall not be required to have further tests run for
a period of eighteen months provided no material changes in equipment or
processing have been effected. If the test results indicate a violation, all
costs shall be borne by the owner. This shall be cause for the device to be
sealed by the Environmental Control Officer. Such seal shall remain in effect
until the owner produces satisfactory evidence that the necessary corrective
measures have been taken.

   (a)   A description of the building proposed to be moved, giving street
number, construction materials, exterior dimensions and heights, number of
rooms and condition of exterior and interior and sufficient structural
information so that the C.A.O. may determine that the building, when moved,

structural engineer certifying that the building is structurally sound.
   (b)    A description of the lot from which the building is to be moved, if
located in the Municipality, and a description of the lot to which it is
proposed to be moved, if located within the Municipality. Written approvals of
all owners within the Municipality shall also be required.
   (c)   A site and grade plan showing the proposed location of the building
when moved, if the building is to be moved to a lot within the corporate limits
of the Municipality. The grade plan shall be approved by the Village Engineer,
the same as new construction.
   (d)   The highways, streets and alleys over, along or across which the
building is proposed to be moved.
   (e)   The proposed moving date and hours, including the length of time
estimated in the moving.
   (f)   Photographs of all the elevations of the building.
   (g)   A traffic and utilities control plan, indicating number of personnel,
police or utility technicians required and arranged for.
   (h)   Any additional information which the C.A.O. finds necessary for a
thorough inspection of the building and a fair determination of whether a
permit should be issued.
      (Ord. 1988-26. Passed 4-11-88; Ord. 2005-28. Passed 6-13-05.)
   1337.03 PERMIT TO BE IN TWO PARTS.

and build a new foundation to receive the building or structure which is to be
moved, if within the Municipality.

building or structure only after the excavation and foundation have been

approved by the C.A.O.
(Ord. 1988-26. Passed 4-11-88.)
   1337.04 EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL.

   1337.05 CASH BOND; INSURANCE.
   The following papers shall accompany the application for a permit under this
chapter:
   (a)    A cash bond in the minimum amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000)
or such larger amount as the C.A.O. may require as in his judgment being
necessary for the protection of public and private property shall be deposited
with the C.A.O.
The deposit shall be refunded to the person making the deposit upon proof of
his compliance with all of the ordinances of the Municipality and other laws
applicable to the performance of such work and further, that he has compensated
the Municipality and any other person entitled to such payment for all property
damage caused by the person making the deposit in the performance of the work,
and this applies to any public damage to public roads. Otherwise, the
Municipality may deduct from the amount of the cash deposit the reasonable
cost, as determined by the C.A.O., of repairing such damage and shall return to
the permit holder any unexpended balance. If the cost of repairing the roads or
property is in excess of the amount of the cash deposit, the permit holder
performing the work shall nevertheless remain liable to the Municipality or the
property owner, as the case may be, for any excess damage.
   (b)    The permit holder shall carry liability insurance, protecting the
Municipality against liability in the minimum amount of one million dollars
($1,000,000) as to all persons by reason of personal injuries and death, and in

property caused by the work authorized by the permit. The applicant shall
deposit the policy or proof thereof with the C.A.O., and it shall name the
Municipality as an additional insured.

statement or bill of sale signed by the owner or other sufficient evidence that
he is entitled to remove the building.
   (d)    Where utility companies supplying service to the Municipality will be
affected, the applicant shall file with his application suitable letters of
clearance of the utility companies consenting to the removal. It is deemed that
the utilities will be affected except when the removal is limited to a
relocation on the same or an abutting lot and no portion of any Municipal
street will be entered upon.

the applicant's equipment meet the standards provided in this chapter, he shall
refer the matter to the Architectural Review Board for its review as to design
and historical impact, and the permit shall not be issued without the approval

standing on the improved or unimproved portion of any street overnight for more

shall not be granted except in the case of extreme urgency. If the moving is to

given not less than twenty-four hours' notice in writing of such intention at
their last known place of residence by the permit holder, advising them of the

   1350.01  INTENT.
   In addition to the provisions of the intent stated in Section
1105.03, it is the intent of these regulations to ensure the following health,
safety and aesthetic objectives:
   (a)    To limit interference with natural sunlight and the circulation of
air and to preserve space for trees and other plants;
   (b)    To minimize the potential of dish antennas to block views, impair
security, hinder utility or emergency access, pose safety hazards, particularly
in high wind conditions, and accumulate weeds and debris underneath;
    (c)    To reduce visual impact of dish antennas on the distinctive nature
of both old and new homes, and to preserve property values;
    (d)    To preserve the historic character of the Village of Chagrin Falls
as evidenced by the designation of the Village as a historical district, which
designation has been based in large part upon the architectural and other
aesthetic qualities of both residential and commercial districts within the
Village;
    (e)    To preserve pre-historic or historic sites, buildings, structures or
objects included in, or eligible for inclusion on, the National Register of
Historic Places; and
    f)    To establish regulations which are reasonable and necessary to
achieve the stated objectives.

   1353.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities, the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of Chagrin Falls, State of Ohio
does ordain as follows:
   (b)    Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the Village are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)    Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
       (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in special flood hazard areas;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume
responsibility for their actions.
      (8)    Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property
within the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (9)    Protect the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, reduce soil
erosion, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
    (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
       (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

   (n)    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway
boundaries and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (o)    "Flood protection elevation (FPE)" means the base flood elevation
plus eighteen inches (18") of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (p)    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (q)    "Freeboard" means an increment of elevation added to the base flood
elevation to provide a factor of safety for uncertainties in calculations,
future watershed development, encroachment in the floodway fringe, and
unpredictable effects such as those caused by ice or debris jams.

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (s)    "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (t)    "Letter of Map Change" means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMP)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (u)    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements
specified in this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (v)    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (w)    "Manufactured home park" means as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of
land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (x)    "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (y)    "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Chagrin Falls Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 2, 1980, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.

partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's
Department, or any court.
   (aa)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,

standards of this chapter.
   (c)    Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator. The Chief
Administrative Officer is hereby appointed to enforce the provisions of these
regulations, and, administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying
development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.
   (d)    Administrator's Duties. Duties and responsibilities of the Chief
Administrative Officer shall include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Determination of hydraulically connected areas.
         A.    The Administrator shall interpret floodplain boundaries and
provide flood hazard and flood protection elevation information.
         B.    If the Administrator determines that a proposed development is
near the special flood hazard area, sufficient hydraulic analysis must be
provided so that the Administrator can determine if the area is hydraulically
connected to the source of flooding in the floodplain.
         C.    If an area is determined to be hydraulically connected to the
special flood hazard area, sufficient data must be submitted to the
Administrator to determine if the property and/or its associated sewers,
drains, and lowest floors are at or below the flood protection elevation.
         D.    If the Administrator determines the area to be hydraulically
connected, and the lowest floor is below the flood protection elevation, the
area is subject to all provisions stated in this chapter.
      (2)    Permit review.
         A.    Review all development permit applications to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.    Review all development permit applications to assure that all
necessary permits have been received from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required.
         C.    Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1353.07(a) is met.
         D.    Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.

the source of such data, the following provisions apply:
         A.    Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor.
         B.    For all new or substantially improved floodproofed
nonresidential structures:
            1.    Verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean
sea level, to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection
1353.06(b)(2) hereof.
         C.   Make and permanently keep for public inspection all records
necessary for the administration of these regulations including Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Letters of Map Amendment and Revision, records of issuance and
denial of permits to develop in special flood hazard areas, determinations of
whether development is in or out of special flood hazard areas for the purpose
of issuing floodplain development permits, elevation certificates, variances,
and records of enforcement actions taken for violations of these regulations.
      (5)    Alteration of watercourses.
         A.    Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the State Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
         B.    Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant for the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the
flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished.
         C.    Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1353.04(a)(4) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (6)    Interpretation and appeals.
         A.    Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.
Where a map boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the
Flood Elevation Profile for the Village shall prevail. The person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided in Section
1353.05.
         B.    Provide information, testimony or other evidence as needed
during variance hearings.
      (7)    Alteration of Village boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the Village of Chagrin Falls have been
modified by annexation or the Village has assumed authority over an area, or no
longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for
a particular area. In order that the Village of Chagrin Falls Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represents the Village of Chagrin Falls boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of the Village of Chagrin Falls
suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating showing the new corporate limits

public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, or conflict with
subsection (a)(6) hereof, or existing local laws or ordinances; and,
          B.    The structure or other development is protected by methods to
minimize flood damages.
      (6)    In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
         A.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
          C.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the Village;
         E.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and

1111.06 of the Zoning Code, the Chief Administrative Officer shall maintain the
records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   (b)    Conditions for Variances.
      (1)    Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
unnecessary hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute an unnecessary hardship.
      (2)    Additionally, variances for new construction and substantial
improvements to existing structures in the floodplain shall be granted only
after the Board considers and makes findings of fact as required in paragraph
(a) (6).
      (3)   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, variances may
be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      (4)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (5)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall, if applicable,
be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (c)    Lapse of Variances. A variance, once granted, shall expire in one
year subject to the requirements of Section
1111.10 of the Zoning Code.
   (d)    Action by Council. Following a decision by the Board, each case shall
be referred to Council. After reviewing the Board's decision, Council may
confirm, amend, or reverse, the decision by a majority vote of its membership.
Immediately following Council's decision, a record of such decision, including
notice of the expiration date of an approved variance, shall be mailed to the
applicant.

   1353.07 FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1353.03(b) identifies a segment within special flood hazard areas known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1353.04 (d)(3). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
    (a)    Prohibit encroachments, new construction, substantial improvements
and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
   (b)    If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1353.06 and this section.
   (c)    Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the
Chief Administrative Officer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 2005-22. Passed 4-11-05.)
   1353.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF BUFFER AREA.
    (a)    Purpose. The buffer area is hereby established to limit impact of
land uses on rivers in order to preserve and conserve the quality, purity,
clarity and free-flowing condition of streams, maintain natural water
temperatures, preserve aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal habitat,
prevent erosion of stream banks, lessen the level of siltation of stream waters
and preserve valuable water resources in the interest of present and future
generations.
   (b)    Boundary. The buffer area shall be maintained along both sides of
stream channels which have a mean surface width at normal low water of at least
ten feet or greater and wet lands as defined by the Army Corps of Engineers and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). The minimum
boundary of the buffer area shall be set at 120 feet in a horizontal plane
outward from the normal low water mark of the stream channel. It shall be
preserved in its natural state and shall be adjusted outward to include
sensitive areas such as steep slopes, wetlands and wooded areas adjacent to the
stream.
   (c)    Permitted Uses. Use or activities shall not significantly affect the
natural quality of the area and are limited to the following:
      (1)    Passive recreational uses such as hiking, fishing, etc.
      (2)    Only damaged or diseased trees or those that the Administrator has
determined to be in imminent danger of being uprooted or falling in or along
the stream may be removed. The stump and root structure of trees on the stream
bank shall be left in place to retard bank erosion.
   (d)    The buffer area described above shall be overlays to the existing
underlying districts as shown on the official Zoning Map of the Village, and as
such, the provisions for the flood plain buffer areas shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions.
   (e)    Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any buffer area and those of any underlying district, the more
restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the flood plain buffer areas
shall apply.
   (f)    In the event any provision concerning a flood plain buffer area is
declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions,
or judicial discretion, the basic underlying district provision shall remain
applicable.
   1353.09 FEMA LETTERS FOR MAP REVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS.
   Any individual, firm, or other non-community official, submitting a revision
request to FEMA, should consult with the Chief Administrative Officer. FEMA
letters of map revisions require submission of the Overview and Concurrence
form 3067-0148 which involves Village approval of the application for both
CLOMR and LOMR requests. According to CFR Title 44, Chapter 1, section 65.4,
applications including the submission of new technical data should come from
the CEO of the community. Otherwise, the application may be submitted by the
property owner with the required signatures of the requester, community
official, and engineer.

   1353.99  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree. Whoever
violates any provision of this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements, including violations of conditions of and safeguards established
in connection with conditions shall be fined or imprisoned as provided by the
laws of the Village. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.

            (Ord. 2016-80. Passed 12-12-16.)
   1355.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
measures that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such may include preserving riparian areas, preserving existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, minimizing
disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas or other
protective clearing or grubbing . Soil compaction shall be minimized and,
unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and maintain a 50-foot
buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface waters of the state, or
riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever is greater, unless
maintaining this buffer is infeasible, e.g. stream crossings for roads or
utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation and restoration. Direct
stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal and maximize
stormwater infiltration. [Communities with riparian and/or wetland setbacks
include the following language: If the riparian setback is greater than 50
feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall occur within the riparian or
wetland setback unless a variance of the riparian or wetland setback regulation
has been granted.]
   (b)   Erosion Control: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls that are
capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil exposed
during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of control
designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or construction shall be
included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide specifications for stabilization of
all disturbed areas of the site and provide guidance as to which method of
stabilization will be employed for any time of the year. Such may include:
temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, matting, sod stabilization,
vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction operations, the use of
construction entrances, and the use of alternative ground cover. Erosion
control must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that control the
volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent erosion.
Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to minimize
erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such may
include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct flow away from
exposed soils and protective grading. These shall divert runoff away from
disturbed areas and steep slopes where practicable. Velocity dissipation
devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any
outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to a
water course so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and
functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen (14) days. Such
practices may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences,
storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which
direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address factors such as the
amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of
resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be
considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not
considered a sediment unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village of Chagrin Falls
Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD, is required for any one of the following
conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the Village of Chagrin
Falls.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village of Chagrin
Falls.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with Revised Universal Soil Loss
Equation (RUSLE) or other generally accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width ? 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of ? 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations has
been reduced by 40 percent. This limit is typically reached when sediment
occupies one-half of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds,
the applicant must consider public safety, especially as it relates to
children, as a design factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment
controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The
use of a combination of sediment and erosion control measures in order to
achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village of Chagrin Falls, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion shall be used to keep runoff away from
disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales, dikes or
berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control, such as boxed
inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water entering
active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of
one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay bales and
filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and that dust is
controlled. These best management must include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be
cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, Village of Chagrin Falls Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga
SWCD may require additional best management to control off site tracking and
dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section 1355.09 (g)
of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village of Chagrin Falls Engineer
and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water
trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of
disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (3)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in Section
1355.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the applicant is
permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
         I.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measures before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (4)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including building
materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The applicant must
implement site best management to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials,
or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or the MS4. These shall
include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
         B.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
         C.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
         D.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall
be stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The ESC Plan shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
         E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
         F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
            i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated
runoff and prevent discharge.
            ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer
with the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
            iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or
other such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with
contaminated materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the Village of Chagrin Falls Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD and all of
the following conditions are met:
         A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         C.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
For sites where final sediment controls will not be completed by October 1, a
Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting may be required at the discretion of the
Village Engineer, with the landowner and the developer, engineer and contractor
of the project and the Village Engineer prior to October 1, in order to plan
and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in the most current
online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the controls are functional and to evaluate whether
the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are required.
Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in
the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls. Certified
inspection reports shall be submitted to the Village Engineer within seven (7)
working days from the inspection and retained at the development site.
        These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Chagrin Falls or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village of Chagrin Falls Engineer. The
inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control must be maintained in a functional condition until all up
slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall provide
a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control and shall ensure a responsible party and adequate
funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village of
Chagrin Falls Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate is required, the SWP3
must be amended and the new BMP must be installed within ten (10) days of
notice from the Village Engineer.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the must be implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the
inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned is not needed,
the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the is not needed.
   (j)    Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village of Chagrin Falls Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization
also requires the installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater
control measures (SCMs).

   1357.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE .
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Chagrin Falls:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Chagrin Falls to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
SCMs are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Chagrin
Falls' future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1357.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Chagrin Falls shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter 1357
Comprehensive Stormwater Management.

predevelopment levels.
         (E)   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village of Chagrin Falls and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1161, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1357.07 of this Chapter, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1355 of the Building Code and Chapter
1151 of the Planning and Zoning Code, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section
1357.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village Engineer
as detailed in Section
1357.08 of this Chapter.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Chagrin
Falls, SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot
held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the
property owners, by the Village of Chagrin Falls. SCMs serving single lots
shall be placed on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by
the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded should be restored
to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable.
Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should
be amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18
inches, 2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with
stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Water Protection: The Village Engineer may allow modification to
streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1357.07  of this Chapter, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1355  of the Building Code and Chapter
1151  of the Planning and Zoning Code, all as determined by the Village
Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project
will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form,
and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site Stormwater Discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet Flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open Channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open Drainage Systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village of Chagrin Falls zoning or where the use of an open
drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
Village Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary:
         (A)   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         (B)   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         (C)   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         (D)   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         (E)   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Chagrin Falls:
         (A)   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         (B)   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         (C)   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-
five (25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         (D)   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         (E)   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         (F)   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         (G)   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         (H)   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         (I)   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile
through a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100 year, 24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland Flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory Flood Storage Mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of Chagrin
Falls must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village of Chagrin Falls,
reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal
boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage
areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed
area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:  
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         (A)   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         (B)   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
stormwater into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering
report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section 1357.09(c)(6) of
this Chapter.
         (C)   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the applicant demonstrates to the [community engineer's] satisfaction that
these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1357.09(c)(6) of this Chapter, and has prior written approval from the Ohio
EPA.
         (D)   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         (A)   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            (1)   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            (2)   Using the following equation:
         WQV = C*P*A/12
      where terms have the following meanings:
         WQV   = water quality volume in acre-feet
         C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
         P   = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
         A   = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient:
         C= 0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
         i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         (B)   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         (C)   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         (D)   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         (E)   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         (F)   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in
a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to
the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         (A)   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         (B)   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         (C)   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         (A)   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         (B)   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited. An invasive species is a species that is both non-
native (or alien) to the ecosystem under consideration and whose introduction
causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm, or harm to human
health
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         (A)   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         (B)   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
         (C)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the
following requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in
the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
       (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         a.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage
and incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall
be treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from NEH-4 (Spell this out).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the Village Engineer.
         b.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section 1357.09(d)(3) of this Chapter, determine the
percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage,
select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm

For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
   (E)    Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.

redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section 1357.10 of this Chapter may be approved by the Village
Engineer.
(Ord. 2016-79. Passed 12-12-16.)
   1357.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.

compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the

access to a facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit
discharge inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)    If the Village of Chagrin Falls is refused access to any part of
the facility from which storm water is discharged, and the Village demonstrates
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
the Village may seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but
not limited to injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of
appropriate jurisdiction.
