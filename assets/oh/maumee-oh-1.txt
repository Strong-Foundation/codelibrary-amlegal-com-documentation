to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Maumee, Ohio
that:
   SECTION 1. The ordinances of the City of Maumee, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections be, and they hereby are,
approved, adopted, and enacted as the 1989 Codified Ordinances of the City of
Maumee, Ohio, which may be cited as the "Maumee Revised Code".
   SECTION 2. The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
1989 Codified Ordinances of the City of Maumee, Ohio shall be in full force and
effect as provided in Section 7 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and

except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the 1989 Codified Ordinances of the City of Maumee,
Ohio, shall not be construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred
under any legislative provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment,
or an action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

ensure that the summary is legally accurate and sufficient.

daily operation, and to avoid legal entanglements including conflict with
general state law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
 
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

and other matters pertaining to finance, taxation, or debt), the state statutes
or other laws shall not be applicable. Rather, it is the people's intention
that the Council, or an appropriately authorized board, commission, or officer,
may provide for the procedure and manner of exercise of any power granted to
municipal corporations by the adoption of an ordinance or resolution, or in the
case of boards, commissions, and administrative officers, by the adoption of
administrative regulations. State laws shall be applicable to supplement this
Charter only where this Charter or the municipality's ordinances or resolutions
or, in the case of boards, commissions, and administrative officers, by the
adoption of administrative regulations make them applicable, or where it is
necessary to apply the state laws in order to uphold or validate this Charter,
the ordinances, resolutions, or administrative regulations of the Municipality,
or the actions of the officers or employees of the Municipality.

SECTION 5 MEETINGS.
   (a)   The Council may adopt rules, regulations, or by-laws for the conduct
of its business and shall hold regular meetings at least twice in each calendar
month with the exception of the months of June, July, and August, during each
of which months Council may, at its discretion, dispense with one of its

necessary, which may be called by the Clerk upon the written request of the

vote or request for the calling of a special meeting shall state the subject or

by personal service or by delivery thereof at their usual places of residence,
but members of Council may waive such notice by their attendance at such

Whole, shall be held in the Council Chambers of the Municipality, except that
an alternative location shall be designated by the Clerk upon the request of
the Mayor or any three (3) members of Council when:
      (1)   There is reason to believe that the seating available in Council
Chambers will not be adequate to accommodate the members of the public who are
expected to attend the meeting;

or usage for another governmental purpose;
      (3)   When Council wishes to hold a joint meeting with another
governmental unit;
      (4)   When Council is engaged in fact finding related to a specific site
or location; or
      (5)   When approved during the course of the previous regular or special
meeting of Council by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members elected to
Council.
   Designation of an alternative location for a Council or Committee of the
Whole meeting shall be made no later than the preceding regular meeting of
Council and notice of such alternative location shall be posted in the same
manner as legislation of the Municipality.
   (c)   Council, Committee of the Whole, all Council committees, and all
boards, commissions, and committees established under this Charter or by
ordinance or resolution of Council are public bodies of the Municipality. All
meetings of every public body of the Municipality shall be public meetings open
to the public at all times except as provided below. No ordinance, resolution,
or motion shall be approved except at such public meeting; provided, however,
that the public body may hold an executive session if a majority of a quorum so
determines by a roll call vote to hold such a session at a regular or special
meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration of the following matters:
      (1)   The appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline, promotion
demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
his official duties or for his removal from office. If a public body holds an
executive session pursuant to this subsection, the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved purposes listed
in this subsection are the purposes for which the executive session is to be
held, but need not include the name of any person to be considered at the
meeting;
      (2)   The purchase, lease, or sale of property if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose private interests are adverse to those of the Municipality;

give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose private
interests are adverse to those of the Municipality;
      (4)   Conference with an attorney for the public body concerning pending
or imminent court action involving the public body;
      (5)   Preparation for, conduct, or review of negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees;

state statutes; or
      (7)   Security arrangements where disclosure of matters discussed might
reveal information that could be used to commit or avoid prosecution for a
violation of the law.
   Any ordinance, resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind is invalid
unless adopted in an open meeting of the public body.
   Any ordinance, resolution, or formal action of any kind adopted in an open
meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is
invalid unless the deliberations were conducted in an executive session held in
accordance with the provisions of this Charter. However, a violation of this
section does not prevent the public body from subsequently taking formal action
on the same subject matter after the public body has deliberated on the subject
matter in an open public meeting.
   The Council may invite any person into an executive session to provide
advice or information to the Council concerning the subject matter of the
executive session, provided such person is acting in an advisory capacity to
Council and is not acting as a representative of an adverse party.
   (d)   Council shall provide by ordinance for the implementation of this
section, for public notice of meetings of boards, commissions, committees, and
agencies, and for public inspection of minutes and records required by law to

Council. At any meeting at which a quorum is present, any ordinance or
resolution may be passed or adopted or any other action may be taken by the
affirmative votes of a majority of the members of the Council present and
eligible to vote at such meeting, unless a larger number be required by the

   The Article and Section headings herein have been inserted for convenience
for purposes of reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of,
or otherwise affect, any provision of this Charter.
   In order that a ready means may be at hand for reconciling any conflicts,
resolving any inconsistencies and clarifying any obscurities which may be
discovered in the language of this Charter, the power is hereby vested in

with the spirit thereof by ordinance, resolution or other measure of said
Council adopted by the affirmative vote of five (5) or more of its members.

the laws of Ohio pertaining to municipalities and dealing with the same subject
matter shall apply.
SECTION 8 SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL OF MEMBER OF BOARD OR COMMISSION.
   Upon complaint of the Mayor or of a majority of the members of a board or
commission of the Municipality, the Council shall determine whether cause

member of a board or commission may be suspended for a period of not more than
sixty days or may be removed from office by a vote of a majority of the members

of the Municipality any conflict of interest that he or she may have pertaining
to any legislation pending before Council prior to its reading. Such a conflict
of interest shall deprive the elected official of any right to participate in

official to make such disclosure shall not affect the validity of the action of
Council upon such legislation. However, if an elected official has failed to
disclose a conflict of interest pertaining to legislation which has been
formally acted upon by Council and the vote of such elected official was
determinative of the success or failure of the legislation, then the
legislation may be voided by subsequent action of Council, upon disclosure or
discovery of the conflict of interest of the elected official.

on the last day of that month.
      (3)   A.    The time within which an act is required by law to be done
shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except
that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be
done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
                  B.    When a public office, in which an act required by law
is to be performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes

(Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
            (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior
action taken thereunder;
            (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
            (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or
punishment incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
            (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of
any such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment;
and the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   
   (d)    If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
      (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to
all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
   
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
   
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
      References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption, and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
   (c)   (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
            (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the
United States is intended;
            (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
           (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
            (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
        
      (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
            (1)    The object sought to be attained;
            (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
            (3)    The legislative history;
            (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including
laws upon the same or similar subjects;
            (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
            (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.09  MILITARY RESERVISTS.
      (a)    Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3923.381, any permanent employee in the

armed services of the United States or of any state, shall be entitled to elect
to participate in the City's health insurance program upon the same terms and
to the same extent as though such employee had not been called to active duty.
   (b)    Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3923.381(D)(5)(b), the City shall continue to
pay that portion of the reservist's contribution that it would have paid had
the employee not been called to active duty and had continued in the service of
the City.
   
   (c)   Any election for continuation coverage shall be in accordance with the
terms, provisions, and procedures set forth in Ohio R.C. 3923.381 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
(Ord. 024-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
      Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be guilty of a

   (a)   The contractor or vendor shall not discriminate against any employee

resulting contract shall require a bid bond, performance bond and payment bond.
Neither a performance bond nor a payment bond shall be required for

professional services, or construction shall not include any of the following:
      (1)    A provision that requires the City to indemnify or hold harmless
another person;
      (2)    A provision that requires the City to agree to limit the liability
for any direct loss to the City for bodily injury, death, or damage to property
of the City caused by the negligence, intentional or willful misconduct,
fraudulent act, recklessness, or other tortious conduct of a person or a
person's employees or agents, or a provision that would otherwise impose an
indemnification obligation on the City;
      (3)    A provision that requires the City to be bound by a term or
condition that is unknown to the City at the time of signing a contract or that
may be unilaterally changed by the other party;

the City for the transaction without authorization by City Council.
         B.   If a contract contains a term or condition described in this

can be considered enforceable as if it did not contain such term or condition
if the City elects not to consider the contract void.
         C.   A contract that contains a term or condition described in this
section shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio law
notwithstanding any term or condition to the contrary in the contract.
         D.   This section does not apply to a contract awarded (1) as a sole
source (2) as an emergency purchase.
   
   (f)   Any other term or condition that the City deems appropriate for the
contract.
(Ord. 026-2023. Passed 8-21-23.)

filed with the Civil Division of the Maumee Municipal Court, pay any applicable
filing fee as set forth by the Maumee Municipal Court and sent to the office of
administrative hearings by certified mail within 10 days of the date of the
mailing of the decision by the hearing examiner. The City officer or employee
who issued the notice of violation which gave rise to the request for review or
a supervisor to the issuing officer may file a written response to the request
for review. The response must be filed within 15 days of the receipt of the
request for review by the officer of administrative hearings. The Maumee
Municipal Court may set aside the decision of the hearing on finding from

Court may reduce a civil fine on a showing that the civil fine would cause an
undue hardship and that the underlying infraction has been cured or is unlikely
to reoccur. The Maumee Municipal Court may investigate a claim that an
infraction has been cured, make findings with respect to the claim of cure, and
include those findings within the record. The decision of the Maumee Municipal
Court may be appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals in the same manner
in form as any civil action filed with the municipal court.

the title of the Ordinance or Resolution on printed form on the agenda is
considered a reading. The first and second readings may be part of the consent
agenda. The vote on such suspension of three readings shall be taken by yeas

such vote in the minutes together with the names of members voting yea and nay.

provided, however, that if two or more members of Council are not eligible to
vote on the subject matter of an ordinance or resolution, the emergency measure
shall require the affirmative vote of at least four (4) members of Council.
   42.    Definitions.  As used in these Rules the following definitions shall
apply:
      A.    "Attendance," means being present in person or by electronic means
including but not limited to phone, zoom, video conferencing or other similar
means.
      B.    "Majority." Whenever "majority" is used herein, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, it shall be held to mean a majority of those members duly
elected or appointed to Council.

members shall be called, and each member shall orally state their vote after
their name is called.
      D.    "Written notice" For purposes of these rules, a writing, text,
email, or other electronic notice shall be considered a written notice.
   43.    Amending Rules.  A majority vote is required to alter, amend,
rescind, or supplement these rules. Any proposed alterations, or amendments or
supplements shall be submitted in writing at a regular meeting and placed on
the calendar for the next regular meeting under the order of new business,
unless by unanimous recorded vote of all members elected to Council, such
proposed alterations, amendments, or supplements may only be adopted at the
meeting at which the same are submitted.
   44.    Quorum. A majority of all members elected or appointed to Council
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting, but a
smaller number may adjourn the meeting from time to time and may compel the
attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may be
prescribed by the rules of Council. At any meeting at which a quorum is

if mailed, on the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service or on the
date delivered without mailing to the Maumee Tax Office.
   (g)    Extension of Time for Filing Returns.
      (1)    Taxpayers granted extensions of time for filing their federal
income tax returns may have an extension for filing their Maumee Tax Return
provided that a copy of the federal extension is filed with the Commissioner on
or before the original due date of the Maumee Tax Return.
      (2)    The extended date for filing the Maumee return shall be the last
day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended. Statutory interest will be charged from
the original due date of the return until date of actual payment.
      (3)    If a taxpayer wishes to extend the time for filing the Maumee tax
return to a date other than that provided by the automatic federal extension,
the taxpayer must file such a request in writing to the Commissioner prior to
the due date of the automatic extension. The extension may be granted by the
Commissioner upon terms and conditions set forth by him or her.
      (4)    A taxpayer's extension request may be denied if the taxpayer is
delinquent in the filing of any tax returns or payments of taxes, penalties, or
interest due.
      (5)    The granting of an extension does not extend the time for paying a
tax, it only extends the time for filing the return.
   (h)    The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing
such forms or from paying the tax due.
   (i)    Payments received for taxes due shall be allocated first to penalties
due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due.
(Ord. 258-2003. Passed 12-15-03.)
   193.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; TAXES WITHHELD BY EMPLOYER.
   (a)    Each employer within or doing business within Maumee who employs one
or more persons on a qualifying wage, commission or other compensation basis
shall, at the time of payment thereof, deduct the tax of one and one-half
percent (1-1/2%) from the qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation
earned or received by Maumee residents regardless of where such compensation
was earned or received and shall deduct the tax of one and one-half percent (1-
1/2%) from the qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation earned or
received within Maumee by nonresidents.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, where an
employer within or doing business within Maumee employs a Maumee resident in
another taxing municipality requiring such employer to deduct its tax from all
employees engaged therein, such employer shall withhold for and remit to Maumee
only the difference, if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing
municipality and the tax imposed by this chapter; or shall withhold Maumee tax
on 100% of the income subject to Maumee tax if the Maumee resident/employee is
employed at a location where a municipal tax is not imposed.
   (c)   Each such employer shall, on or before the last day of the month
following each calendar quarter, make a return and remit to Maumee the tax
hereby required to be withheld; provided, however, each such employer who
deducts such taxes in the amount of three hundred dollars ($300.00) or more per
month shall remit to Maumee on or before the fifteenth day of the succeeding
month the taxes so deducted monthly. Effective April 1, 2007, every agent
(third party) representing an employer filing monthly or quarterly as
prescribed by the City shall make payment by the electronic funds transfer
(EFT) prescribed by the City, unless exemption from this requirement is given
by the Commissioner of Taxation. Such return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Commissioner of Taxation and shall be
subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Commissioner.
Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (d)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City of Maumee, as a trustee for
the benefit of the City of Maumee and any such tax collected by such employer
from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the City of Maumee, be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (e)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment,
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as
required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any such
employer does not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a prior
failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
   (f)    On or before February 28 following any calendar year, such employer
shall file with the Commissioner an annual reconciliation return along with an
information return for such employee from whom Maumee income tax has been or
should have been withheld, showing the name, address and Social Security number
of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year and the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from the employee with the municipality
for which said tax was withheld identified. The information return shall also
include all of the information required to be reported by the employer to IRS
on a W-2 form. At the time of filing the annual reconciliation return the
employer shall pay over any amounts deducted or which should have been deducted
during the preceding year but which were not remitted. The annual
reconciliation form shall be obtained from the Commissioner.
   (g)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish forms 1099 to IRS for
individuals or businesses to whom or which they have non-employee compensation
shall furnish copies of the said form 1099's to the Commissioner or in lieu
thereof, a list containing the same information as required by IRS on the
1099's on or before the due date for such form 1099 as established by IRS.
Failure to provide the foregoing information may result in any deduction for
payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer’s return to be disallowed.
   (h)   Every employer shall retain all records necessary to compute
withholding taxes due Maumee for a period of five years from the date the
Reconciliation Form, W-2 Forms, and 1099 Forms are filed.
   (i)   The Return is Considered Filed When. All returns and forms required to
be filed by an employer are considered filed on the date postmarked by the
United States Postal Service or on the date delivered without mailing by the
taxpayer to the Maumee Tax Office.
   (j)   The failure of any employer to receive or procure a return, or other
required form shall not excuse the employer from preparing any information
return, withholding tax returns or from filing such forms or from paying the
tax due.
   (k)   Payments received for withholding taxes due shall be applied first to
penalties due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due.
   (l)   Any employer may elect to make payment by electronic fund transfer
upon availability. Payment of taxes by electronic transfer does not affect an
employer’s obligation to file returns as required under this section. The
Commissioner of Taxation may adopt rules governing the format for filing
returns under this section by employers who remit undeposited taxes by
electronic funds transfer. (Ord. 229-2006. Passed 12-4-06.)
   193.07 DECLARATIONS; ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS.
   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject to
Section
193.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise and activity

estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any.
   (a)   (1)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each
year during the life of this chapter, or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month from the date in which the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first
time.
      (2)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of
each fiscal year or period.
      (3)    Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Commissioner of Taxation. Credit may be taken for Maumee
income tax to be withheld, if any, from any portion of such income. In
addition, credit may be taken for tax paid or payable to other taxing
municipalities in accordance with the provisions of Section
193.14.
      (4)    The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
      (5)    The taxpayer making the declaration shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Commissioner at least one-fourth of the estimated
annual tax due after deducting:
         A.   Any portion of such tax to be deducted or withheld at the source
pursuant to Section
193.06;
         B.   Any credits allowable under the provisions of Section
193.14; and;
         C.   Any overpayment of previous year's tax liability which the
taxpayer has not elected to have refunded.
At least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the
sixth, ninth and twelfth months that are for non-individuals, for individuals a
similar amount shall paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth and
thirteenth month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year, provided
that in case an amended declaration has been duly filed, or the taxpayer is
taxable for a portion of the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in
equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due Maumee shall be
paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
193.05.
   (c)    Notwithstanding any provision or requirement of this chapter to the
contrary, if a taxpayer resides or proposes to reside in Maumee or engages in
business or proposes to engage in business therein for a period of less than
three months or if the Commissioner determines that the residence of any
taxpayer in Maumee or the period during which any taxpayer will engage in
business in Maumee may reasonably be expected to be less than three months, the
Commissioner may require any such taxpayer to file a declaration and/or a
return within such time as he may reasonably fix and to pay or secure the
payment of any tax due or to become due and/or any tax withheld or required to
be withheld during the period of residence or engagement in business of the
period of such residence or engagement in business estimated by the
Commissioner.
The date or dates fixed by the Commissioner for the filing of declarations and/
or for payments or security for payments of taxes pursuant to this subsection
shall be in lieu of the dates for such filing or payment specified for
taxpayers generally to this chapter.
      (Ord. 258-2003. Passed 12-15-03.)

(Ord. 258-2003. Passed 12-15-03.)
 
   193.14  RELIEF AND RECIPROCITY PROVISIONS.
   It is the intent of this section that a taxpayer, subject to tax in more
than one municipality on the same income, who has complied with the provisions
hereof shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total municipal income
tax on such income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter:
   (a)    Residents of the City. When a resident of Maumee is subject to and
has paid or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal income tax in another
municipality or state, except the State of Ohio or except a state which has a
reciprocity agreement with the State of Ohio, on the same income taxable under
this chapter and such other municipality or state, except the State of Ohio or
except a state which has a reciprocity agreement with the State of Ohio, does
not allow a credit to its nonresidents, such Maumee resident may claim a credit
of the amount of such tax paid to the other municipality, or state, except the
State of Ohio, or except a state which has a reciprocity agreement with the
State of Ohio, but not in excess of the tax assessed by this chapter.
   (b)    If the tax due such other municipality has been paid to or withheld
in such other municipality, a resident of Maumee may claim credit for and
assign to Maumee any claim for refund to which he may be entitled from such
other municipality. In the event an amount is not received by Maumee equal to
such credit claimed by reason of tax payments made to, or withheld in, such
other municipality then the taxpayer shall be liable to Maumee for an amount by
which the claimed credit exceeds the amount recovered on such assignment by
Maumee, together with penalty and interest. If satisfactory evidence is
offered, however, that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim covered by the
assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit therefor because of
fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
   (c)    Assignment of any claim for refund to which a Maumee resident may be
entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of
that portion of the Maumee income tax represented by such assignment; provided
that an overpayment resulting from the credit allowed by reason of such
assignment shall not be refunded until such assignment has been remitted to
Maumee by such other municipality.
   (d)    The credits provided for shall not be allowed unless the same are
claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to, and filed with the
Commissioner. In the event a taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to file such
timely return or form he shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be
liable for the full amount of tax assessed by this chapter, together with such
interest and penalties, both civil and criminal, as are prescribed in this
chapter.
   (e)    No credit shall be given for any tax paid to a school district.
      (Ord. 258-2003. Passed 12-15-03.)
   193.15 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)    This chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until regulated according to law, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue effective until all of such taxes levied in the aforesaid period are
fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such
taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully
terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Sections
193.11 and
193.99.
   (b)   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Sections
193.05 and
193.06 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 258-2003. Passed 12-15-03.)
   193.16 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
    If any provision, sentence, clause, section, or part of this chapter is
found to be unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionality,
illegality, or invalidity shall affect only that particular sentence, clause,
section, or part of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of
Council that this chapter would have been adopted had such unconstitutional,
illegal, or invalid provision, sentence, clause, section, or part thereof not
been included herein. This tax chapter, all subsequent tax ordinances, and all
preceding tax ordinances, including all amendments thereto, shall continue to
be effective insofar as the collection of taxes levied thereunder until all
said taxes, and all penalties and interest thereon, are fully paid, and any and
all suits and prosecutions for the collection of said taxes, penalties, and
interest, or for the punishment or violation of said ordinances shall have been
fully terminated.

   193.17 REQUIREMENTS FOR JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.

Economic Development Districts if the modifications are passed by Council in an
ordinance which either specifically approves a Joint Economic Development
District contract or specifically amends this chapter. (Ord. 258-2003. Passed
12-15-03.)
 
   193.18  COLLECTION POLICY.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 133-2009, passed November 2, 2009, the

APPENDIX A
Ohio R.C. 718.02 Determination of Income Subject to Tax.
   This section does not apply to electric companies or combined companies, or
to electric light companies for which an election made under Ohio R.C. 5745.031
is in effect.
   (A)    In the taxation of income which is subject to municipal income taxes,
if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both
within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation shall disclose
with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that
part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
municipal corporation, then only such portion shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in such municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income
taxation. In the absence of such records, net profit from a business or
profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a municipal
corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal
corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as
the average ratio of:
      (1)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average net book value
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;

Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on

by the electronic funds transfer (EFT) prescribed by the City, unless exemption
from this requirement is given by the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 230-2016. Passed 12-19-16.)
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
194.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty (20) days.

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
194.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
194.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
194.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve (12) or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes
a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on
those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for
tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve (12), the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve (12) days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, a
casino operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is

calendar year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously

monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.

tax deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth (10th) day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld
and that was not previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security
number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, a
video lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
194.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   194.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
194.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
194.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
194.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
194.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
194.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
194.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
194.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
194.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
        (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   “Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Subsection (A)(2) of this Section
194.062 on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(l)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(l)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For the tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer
may elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its
net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this
election, the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such
apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return, or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(l) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (1)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(l)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(l)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(l)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (1)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Subsection (A)(2) of this Section
194.062.
         (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15; Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18; Ord.

   194.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 194.80 of
this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section 194.80 of this Chapter is
terminated, a valid election made under section 194.86 of this Chapter is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
         (Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
194.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
194.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
194.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   194.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen (15)
years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the
Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.

credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it
shall be measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the Municipality
derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen (15) years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)

         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve (12) months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
194.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth
month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year;

the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
            (Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
194.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section 194.10 of
this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22-1/2%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67-1/2%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the municipal corporation under Section
194.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   194.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Every individual who resides in the City of Maumee who receives net
profits, qualifying wages, commissions or other taxable income for work done or
services performed or rendered outside the City of Maumee, and who is liable
and has paid to another municipality an income tax on the same income taxable
and taxed under this chapter, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other
municipality, but not in excess of the tax assessed by this chapter on such
income. The tax credit allowed on employee compensation must be figured
separately on each source of income after it is reduced by the applicable Form
2106 expenses. The tax credit allowed is obtained by multiplying the lower of
the tax rate of such other municipality, or of this municipality, by the
taxable income earned in or attributable to the municipality of employment or
business activity. Income taxed by another municipality that is offset by a
loss is not eligible for credit and no loss is permitted to offset qualifying
wages per section
194.03(1)(H)(ii) of this Chapter. The total tax credit allowed cannot exceed
the Maumee tax liability.
   (B)   If the tax due such other municipality has been paid to or withheld in
such other municipality, a resident of Maumee may claim credit for and assign
to Maumee any claim for refund to which he may be entitled from such other
municipality providing it is made within the time which a claim for refund may
be made as prescribed in section
194.096 of this Chapter. In the event an amount is not received by Maumee equal
to such credit claimed and allowed by reason of tax payments made to, or
withheld in, such other municipality then the taxpayer shall be liable to
Maumee for an amount by which the claimed credit exceeds the amount recovered
on such assignment by Maumee, together with penalty and interest. If
satisfactory evidence is offered, however, that the taxpayer is entitled to the
claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit
therefor because of fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
   (C)   Assignment of any claim for refund to which a Maumee resident may be
entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of
that portion of the Maumee income tax represented by such assignment shall not
be refunded until such assignment has been remitted to Maumee by such other
municipality.
   (D)   The credits provided for shall not be allowed unless the same are
claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to, and filed with the Tax
Administrator and presents such evidence of the payment of a similar tax to
another municipality as required by the Tax Administrator. In the event a
taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to file such timely return or form he shall
not be entitled to such credit and shall be liable for the full amount of tax
assessed by this chapter, together with such interest and penalties, both civil
and criminal, as are prescribed in this chapter.
   (E)   No credit shall be given for any state or school district income tax.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
194.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
194.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 194.081 of this
Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.09 ANNUAL RETURN.

   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal

of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
194.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
194.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
194.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

194.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other documents is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of Postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this section, "receiving that payment" refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
         (Ord. 230-2016. Passed 12-19-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
194.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

meaning as in section
194.052 of this chapter.

expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's

include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any

information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the

support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with

tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
municipal return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the
fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under this Chapter, for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2023,the tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any
notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the
taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due date to file the
return, whichever occurs first. If a tax administrator violates division (G)(3)
of this section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
This section does not apply to an extension received under this section if the
tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a
federal extension as required to receive the extension or failed to file for an
extension under this section.

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,

section

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in section
194.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or

dollars ($10).
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal

refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described

and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 169-2015. Passed
10-5-15.)
   194.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six (6)
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to section
194.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
194.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
194.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
194.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
194.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
194.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
(60) days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five (5) years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two (2) years. There is
no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B) Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax Administrator
shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the taxpayer's right
to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the
assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed, and to whom
the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under
division (C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to
prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the
taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney
at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary
mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing
the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 169-2015. Passed 10-5-15.)
   194.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final
or, if any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax
Review, the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination
of the Local Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in
part or ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation,
in whole or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
194.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
194.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

CHAPTER.
   (A)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
194.81(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95of the Revised Code, Sections

   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the Municipality, on a form prescribed by

      (2)   (a)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Municipality of its
termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Sections
194.80 to

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the

that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
194.03 of the Maumee Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   194.81 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
194.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
194.82 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net

profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made    and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is beingconducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.

property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section 194.03 of the
Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar provision of
the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall
add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that
was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to
add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)

194.80 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator   shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

the basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the

commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under

      (5)   When an election made under Section
194.80 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section

deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity'snet
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.82 of the Codified Ordinances, include theproperty, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
194.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
194.82 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

   194.87  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
194.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   194.88 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the   income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-28.)
   194.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
194.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
194.91
 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater
of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty
imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on
any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   194.90 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
194.91 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
194.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   194.91 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-28.)
   194.92 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
194.80 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
194.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
194.91 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
194.91 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 025-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
   194.93 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Municipality and taxpayer under Section
194.064 or
194.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.

submitted to it; and as to each improvement, the Board shall, after such
hearing, amend, equalize and adjust the assessment report, and shall report to
City Council its findings as to the necessity for the improvement, any
amendment it directs in the assessments, the estimates of benefits and
allowances of damages.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.07 CLAIMS OF DAMAGE.
   Any owner of a lot or land bounding and abutting upon a proposed improvement
claiming that he will sustain damages by reason of the improvement shall
present such claim to the Board of Revision of Assessments within two (2) weeks
after the service of notice or the completion of the publication herein before
provided. Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of
damage claimed with a general description of the property with respect to which
it is claimed the damage will accrue, and shall be filed with the Director of
Finance. Any owner who fails to do so shall be deemed to have waived such
damages and shall be barred from filing a claim or receiving damages therefor.
This provision shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the
improvement, but shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages
arising, without his fault, from acts of the City or its agents during
installation of the improvement. If, subsequent to the filing of such claim,
the owner sells the property, or any part thereof, the right to such damages,
if any, shall follow the ownership of the land without other transference of
the claim. The Board of Revision of Assessments shall report to City Council
all such claims for damages filed with it.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.08 FINAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have made its final
report to City Council as to any improvement, City Council, if it determines
that the improvement shall proceed, shall pass an ordinance levying the
assessment as reported by the Board of Revision of Assessments and directing
that the improvement shall proceed. In such ordinance it shall be sufficient to
describe the lots and lands abutting upon the improvement, and to be assessed
therefor, as all the lots and lands bounding and abutting upon such improvement
between and including the termini of the improvement; and in describing lands
which do not abut, it shall be sufficient to describe the lots by the
appropriate lot numbers and the lands by metes and bounds. This rule of
description shall apply in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be
charged with special assessments. At the completion of the project, the final
in-place quantities, and the costs to be assessed to property owners shall be
submitted to city council for final approval by legislation authorizing
collection of the assessments.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.09  PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS - LIENS.
   Special assessments for any improvement under this chapter shall be payable
in annual installments pursuant to one or more payment schedules as authorized
by City Council in the resolution of necessity or in the final assessment
ordinance. The number of annual installments of any assessment shall not exceed
twenty (20) and the number of annual installments of assessments shall not
exceed the maximum maturity for which securities could be issued in
anticipation of the project. If no period of maximum maturity is so specified,
then the period for which assessments shall be levied, shall not be less than
one (1) year, but may not exceed the estimated life of the usefulness of the
improvement as certified by the fiscal officer of the City of Maumee.
   Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed
at the time stipulated in the ordinance and shall be a lien from the date of
the assessment upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed,
enforceable in the manner provided by general law.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.10  DAMAGES ASSESSED
   At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the
improvements as herein before provided, City Council shall determine whether
the claims for damages so filed shall be allowed and paid or shall be
judicially inquired into as to the proposed improvement. If City Council
decides that the damages shall be assessed as a result of the project, the
Director of Law shall then make a written application to the court of common
pleas, or to the probate court, for the summoning of a jury to determine such
damages, and the judge shall direct that a jury be summoned as is provided for
the appropriation of property and fix the time and place for inquiry into and
assessment of such damages, which inquiry and assessment shall be confined to
such claims. (Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.11 LIMITATION ON DAMAGE SUITS.
   No person who claims damages arising from any cause shall commence a suit
therefor against the City until he shall have filed a claim for such damages
with the City and sixty (60) days shall have elapsed thereafter. This provision
shall not apply to an application for an injunction or other proceeding to
which it may be necessary for such applicant to resort in case of urgent
necessity. (Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.12 WORK TO BE DONE.
   When City Council passes an ordinance directing that an improvement be made
to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessment the City Administrator
shall, through the appropriate department or office, cause the improvement to
be made either directly by employment of labor or by entering into a contract
therefor as may be determined by City Council. Contracts may be entered into
for improvements to be assessed at any time before or after the passage of a
resolution of necessity by City Council for said improvement.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.13 LANDS UNALLOTTED OR NOT ON DUPLICATE.
   When special assessments are to be levies by the percentage of the tax value
of the property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and
abutting upon the improvement and there are lots or lands subject to such
assessment which are not assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance shall
fix, for the purpose of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand
and of such lands at the depth which he considers a fair average of the depth
of lots in the neighborhood, so that the value so fixed will be a fair average
of the assessed value of other lots in the neighborhood. Where lands are not
subdivided into lots, but are assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance
shall fix the value and depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not
apply in making a special assessment according to benefits.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.14  INTEREST ON ASSESSMENT BONDS.
      When bonds or notes are issued in anticipation of the collection of
assessments, the interest and any cost for the bonds or notes, including
attorney fees and additional interest costs thereon shall be treated as part of
the cost of the improvement for which assessments may be made.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.15 LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.

municipal corporation or any part thereof, including sewage disposal works,
treatment plants, and sewage pumping stations, or a water supply system for the
City of Maumee or any part thereof including mains, dams, reservoirs, wells,
intakes, purification works, and pumping stations, and that any such
improvement shall be constructed, enlarged, or improved, may levy upon property
to be benefited in Maumee an assessment upon the benefited lots and lands
within the corporation or such part thereof, apportioned according to benefits
or to the tax valuation or partly by one method and partly by the other, as the
legislative authority determines for the purpose of paying the costs of general
and detailed plans, specifications, estimates, preparation of the tentative
assessment, financing, and legal services incident to the preparation of such
plans, and a plan for financing the proposed improvements.
    Whenever it has determined by ordinance to construct sidewalks, curbs, or
gutters and levy an assessment therefor, city council may require the
construction or repair of sidewalks, curbs, or gutters within the municipal
corporation by the owners of lots or lands abutting thereon, and upon the
failure of such owners to construct or repair such sidewalks, curbs, or gutters
within the time prescribed in the resolution, may cause such sidewalks, curbs,
or gutters to be constructed or repaired and may assess the total cost thereof
against the lots or lands abutting thereon.
   The entire cost may be assessed for sprinkling, sweeping, cleaning, removing
snow from and treating the surface of municipal streets, alleys, and public
ways.
      City Council shall limit all other assessments to the special benefits
conferred upon the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied on
any lot or parcel of land any assessments for any or all purposes within a
period of five (5) years in excess of thirty-three and one-third per cent (33-
1/3%) of the actual value thereof after the improvement is made.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.16  CITY'S PORTION OF COST.
      The City shall pay such part of the cost and expense of improvements for
which special assessments are levied as City Council deems just which part
shall not be less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of all such cost and expense; and in
addition, thereto the City shall pay the cost of intersections. The City shall
not be required to pay any portion of the cost for sidewalks, curbs, or
gutters. City Council may provide for the payment of the City's portion of all
such improvements or the costs of construction of any improvement to be
assessed by the issuance of bonds or notes therefor, by borrowing money, and/or
may levy taxes, in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, to pay such
bonds or notes and the interest thereon.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.17 REPLACING EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
      City Council may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any
existing local improvement by levying special assessments as hereinbefore
provided; but any assessment for replacement in less than twenty (20) years
from the date of a prior assessment for the improvement to be replaced shall be
limited to a sum not in excess of fifty per cent (50%) of the cost of such
replacement. (Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.18  ESTIMATE OF LIFE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every ordinance providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in
part by special assessments may contain an estimate of the life of the proposed
improvement, prepared as may be directed by the City Administrator. If an
estimated life is set forth in the assessment ordinance, any assessment
thereafter made for replacing such improvement within such estimated period of
life shall be limited to a sum not in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the cost
of such replacement. Assessments for replacements at or after the expiration of
such estimated period of life shall be subject to no limitation except as
provided for assessments for original improvements. If no estimated life is set
forth in the assessment ordinance, the life of the improvement shall be set at
fifteen (15) years. (Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.19  REBATES AND SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS.

rebate to the then owner of the property which shall have been assessed to pay
for such improvement, any surplus or excess remaining unexpended for the
purpose for which such assessment was made, and in the event of there being a
deficit in the fund provided for the making of any such improvement the
Director of Finance shall report to City Council a supplementary assessment
within the limitations hereinbefore provided, which supplementary assessment
shall be made by ordinance and certified for collection as is provided in the
case of original assessments.
(Ord. 007-2023. Passed 2-6-23.)
   201.20 SEWER, WATER AND OTHER CONNECTIONS.
      The City Administrator, or the Administrator's designee shall have the
authority to compel the making of or relocation of sewer, water, gas,
electrical, fiber, communications and other utilities and/connections whenever
in view of contemplated street improvements, or as a sanitary regulation, such
connections should in their judgment be relocated or constructed. Written
notice of such determination shall be given to the owner of each lot or parcel
of land to which relocations are required or connections are to be made, which
notice shall state the number and character of connections or relocation
required. Such notice shall be served by a person, designated by the City
Manager, or other officer, by ordinary US mail sent to the property address or
owner of the property as listed with the Lucas County Auditor. Non-residents of

such notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The notice shall
state the time within which such connections shall be constructed and or
relocated, if they be not constructed or relocated within said time, the work
may be done by the City and cost thereof, together with a penalty of five
percent (5%), assessed against the lots and lands for which the connections are
made. Said assessments shall be certified and collected in the same manner as

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFICSIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does
not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section, points
shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic
wireless communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless

voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the

device without a warrant.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand

offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

   (h)   Any person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

of the following apply:
      (1)   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a

      (2)   The person has a concentration of eight-hundredths of one per cent
or more by weight of alcohol per unit volume in the person’s whole blood.

   (c)   In any proceeding arising out of one incident, a person may be charged
with a violation of subsection (a)(1) and a violation of subsection (b)(1),
(2), (3) or (4) of this section, but the person shall not be convicted of more
than one violation of those subsections.
   (d)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent
violation, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them in the defendant’s or child’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, urine, or breath, at the time of the alleged violation
as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn, or specimen taken
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.
When a person submits to a blood test, only a physician, a registered nurse, or
a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection if, in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the defendant or child would be
endangered by withdrawing blood.
The whole blood, blood serum or plasma, urine, or breath shall be analyzed in
accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) of this section, or for a violation of a
prohibition that is substantially equivalent to subsection (a) of this section,
if there was at the time the bodily substance was taken a concentration of less
than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified for a violation of
subsection (a)(2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section, that fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant or in making an adjudication for the child. This subsection does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (b) of this section or for a violation of a prohibition
that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney
immediately upon completion of the test analysis.
The person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer, and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.
   (e)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent
violation, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety test
to the operator or person found to be in physical control of the vessel
underway involved in the violation or the person manipulating the water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device involved in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the testing standards for reliable, credible, and
generally accepted field sobriety tests for vehicles that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered, including, but not limited to, any testing
standards then in effect that have been set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, that by their nature are not clearly inapplicable
regarding the operation or physical control of vessels underway or the
manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes or similar devices, all of the following
apply:
         A.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
         B.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         C.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(1)A. or B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Subsection (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(1) of this section.
   
   (f)   (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of this section or for
an equivalent violation, the court shall admit as prima-facie evidence a
laboratory report from any forensic laboratory certified by the Department of
Health that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection. The laboratory report shall contain
all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of a person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, or a combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in
any proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding,
unless the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s or
child’s attorney, or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the
defendant or child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant or child to whom the report
pertains or the defendant’s or child’s attorney receives a copy of the report,
the defendant or child or the defendant’s or child’s attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend
the seven-day time limit in the interest of justice.
   
   (g)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-
aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim of
assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for
any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided
in this subsection is not available to a person who withdraws blood if the
person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
   (h)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Equivalent violation” means a violation of a municipal ordinance,
law of a state, or law of the United States that is substantially equivalent to
subsection (a) or (b) of this section.

State when the vessel is not securely affixed to a dock or to shore or to any
permanent structure to which the vessel has the right to affix or that a vessel
is not anchored in a designated anchorage area or boat camping area that is
established by the United States Coast Guard, this State, or a political
subdivision and in which the vessel has the right to anchor.

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm

its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal

(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

($5,000.00) for the location change; licensee shall remain responsible for
license fees and renewal fees as outlined in (e)(6) and (g)(4) above .
   (j)   An application for a location change for a local operating license may
be granted on the approval of the License Technician, except as otherwise
provided in this Section. If approval for the location change is granted, a new
local operating license will be issued.
   (k)   Both local provisional licenses and local operating licenses are only
valid as to the particular medical marijuana entity listed in the initial local
provisional license application. If the ownership of a medical marijuana entity
changes, requiring a transfer of ownership application to the State of Ohio
under Chapter 3796:2-1-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code, the medical
marijuana entity must notify the City. If the State of Ohio determines that the
proposed ownership change complies with Chapter 3796:2-1-08, the ownership
change will be permitted by the City under the existing local provisional
license or local operating license. If the State of Ohio determines that a new
state license application is required under Chapter 3976:2-1-08(B)(1)(d) of the
Ohio Administrative Code, then the ownership change will not be permitted by
the City without a new local provisional license and a new local operating
license.
   (l)   As part of the submission of an application that results in the
issuance of a local provisional license or local operating license, a medical
marijuana entity irrevocably consents to the following:
      (1)   Any inspection by the City of Maumee or the Maumee Police
Department that is deemed necessary to ensure compliance by the medical
marijuana entity with this Chapter, Chapter 3796 of the Ohio Revised Code, and

with or without notice. During the inspection, a representative of the City of
Maumee or the Maumee Police Department may:

documents pursuant to HIPPA or other confidentiality provisions that are
maintained in accordance with Rules 3796:2-2-08, 2796:3-2-08, 3796:6-3-18, and
3796:4-2-09 of the Ohio Administrative Code;

entity, including methods of operating;
         E.   Survey the premises and any off-site facilities;

marijuana or currency of $100 has occurred, the medical marijuana entity must
immediately notify the Maumee Police Department, and such notification shall be
provided no later than twenty-four (24) hours after discovery of the loss,
theft, or diversion.
      (3)   If, at any time, any information in a medical marijuana entity's
local provisional license application changes, the medical marijuana entity
must immediately notify the City of Maumee.
   (n)   If at any time, the City becomes aware that a medical marijuana entity
possessing a local provisional license or a local operating license has engaged
in, is engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared to be
prohibited by this Chapter, Chapter 3796 of the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 3796
of the Ohio Administrative Code, or any other local, state, or federal law,
with the exception of acts that are permitted under state law but are federal
law violations stemming from the classification of marijuana as a controlled
substance under 21 U.S.C. §812(c), the Director of Public Safety may do any of
the following:
      (1)   Refer such violations to the Ohio Department of Commerce;
      (2)   Issue a warning to the medical marijuana entity, which may include
possible corrective action(s);
      (3)   Suspend the license and require any violations to be resolved and
corrective actions to be taken as conditions to the reinstatement of the

      (1)   Suspension of licenses shall only be accomplished through the
procedures outlined in this subsection. Suspension shall be accomplished after
a public hearing is held thereon by the Safety Director, which hearing shall be

hearing, by certified mail and regular mail. The licensee shall have the right
to appear at such a hearing, to be represented by counsel, and to have the
right to examine and cross-examine witnesses.
      (2)   Suspension may take place without a prior hearing if the Safety
Director finds clear and convincing evidence that the continued distribution of
medical marijuana presents a danger of immediate and serious harm to others.
Notice of the suspension shall be made as provided in this Section and a
hearing on the merits of the suspension will take place within five (5) days of
the suspension.
      (3)   The suspension will remain in effect, unless lifted by the Safety
Director, pending the results of the hearing. If the Safety Director does not
issue an order within ninety (90) days after the hearing, the suspension shall
be lifted on the ninety-first (91st) day following the hearing.

Safety Director may require any violations to be resolved and reasonable
corrective actions to be taken.

      (1)   Revocation of licenses shall only be accomplished through the

such hearing, by certified mail and regular mail. The licensee shall have the
right to appear at such a hearing, to be represented by counsel, and to have
the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses.
      (2)   If a medical marijuana entity's local provisional license or local
operating license is revoked, the medical marijuana entity's local provisional
license or local operating license is revoked, and the medical marijuana entity
will coordinate with the City of Maumee and the Ohio Department of Commerce in
the closing of the facility as provided for in the Ohio Administrative Code.
   (s)   In the event a decision or ruling of the Safety Director is adverse to
a licensee or license applicant regarding a denial, revocation of suspension of
a license, the licensee or license applicant shall have the right to appeal
such decision and ruling to a court of competent jurisdiction, under authority
of and pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. A
notice of appeal in such action shall be filed with the Office of the Mayor, as
well as with the court to which the action is appealed, within appropriate time
limits, as provided in Chapter 2505 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (t)   The Safety Director shall have the authority to deny any application
for a local provisional license, local operating license, license renewal, or a
location change, at his/her discretion, pursuant to the criteria of this
Chapter.

forth. Before any such application shall be granted and the water mains, lines,
pipes, or conduits of the City connected with lines outside of the City limits,
the Director of Public Service shall approve the size, character, and location
of such lines and the person, firm, corporation, political subdivision, or part
thereof owning or controlling such lines or pipes in public highways or
thoroughfares shall agree that if the territory in which such lines or pipes
are located is thereafter annexed to the City, upon such annexation, such water
lines, pipes, and conduits shall become the property of the City without any
cost or expense to the City, and any right, title, or interest of any other
party therein or thereto shall then cease and terminate. Compliance with the
foregoing conditions shall be deemed consideration for any application to

Commissioner shall cause written notice of this determination thereof to be
given to the owner of each lot or parcel of land to which such connections are
to be made, which notice shall state the number and character of the
connections required. Such notice shall be served by a person designated by the
Director or Commissioner in the manner provided for service of summons in civil
actions, provided that owners who are nonresidents or persons who cannot be
found shall be served by publication of such notice in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City. The notice shall state the time within which such
connections shall be constructed, and if they are not constructed within such
time, the work may be done by the City and the cost thereof assessed against
the lots and lands for which such connections are made. Such assessments shall

927.05, or any area under the jurisdiction of the City, any human or animal
excrement, garbage or other waste without a permit or written authorization
from the City of Maumee.
(Ord. 050-2022. Passed 11-7-22.)
   927.03 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE OF WASTEWATER.
   It shall be unlawful to discharge, without written authorization or a permit
from the City of Maumee or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to any
natural outlet within the City, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the

approval by the Service Director.
(Ord. 050-2022. Passed 11-7-22.)
   927.04  PRIVIES, SEPTIC TANKS OR CESSPOOLS PROHIBITED.
   Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or

employment, recreation or other purpose, situated within the City and abutting
on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in
the future be located a public sanitary sewer is hereby required at his their
expense, to install and use suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect
such facilities directly with the public sewer in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 037-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
SEWER RATES AND CHARGES
   927.06  PURPOSE OF SEWER CHARGES.
   It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary for the protection of
the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the residents of the
City, to establish, levy and collect charges or rentals upon all lots, lands,
buildings and premises served by or having connections with the sanitary
sewerage system of the City or having the connections available to the same.
(Ord. 037-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
   927.07  SANITARY SEWER FUND.
   (a)   There is hereby created and established a Sanitary Sewer Fund. All
moneys received in accordance with this chapter shall be deposited with the
Director of Finance and kept in such Fund.
   (b)   Moneys in such Fund shall be used, when appropriated by Council, for
the payment of the cost and expense of handling, transmission, pumping and
disposal of sewage and the management, maintenance, operation and repair of the
sanitary and combined sewerage system, and to the extent permitted or
authorized by law, for the construction, enlargement or replacement of such
system or sewerage works.
    (c)    Moneys in said fund, grants and loans shall also be used for repair
or replacement of sewer laterals that are determined to be a nuisance as
defined herein for properties that are eligible for the use of said funds,
grants or loans as determined by programs established by the City. The repair
or replacement of sewer laterals on private property that involves expenditure
of public funds or use of City property or city employees, or use of City of
Maumee resources in resolving nuisance conditions, would be for and serve a
public purpose as defined by Ohio law; that the expenditure of funds and/or use
of public property and/or provision of city employees would be for the general
good of the residents and taxpayers of the City of Maumee and the general
public; and promotes the public health and general welfare of the citizens of
the City of Maumee and the general public. The expenditure of public funds for
private sewer lateral repairs would be more cost effective than paying for
unneeded sanitary sewer treatment for clean water, and would be more cost
effective than building storage tanks and related additional conveyance
capacity for capturing and storing sanitary sewer overflows.

disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory
to the Service Director. No sewer contractor shall open any pavement on any
public or private property without first receiving written permission from the
Director or proper authorities. At least forty-eight hours notice shall be
given for this permission. Where the trench method is used through paved or
unpaved streets, roads, driveways, alleys, etc., it will be necessary to use
granular material or limestone screenings as required by the Director for
backfill. It shall be placed in layers of not more than six inches and tamped
with a mechanical tamp or puddled in layers at the direction of the Director.
After the backfill is thoroughly compacted, it will be necessary to replace the
pavement with the same type of materials as was removed, and in no case shall
substitute paving materials be used without first securing the approval of the
proper authority. All surplus excavation shall be removed from the site to a
location satisfactory to the Director, leaving the berms and pavements in
substantially the same condition as before construction started. All of the
above mentioned work and material shall be performed in accordance with the
standard specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation. At all
locations where the building sewer passes under another sewer, drainage pipe,
water main or other utility, the line passed under shall be supported by
material and a method approved by the Director and extra precaution will be
required in backfilling and tamping the trench in order to avoid any danger of
a break, settlement or crack in the line passed under.

otherwise endanger life, limb or public property or constitute a nuisance. The
Service Director may set limitations more stringent than the limitations
established herein if, in his opinion, such more stringent limitations are
necessary to meet the above-mentioned objectives. Deliberate dilution with
unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in this chapter shall
not be acceptable. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the Director
will give consideration to such facts as the quantity of subject waste in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the
wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the
wastewater treatment plant and other pertinent factors. The limitations or
restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged
to the wastewater treatment works which shall not be violated without approval
of the Director are as follows:

as provided in Section
927.43. However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes
may be used, subject to mutual agreement between the Service Director and the
owner.
   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes
shall be made by the owner, or his qualified agent as approved by the Service
Director. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the City on a
monthly basis on forms provided by the City. The City shall make its own
analyses on the wastes periodically. In case the analyses performed by the
owner and the City result in substantially different values, an effort shall be
made by the owner to collect samples at the same time the City collects
samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected by the City and
the owner shall be compared, using the same testing procedures as outlined in
Section
927.43, and the differences negotiated. In the event the differences cannot be
resolved, the determination performed by the City shall be binding.

   (c)   Illicit Discharge, Detection and Elimination.
      (1)   Permit Requirement.
         A.   The City has developed, implemented, and enforces a program to
detect and eliminate illicit discharges into your small Municipal Separate
Storm Sewer System (MS4).
         B.   The City will complete, a storm sewer map showing the location of
all outfalls and the names and location of all surface waters of the State and
receive discharges from those outfalls.
         C.   The City will develop a list all known on-site sewage disposal
systems connected to discharge to your MS4 (aka home sewage treatment systems
(HSTS)) including the addresses and indicate on a storm sewer map the location
of HSTS's connected to the MS4. The map shall include details on the type and
size of conduits/ditches in the MS4 that receive discharges from the HSTS's, as
well as the water bodies that receive discharge from your MS4. This information
will be submitted to Ohio EPA.
         D.   The City has to the extent allowable under State and local law,
effectively prohibit, through ordinance, or other regulatory mechanism, illicit
discharges into your storm sewer system and implement appropriate enforcement
procedures and actions.
         E.   The City has developed and implemented a plan to detect and
eliminate nonstorm water discharges, including illegal dumping to your system.
         F.   The City has and will continue to inform public employees,
businesses, and the general public of hazards associated with illegal
discharges and improper disposal of waste.
         G.   The City does not consider the following categories of non-storm
water discharges or flows (i.e., illicit discharges) to be them as significant
contributors of pollutants to our small MS4; water line flushing, landscape
irrigation, diverted stream flows, rising ground waters, uncontaminated ground
water infiltration, uncontaminated pumped ground water, discharges from potable
water sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation
water, springs, water from crawl space pumps, footing drains, lawn watering,
individual residential car washing, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands,
dechlorinated swimming pool discharges, street wash water, and discharges or
flows from fire fighting activities (by definition, not an illicit discharge).
      (2)   BMP Decision Process. The City of Maumee has developed a plan to
eliminate illicit discharges from their MS4. The plan consists of an ordinance
with penalty provisions, a map of the system, and procedures to locate and
eliminate illicit discharges. A public education component of the plan will be
aimed at the residents and businesses and industries located within the City.
The goal of the program will be met through an aggressive detection,
elimination and enforcement program supplemented by an education program.

   (d)   Construction Site Storm Water Runoff Control.
      (1)   Permit Requirement. The City has developed, implemented, and
enforces a program to reduce pollutants in any storm water runoff to your small
MS4 from construction activities that result in a land disturbance of greater
than or equal to one acre. Reduction of pollutants in storm water discharges
from construction activity disturbing less than one acre is included in our
program if that construction activity is part of a larger common plan of
development for sale that would disturb one acre or more. If Ohio EPA waives
requirements for storm water discharges associated with small construction from
a specific site(s), The City is not required to enforce our program to reduce
pollutant discharges from such site(s). The program will include at a minimum:
         A.   An ordinance or other regulatory mechanism to require erosion and
sediment controls, as well as sanctions to ensure compliance to the extent
allowable under State or local law;
         B.   Requirements for construction site operators to implement
appropriate erosion and sediment control BMPs;
         C.   Requirements for construction site operators to control waste
such as discharged building materials, concrete truck wash out, chemicals,
litter, and sanitary wastes at the construction site that might cause adverse
impacts to water quality;
         D.   Procedures for site plan review which incorporate consideration
of potential water quality impacts;
         E.   Procedures for receipt and consideration of information submitted
by the pubic; and
         F.   Procedures for site inspection and enforcement of control
measures.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process. Sediment and erosion controls applied to
construction sites are important mechanisms for helping to reduce storm water
pollutants. The City of Maumee's construction site runoff control program
consists of sediment and erosion controls from construction sites as well as
penalty provisions. The City has also reviewed existing construction/building
ordinances for their applicability to the Storm Water Management Plan. An
inspection plan including site reviews and inspection goals have been developed
and implemented. Inspectors will be trained in newly developed procedures. A
storm water hotline has been implemented to facilitate receiving public input.
A workshop will be scheduled with contractors and developers explaining the
regulations and enforcement procedures. Through a combination of legal,
inspection and educational activities, the City will achieve its goal to
eliminate or minimize the impact sediment in storm water can have on the
aquatic environment.

storm water runoff from new development and redevelopment projects that disturb
greater than or equal to one acre, including projects less than one acre that
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale, that discharge to the
small MS4. The program will ensure that controls are in place that would
prevent or minimize water quality impacts.
         B.   The City will develop and implement strategies, which include a
combination of structural and/or non-structural BMPs appropriate for our
community.
         C.   The City will prepare and adopt an ordinance to address post-
construction run-off from new development and redevelopment projects to the
extent allowable by State and local law.
         D.   The City will ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance
of BMPs.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process. The City of Maumee will prepare and adopt an
ordinance requiring control from new and existing development sites including
penalty provisions. Existing regulations will be reviewed for their
applicability to the Post-Construction Runoff Control requirements. An
inspection/compliance plan will be developed to make certain controls are in
place and working and citizen's concerns are addressed. Maumee will utilize
zoning provisions to make certain new or redevelopment is done in a manner,
which will minimize runoff and be most appropriate for the community. The City
will conduct meetings with developers to explain the ordinance and inspection/
compliance plan and their long-term impact. Zoning and building inspection
personnel will be trained on storm water runoff implications to the community.

maintenance, fleet and building maintenance, new construction and land
disturbances and storm water system maintenance.
      (2)   BMP Decision Process.
         A.   The City of Maumee's Divisions of Sewers, Operations, Natural
Resources, Water and Construction are all subject to operations and maintenance
program designed to prevent or reduce pollutant runoff to the City's MS4. The
City wants to provide their employees with information on how to best minimize
the release of pollutants as well as the benefits of the program to the
environment. The City will train employees on the proper handling and disposal
of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Proper maintenance of salt spreading,
street sweeping and sewer cleaning vehicles will also be included in the City's
program.
         B.   In an effort to minimize pollutant loading to their MS4, the City
will sweep all curbed streets four times per year, clean 200 catch basins
yearly and inspect 25% of ditches annually, and clean as needed.
         C.   The City currently has a used automobile and truck fluid
recycling program and a covered salt storage building. A drying area is
currently utilized for materials removed from street sweeping and catch basins
prior to land filling. The present system will be evaluated and updated as
needed.
         D.   The selection of BMPs and their impact on preventing or
minimizing pollutant runoff will be evaluated through a survey that will be
developed by the City and made available to Maumee residents, businesses. The
responses to this survey will be evaluated and recommendations made on BMP
selection.

economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of erosion and sediment
control that will minimize damage to property and degradation of water
resources and wetlands, and will promote and maintain the health and safety of
the citizens of the City of Maumee.
   This regulation will:
Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and sedimentation.
Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and wetlands that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   This regulation applies to all parcels used or being developed, either
wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways,
underground cables, or pipelines; subdivisions or larger common plans of
development; industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential projects;
building activities on farms; redevelopment activities; general clearing; and
all other uses that are not specifically exempted in Section
937.01.
   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in compliance
with, the Ohio Sediment Pollution Abatement Program, OAC Chapter 901:13-1 and
OAC 1501:3-12-02.

construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   At a minimum, the SWP3 shall include controls and performance measures
describing:
   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of practices
that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent practicable.
   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls that
are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of control
practices designed to re-stabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.
   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that control
the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of, and
detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff
in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone
are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with
a sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices shall be functional
throughout the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and
perimeter sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within
seven (7) days from start of grubbing, and shall continue to function until the
up slope development area is restabilized.
   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials. Disposal practices for construction demolition and debris (C&DD)
wastes shall be outlined in the SWP3.
   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a street,
catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is prohibited. A
designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be stored in
a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area
with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all containers in the
storage area.
   SPCC and/or Fuel Spill: Provisions for a Spill Prevention, Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plan must be included in the SWP3. Notification
requirements in the event of fuel spills less than 25 gallons and in excess of
35 gallons must be included.
   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste shall be
disposed of properly.
   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or turbid
discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering activities.
If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a sediment-
settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device, prior to
being discharged from the construction site. Trench and groundwater control
must comply with applicable provisions in the latest version of the Ohio EPA
Construction General Permit.
   The site operator shall maintain current records pertaining to the approval
and implementation of the SWP3 on site and make them available for inspection
by authorized City or State personnel.
(Ord. 269-2018. Passed 12-17-18.)
   937.10 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS.
   All controls on the site shall be inspected at least once every seven
calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per 24 hour period.
   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the
entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather
conditions (e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen).
   The applicant shall assure that qualified inspection personnel conduct
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.
   Unless otherwise approved, the applicant shall hire and assign qualified
third party inspectors to conduct the weekly and post-rainfall inspections.
These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to
precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential for,
pollutants entering the drainage system.
Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be observed
to ensure that they are operating correctly.

    (a)   Members. The Board shall consist of five (5) members. These members
shall be residents of the City who are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by
Council. In connection with the first appointment of such members the terms
shall be:: one for three years, two for four years, two for five years; the

quorum. All applications properly coming before the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall be considered during an adjudicative hearing process as defined in
Section
1105.09 (Adjudicative Hearing Requirements).
   (c)   Jurisdiction of Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   Appeal to Board of Zoning Appeals.
         A.   An appeal from any action or ruling, except those related to
Design Standards, of the Zoning Administrator based upon the provisions of this
Zoning Code may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals within thirty (30)
calendar days from such action or the announcement of such ruling.
         B.   Within the period aforesaid, the appellant shall file with the
Zoning Administrator and with the Board of Zoning Appeals a written notice of
appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, accompanied by any fee which may be
directed by Ordinance of Council.
         C.   The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action or ruling appealed
from was taken, and an adjudicative hearing shall be held on the matter in
accordance with Section
1105.09 (Adjudicative Hearing Requirements).
       (2)   Variance. 
         A.   The Board of Zoning Appeals upon written application therefore by
a party in interest may authorize by permit a variation of the application of
the regulations herein established as follows:
            (i)   Permit a variation in the minimum lot area, landscaping
requirements under Chapter
1145, setback line, minimum floor area, off-street parking, and fencing
requirements of any district when there are practical difficulties in
implementing the provisions of this Zoning Code. The Board shall have no power
to allow a change of use to one not permitted in the district.
            (ii)   The Board may adopt, amend and enforce such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary or desirable to carry on its functions and
provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Code in accordance with the purpose
and intent hereof.
            (iii)   The Board has the authority to attach to the issuance of a
variance such conditions as it determines to be necessary for the general
health, safety, and welfare, and the protection of neighboring properties, and
failure to comply with such conditions shall render the variance null and void.
            (iv)   The Board may vote to delegate limited authority to the
Zoning Administrator to issue variances within defined parameters adopted by
the Board. Such delegation of authority shall only be given for frequently
recurring cases where Board precedent has clearly prescribed appropriate
conditions and safeguards to maintain the intent and spirit of the zoning
district in conformity with this Zoning Code and as will not be contrary to the
public interest.
            (v)    The Board may review applications for home occupations upon
referral from the Zoning Administrator.
         B.   In making a determination whether a variance is to be granted,
the Board shall determine whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning
requirement is observed by granting the variance. The Board shall consider and
weigh each of the following factors to the extent applicable in deciding if
landowners have encountered "practical difficulties" in using their property:
            (i)   Whether there can be any beneficial use of the property
without the variance regardless of financial consideration;
            (ii)   Whether the variance is substantial in relation to the
Zoning Code requirement;
            (iii)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would
be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            (iv)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
            (v)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction;
            (vi)   Whether the property owner's predicament can be feasibly
remedied through some method other than a variance.
            (vii)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
can be observed by granting the variance.
             (viii)   Whether the need for a variance is self-created.
         C.   Any variance lawfully granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall expire after one (1) year from the date of such approval unless, within
such period, the applicant has received a Zoning and Building Permit
       (3)   Sign Variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals upon written
application by a party in interest may authorize a variance for a sign which
does not comply with the provisions of Chapter
1143 (Signs) if, in addition to the requirements of Section
1105.02(c)(2)B., it determines that all of the following factors are met:
         A.   The particular sign will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of Chapter
1143 (Signs);
         B.   The sign will not be injurious to the immediate neighborhood or
adjacent land use;
         C.   The sign is sufficiently compatible with the architectural and
design character of the immediate neighborhood; and
         D.   The sign will not be hazardous to passing traffic or otherwise
detrimental to the public safety and welfare.
          In granting such variance, the Board shall specify the size, type,
lighting mechanism, and location of the sign and impose such other reasonable
terms, restrictions, and conditions as it may deem to be in the public
interest.
      (4)   Nonconforming Uses.  The Board shall administer the provisions of
Section
1130.06 (Alterations of Nonconforming Uses) and all other sections of the
Zoning Code that apply relative to nonconforming uses.
       (5)   Temporary Accessory Structures. Grant a variance for a temporary
structure in a residential district which is incidental to the marketing of the
residential development for a period of not more than one (1) year.
   (d)   Decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals:  For each request which
appears before the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board shall issue a separate
written order incorporating the specific relief requested, the decision of the
Board, and the basis for the Board's decision. The decision shall be forwarded
to the Zoning Administrator who shall, upon receipt of a decision granting the
requested relief, issue a Zoning Permit in conformity with the Board's
decision, provided that the proposal complies in all other respects with the
provisions of this Zoning Code, and applicable State and Federal Law. A
permanent registry of the decisions of the Board shall be maintained
permanently by address in the office of the Zoning Administrator.

      (7)   Vibrations, which can be detected without the use of instruments at
or beyond the property lines, are prohibited.
   (i)   Performance Standards For Sexually Oriented Uses. Sexually oriented
business uses are categorized as any establishment consisting of, including, or
having the characteristics of any or all of the following uses: adult arcade,
adult bookstore, adult cabaret, adult motel, adult motion picture theater,
adult-only entertainment establishment, adult theater, escort agency, nude
model studio, sexual encounter center, or sexually oriented spa. Specific
definitions are provided in Chapter
1101 (Definitions) as part of the definition of a sexually oriented business;
however, sexually oriented business activities shall not include massage
parlors, as defined in Chapter
1101, or obscene materials or prostitution, as regulated in the Maumee Criminal
Code. Sexually oriented business uses have additional regulations imposed to
protect children from accidental or other exposure to adult materials and
activities and because of the likelihood to produce harmful secondary health,
safety, and aesthetic effects on residential neighborhoods and other specified
land uses. These additional regulations include the following:   
      (1)   No sexually-oriented business shall be established within one
thousand (1,000) feet of any:
         (A)   Residential Zoning District R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-4, and others
as they may be established;
         (B)   Library, educational institution, park, recreational facility,
religious place of worship, child day care facility, playground, or swimming
pool;
         (C)   Planned Unit Development that includes residential land uses; or
         (D)   Bar, tavern, or other establishment offering the sale of beer or
intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises regulated by the Ohio
Division of Liquor Control (ORC Title 43).
      (2)   No sexually oriented business shall be established within five
hundred (500) feet of any other sexually oriented business.
      (3)   For the purpose of this Section, measurement shall be made in a
straight line, without regard to the intervening structures or objects, from
the nearest portion of the structure used as the part of the premises where a
sexually oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property line of the
premises of a use listed above in this section. Presence of a municipal,
county, or other political subdivision boundary shall be irrelevant for
purposes of calculating and applying the distance requirements of this
Section.   
      (4)   Prohibited Public Display. No displays, promotions, or
advertisement which depict or describe adult materials, specified sexual
activities or specified anatomical areas shall be shown, distributed or
exhibited so as to be visible to the public from any other privately owned
property, pedestrian sidewalks or walkways, or from other public or semi-public
areas.
      (5)   Public View to Be Prevented. All building openings, entries,
windows, and doors of sexually oriented businesses shall be located, covered,
or serviced in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any
other privately owned property, pedestrian sidewalks or walkways, or from other
public or semi-public areas. For new construction, the building shall be
oriented so as to minimize any possibility of viewing the interior from any
other privately owned property, pedestrian sidewalks or walkways, or from other
public or semi-public areas.
      (6)   External Audio and Visual Impact. No screens, loudspeakers, or
sound equipment shall be used for adult motion picture theaters (enclosed or
drive-in) or any other sexually oriented businesses shall be operated in such a
manner as to be seen or discerned by the general public from any other
privately owned property, pedestrian sidewalks or walkways, or from other
public or semi-public areas.
      (7)   Exterior Signage  Exterior identification signage is permitted
subject to other applicable provisions of these regulations. However, to limit
exposure of sexual images to minors, no exterior signage shall include sexually
explicit verbal messages, graphics, drawings, or other illustrations of
specified sexual anatomical areas or specified sexual activities.
   (j)   Interpretation.  In interpreting the performance standard of these
sections, either the Building and Zoning Inspector or the applicant may request
an interpretation from the Planning Commission.
      (1)   For the purposes of such interpretation the Planning Commission may
consider a written report on the expected performance of the subject use by a
qualified consultant appointed by the Commission. The applicant shall pay fees
for such consulting services.
      (2)   Failure of the Planning Commission to give an interpretation within
forty-five (45) calendar days from of the date the request is first heard shall
be considered an interpretation favorable to the applicant.
         (Ord. 088-2019. Passed 5-6-19.)
   1125.14 LOT AREA; YARD AREA; FLOOR AREA; BULK REGULATIONS.
   The following schedule provides the minimum lot, yard and floor areas, and
the maximum height for uses and structures erected, relocated, rebuilt or
structurally altered within a zoning district in the City.   
   (a)   Lot Frontage.  Minimum lot frontage requirements shall be equivalent
to minimum lot width requirements. However, for lots on the turning circle of a
public cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage shall not be less than thirty-five
(35) feet in all districts.
   (b)   Corner Lots. All portions of lots which front public rights of way
shall be considered front yards with a maximum required front yard of twenty-
five (25) feet on the secondary street (see schedule of district regulations
footnote (iv) in this Section). The rear yard is defined as the yard opposite
the front door, or principle entrance of the structure. Accessory structures
shall not be permitted in a required front yard and must have a setback from
any street that is equal to or greater than that of the principle structure.
   (c) Yard Requirements.
      (1)   No yard or other open space provided to comply with this ordinance
shall be counted toward compliance toward allowance for another principle
structure on a particular property.
      (2)   Land Uses within Required Yards.
         A.   Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky except
where accessory structures are permitted in a rear yard and except for the
ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices and ornamental features
projecting not more than eighteen inches (18"), eaves projecting more than two
(2) feet, and uncovered front porches and steps on residential structures
projecting not more than eight (8) feet from the front of the structure. But in
no case shall any of these projections be less than three (3) feet from a side
lot line or six (6) feet from a front lot line, except uncovered front porches
or steps that project into a required front yard shall not project beyond the
sides of a residential structure into a required side yard.
         B.   Portable storage/moving units and temporary dumpsters between ten
(10) and forty (40) yards capacity may be located in the front or side yard for
no more than thirty (30) days and must be located on a hard surface. A letter
of approval must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator prior to placing
these units or dumpsters on a lot. No refuse disposal container may be placed
on a lot for more than thirty (30) days. Every effort must be made to shield
them from view at street level. No portion of a portable storage/moving unit or
dumpster may be located in the public right of way unless a letter authorizing
same is obtained from the Director of Public Service or their designee.    
         C.   Adjacent, incompatible uses: A lot or parcel in a C-1, C-2, C-4,
C-M, M-1, or M-2 District which is adjacent to the front, back, or side yard of
a lot or parcel in a R-1, R-2, R-2A or R-3 District shall meet or exceed the
following:
            (i)   No refuse, garbage, trash or container for refuse, garbage or
trash, merchandise, building materials, vehicle or other material or equipment
shall be stored or placed within the minimum yards as required by this section.
            (ii)   If permitted within such zoning district, materials or
equipment may be stored or placed in yards other than such required yards
listed in the schedule of district requirements in this section, only if they
are screened in such a way so that the same are not visible by persons at grade
level in the R-1, R-2, R-2A or R-3 Districts measured a minimum ten (10) feet
from the abutting property line. Such screening shall be constructed and
maintained at a height determined by the Urban Planning Manager to provide
maximum screening, provided said screening shall not exceed eight (8) feet in
height. All materials for said screening shall not be made of t-111 wood or
other easily degradable material as determined by the Urban Planning Manager,
and shall be constructed of similar materials to match or blend with the
principle structure in appearance, color, and texture. If decorative masonry or
wood is used, upright evergreens shall, in addition thereto, be planted on the
side of the wall or fence nearest to the residential district. The maximum
spacing between such plantings shall not exceed five (5) feet. Landscaping
shall also be required to be planted on the side nearest the residential
district. This landscaping shall be in addition to that which is required by
Chapter
1145. The landscaping plan, screening materials and height shall be reviewed
and approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. All landscaping
shall meet the size and spacing requirements contained in Chapter
1145.
   (d)   Height. (Height shall be measured midway through the gable for non-
flat roofs). In order to comply with the requirements of this section, the
height of any structure shall be no greater than the maximum height set out

FOOTNOTES TO SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS
i.   Upon the construction, relocation, and/or reconstruction of any structure
on a lot in the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, M-2, OS or C-M Districts which is
adjacent to a residential district, the required yard setbacks in those areas
abutting the residential district shall be equal to the yard setbacks required
in the adjacent residential district. Such yard shall be landscaped in addition
to the requirements of Chapter
1136 (Design Review) and Chapter
1145 (Minimum Landscaping Requirements) in order to effectively screen the
Commercial or Industrial property from the residential district. The
landscaping plan for this area shall be approved at the discretion of the Urban
Planning Manager. A lot in the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, M-2, OS or C-
M Districts shall be considered adjacent to a residential district although a
street or other public way is interposed between such lot and the residence
district.
ii.   There shall be no height limitation in the M-2 District except where it
may adjoin a residence district, then, any structure shall comply with
subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and with all applicable sections of
Chapter
1136 (Design Review) and Chapter
1145 (Minimum Landscape Requirements), but shall be set back from the boundary
of the residence district a minimum distance of one foot for each foot of
structure height.
iii.   The last unit in a row of double zero lot-line homes must have a side
yard of eight (8) feet, unless such lot is a corner lot, in which case two
front yards are required.
iv.    Required yard setbacks and lot size may be varied at the discretion of
the City Administrator in consultation with the Law Director and Urban Planning
Manager. The City Administrator or Urban Planning Manager shall consider the
design, size, and use of the proposed structure, surrounding structures, and
the impact the variance might have on the surrounding neighborhood. Preference
must error toward denser use of lots and locating principle structures closer
to the right of way and locating required parking to the rear whenever
possible.
v.    New building construction in these districts must complement nearby
environs. Buildings should be multiple stories. Single story buildings may be
permitted under special circumstances or with certain uses. All single story
buildings shall be reviewed and approved at the discretion of the City
Administrator after consultation with the Urban Planning Manager.
vi.    Development agreements may also be entered into by the City
Administrator which vary the requirements of these District Regulations.
vii.    In CM districts, Multi Family uses within a CM district shall have a
minimum height of forty (40) feet not including parapets and a minimum of four
(4) stories

1125, three overlay zoning districts are established and include a Design
Review Overlay District, a Planned Unit Development Overlay District, and the
Fallen Timbers Overlay District.
   1127.02 DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The purpose of this district is to protect unique areas in the City of
Maumee by defining architectural standards and design review mechanism. Unless
specifically modified by the overlay zone the requirements of the underlying
zoning district are maintained along with the additional requirements of the
overlay zone. Overlay districts allow modifications and impose further
restrictions to maintain the character and/or architectural integrity of
important sites, districts, or structures within the City. This section also
establishes the procedures by which sites and structures within the overlay
zone shall be reviewed.
   1127.03 DESIGNATION OF A DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   In order for a site, structure or district to be zoned as a Design Review
Overlay District, the Design Review Board shall first recommend to Council, the
site, structure or district be designated as a Design Review District. The
boundaries of the overlay district shall be shown on the District Map, and, in
addition to regulations established in the underlying zoning district, all
regulations set forth in this section shall also apply. Design Review Districts
shall apply to both historic areas of Maumee and to more contemporary corridors
and neighborhoods where urban design considerations are deemed to be
particularly important and worthy of additional standards and review.
   1127.04 AMENDMENTS TO THE UNDERLYING DISTRICTS.
   The establishment of a Design Review Overlay District shall not in any way
prohibit a qualified applicant from seeking a change in the underlying zoning
district, in accordance with procedures for amendments as described in this
Zoning Code. However, a change in the underlying zoning district shall not
affect the ability of the City of Maumee or its representatives to enforce the
provisions of the overlay district as described in this section, regardless of
the underlying zoning district.
   1127.05 STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR AREAS ZONED AS A DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY
DISTRICT.
   Design review standards and guidelines shall be developed to provide
specific standards for each Design Review Overlay District. Such standards
shall address preferred methods for modifications and reuse of historic
structures and methods to encourage compatible new development within the
Design Review Overlay District.
   (a)   The specific standards and guidelines developed for each Design Review
District shall include the following:
      (1)   Design review standards and guidelines shall not limit new
construction to any one historical period or architectural style, but shall
seek to insure compatibility with relevant historical or contextual urban
design considerations of a neighborhood, district or corridor.
      (2)   Design review standards that address historical areas shall utilize
the review criteria and standards contained herein.
      (3)   The use, lot area, and bulk regulations in a particular Design
Review Overlay District shall be in accordance with the applicable underlying
zoning district, except as the use, area, and yard regulations may be expressly
modified or revised in accordance with this section.
   (b)   Design Review Guidelines may address:
      (1)   Design.
      (2)   Building height.
      (3)   Building width.
      (4)   Roof type.
      (5)   Building materials consisting of the type characteristic of the
century or period.
      (6)   Ornamentation of features such as window and door lintels, quoins,
soffits, cornices, fences, railing and the like.
      (7)   Walkway paving materials.
      (8)   Building setback from the street line.
      (9)   Color or colors of the exterior as related to color or colors of
surrounding structures.
      (10)   Arrangements of the structures on the lot.
      (11)   Scale, placement and design of signage.

   1127.10 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development Overlay District (PUD) is to
achieve land development that is responsive to the natural and environmental
assets and liabilities of a given site. The PUD provides an alternative overlay
zoning category that is intended to encourage imaginative design of
development. The PUD shall be a well-integrated development in terms of major
design elements such as roads, drainage systems, utilities, and open space. The
PUD allows greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected
and development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner.
   1127.11 PUD OVERLAY DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   All PUD Preliminary Plan submissions are applications for amendment to this
Zoning Code according to Chapter 1107 and shall be considered in accordance
with the procedures for rezoning.
   (a)   Property proposed to be developed as a PUD must first be rezoned to
include the PUD Overlay District. Approval of a Preliminary Development Plan is
a rezoning of the property to a PUD Overlay District.
   (b)   Upon approval of a PUD Preliminary Development Plan, the District Map
shall be amended to designate the property as a "PUD Overlay."
   (c)   A PUD Overlay District Designation may be proposed in any conventional
zoning district. When approved, the zoning designation for the subject property
shall include the conventional zoning district name along with the PUD Overlay
notation.
   (d)   If the conventional zoning district also requires amendment, this
amendment shall occur concurrently with the PUD Preliminary Development Plan
approval.
   1127.12 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   An applicant may propose to include a ratio of not less than seventy-
five (75) percent from the list of the permitted or conditional uses for the
underlying zoning district, and not more than twenty-five (25) percent from the
list of the permitted or conditional uses from any other zoning district except
those uses listed in the "M" districts.
   (b)   Combinations of residential types may be proposed to allow greater
design flexibility. This combination of residential types may include single-
family detached dwellings, two-family dwellings, zero lot line units, and
multiple-family dwellings.
   1127.13 PUD DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   In addition to design standards and any conditions of approval required by
Council, the following standards shall apply to a Planned Unit Development.
   (a)   Planned Unit Developments must be:
      (1)   Developed in accordance with the general or specific objectives of
the Master Plan;
      (2)   Designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in such manner as
to be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the general
vicinity;
      (3)   Would not be hazardous to existing or future neighboring uses;
      (4)   Would be served adequately by essential public infrastructure,
facilities, and services, or provides at the applicant's expense for the
construction of additional public infrastructure, facilities, and/or services
which would adequately service such use; and
      (5)   Would not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment, or conditions of operation which would be detrimental to persons,
property, or the general welfare because of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors.
   (b)   Minimum Size. Planned Unit Developments must be owned, leased, or
controlled by one person or single entity at the time of application and must
contain at least three (3) contiguous acres.
   (c)   Maximum Overall Density. The maximum overall residential density in a
PUD shall be equivalent to the maximum density that would otherwise be
permitted if the area proposed to be dedicated to residential land uses were
developed as a conventional subdivision.
      (1)   PUD Density shall be calculated by preparing a map of the units
yielded for a conventional subdivision on the parcel, or by use of the
following formula:
      (TSA/MLA) X 80%, where:
         (A)   TSA = the Total Site Area. TSA is determined by deducting the
following from the total project area:
            (i)   Any area devoted to non-residential purposes;
            (ii)   The area of land which may not be developed because it is
within a floodway, Category 3 wetland, existing water body, or land subject to
an existing conservation easement, but where floodways, wetlands, water bodies,
or land subject to an existing conservation easement overlap, they shall be
counted only once. The Planning Commission may reduce the total for the amount
of land which may not be developed by up to one-third (1/3) upon a finding the
developer will incorporate and provide an adequate mechanism for the
preservation of an equivalent area of these features in required yard setbacks.
         (B)   MLA = Minimum Lot Area (in acres). The minimum lot area factor
shall be the stated minimum lot area requirement in Section
1125.14(f) (Schedule of District Regulations) for the type of residential
development in the underlying Zoning District. To convert the minimum lot area
requirements in the Schedule from square feet to acres simply requires the
specified standard in square feet to be divided by 43,560 square feet per acre.
         (C)   80% = The factor to account for losses in land area due to
proposed new roads and the fact that some of the lots in a development will be
larger than the minimum required.
         (D)   When the above formula produces a fractional value for the total
number of units for the total project area, this final number shall be rounded
to the nearest whole number.
      (2)   When a residential use is proposed for a PUD in a commercial or
industrial underlying zoning district, the minimum lot area standard for the
residential area of the PUD shall be the minimum lot area requirement for R-
4 multiple-family dwellings in Section
1125.14(f) (Schedule of District Regulations).
   (d)   Flexible Development. Minimum required lot area, lot width, and yard
depth standards specified in Section
1125.14(f) (Schedule of District Regulations) may be reduced to accommodate a
variety of structural patterns, clustering designs, and housing types.
      (1)   The minimum spacing between any principal buildings, which are not
attached, shall be ten (10) feet.
      (2)   Planned Unit Developments must be developed so that any reduction
to minimum residential lot size provides required common open space at an
equivalent ratio. Where the sum of the area of all lots devoted to residential
use is less than the product of the number of dwellings and the minimum lot
area requirement for each type of dwelling pursuant to Section
1125.14(f) (Schedule of District Regulations), the difference in area shall be
required open space.
   (e)   Open Space. Planned Unit Developments must be designed so that all
common open space is preserved for its intended purpose as expressed in the
Final Development Plan.
      (1)   One or a combination of the following three methods shall be used
to administer the common open space:
         (A)   Public dedication to the City of the common open space.
         (B)   Establishment of an association or nonprofit corporation of all
individuals, corporations or other entities owning property within the Planned
Unit Development to insure the maintenance of all common open space.
         (C)   Retention of single ownership, control and maintenance of all
common open space.
      (2)   Planned Unit Developments must be established so that all privately
owned common open space shall continue to conform to its intended use and
remain as expressed in the Final Development Plan through the inclusion in all
deeds of appropriate restrictions to insure that the common open space is
permanently preserved according to the Final Development Plan. Such deed
restrictions shall run with the land and be for the benefit of the property
owners and shall contain a prohibition against partition.
      (3)   Planned Unit Developments must be designed so that all common open
space, as well as public and recreational facilities, shall be specifically
included in the development schedule and shall be constructed and fully
improved at an equivalent or greater rate than the construction of residential
structures. In addition, common open space shall be designed as a functional
part of the development, distributed throughout the area and accessible to all
residents. If administration of common open space is through an association or
nonprofit corporation, such organization shall conform to the following
requirements:
         (A)   The association or nonprofit corporation shall be established
prior to the sale of any lots.
         (B)   Membership in the association or nonprofit corporation shall be
mandatory for all residential property owners within the Planned Unit
Development.
         (C)   The association or nonprofit corporation shall manage all common
open space and recreational and cultural facilities that are not dedicated to
the public, provide for the maintenance, administration and operation of such
land and structures, and any other land within the Planned Unit Development not
publicly or privately owned, and shall secure adequate liability insurance on
the land and structures.
         (D)   If administration of common open space is through an association
or nonprofit corporation, the title to all residential property owners shall
include an undivided fee simple estate in all common open space.
   (f)   Essential Services. Planned Unit Developments shall be:
      (1)   Adequately served by essential public infrastructure, facilities,
and services, or provides at the applicant's expense for the construction of
additional public infrastructure, facilities, and/or services which would
adequately service such use;
      (2)   Located on a site with at least one property line abutting a major
or minor arterial street and designed so that all ingress and egress to the
off-street parking area for guests, employees and residents shall be directly
onto a major or minor arterial street.
      (3)   Designed so that utilities and streets in the Planned Unit
Development meet the Standards of Improvements as set forth in Section
1165.10 (Standards of Improvements).
   (g)   Off-street Parking, Loading and Storage Regulations. Off-street
parking, loading and storage regulations as set forth in Chapter
1141 shall apply to all uses established within the PUD Overlay District.
   (h)   Signs Permitted. Signs shall be permitted in the PUD Overlay District
in accordance with Chapter
1143.
   1127.14 COMBINED PRELIMINARY AND FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   It is intended that PUD development review will be a two-stage process,
first involving Preliminary Development Plan approval to include amendment to
the Zoning Map designating the parcel a PUD Overlay District, and then
involving Final Development Plan approval, which includes Subdivision
Preliminary Plat approval. Applicants are encouraged to separately submit
applications for approval of Preliminary Development Plans to the Planning
Commission for review before extensive engineering and formal submission of a
Final Development Plan as set forth in the following sections. At the
applicant's option, however, the applicant may proceed directly toward filing

   1127.17 AMENDMENTS (CHANGES) TO APPROVED PUD.
   After the approval of a Planned Unit Development, the developer, individual
property owners or property owner associations may wish to make major or minor
modifications. Inasmuch as approval of a Planned Unit Development, including a
final development plan, is based upon a unified plan, which stresses total
design integration, proposed modifications must be evaluated for their impact
on the visual and physical amenities of the development. In order to allow for
a process through which this assessment can be made, the following procedures
for modifications shall be followed:
   (a)   An application for an "Amendment to a Planned Unit Development" shall
be filed with the Building and Zoning Inspector. The application shall include
the required number of revised development plans clearly showing the proposed
changes. The application shall also contain, if applicable, a written
recommendation from a residential or commercial property owners association.
   (b)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall review the proposed
modifications and shall determine if the scope of the proposed changes is major
or minor in nature. To qualify as a minor modification, the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall find that proposed modification consists of only the following:
      (1)   Modification to lot lines that do not result in an increase to
density, dwelling units, or placement of a structure closer to the perimeter
lot line of the PUD.
      (2)   Installation of, or adjustments to, the size and location of
structures, accessory structures, swimming pools, patios and decorative fencing
(other than chain link), landscaping and other improvements that do not;
         (A)   Result in an increase in the approved number of housing units or
principal non-residential structures.
         (B)   Move or relocate a principal structure when the subject property
abuts land that is used for residential purposes inside or outside of the
development.
         (C)   Move or relocate a principal structure such that the placement
of structures will be closer to any property line than existed before such
relocation.
      (3)    Modifications to approved circulation drives and parking areas so
long as they do not reduce the number of approved spaces, or encroach into
setback areas or designated recreation/open space areas, and the location and
number of curb cuts remains unchanged.
      (4)    Reductions in the size of signs.
   (c)   The Building and Zoning Inspector may approve minor changes if all of
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The proposed minor change has received unconditional approval from
the appropriate property owners' association or nonprofit corporation, if such
exists. In the event that there is no property owners' association, the
Building and Zoning Inspector shall ensure that the proposed minor change meets
all other requirements of Part 11 - Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   The proposed minor change meets with the approval of applicable
City departments,
   (d)   A major change shall be construed as any change that does not satisfy
the above criteria for a minor change. All proposed major changes shall be
acted upon in the same manner and in accordance with the same procedures as an
original final development plan as specified in Section
1127.16.

   1127.19 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
      (a)   The purpose of the FT-O Overlay District is to promote and protect
the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare by
providing regulation for the development of properties in the vicinity of or
adjacent to the Fallen Timbers Battle site in the City of Maumee. The FT-
O Overlay District area is intended to protect this area of special and
substantial public interest because of the location of a national battlefield,
the site of the Battle of Fallen Timbers. This battlefield is a historic,
environmental, recreational, economic, and cultural resource of national
significance. As a National Park System Affiliate, this area will include the
Battle site, a visitor's center, natural areas, and recreational trails. It is
the general purpose and intent of these regulations to balance private property
rights and interests with the need to protect the Battlefield as a historical
and cultural attraction. It is also intended that this Overlay District will
balance ratios of retail and non-retail uses to minimize adverse fiscal
hardships and consequences to the City with respect to the public costs and
benefits related to providing public services and facilities.
   (b)   Within the FT-O Overlay District, supplemental buffering requirements
are defined to eliminate or minimize negative environmental impact, to improve
transportation coordination and capability, and to balance recreational,
commercial, and industrial land uses, while respecting the rights of property
owners to make beneficial use of their properties.
(Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   1127.20 EFFECT OF DISTRICT.
   The FT-O District has the effect of modifying the requirements, regulations,
permitted uses, and procedures applying in the underlying C-M Zoning District
after the FT-O designation is overlaid, pursuant to the following regulations
in this chapter.
(Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)   
   1127.21 FT-O OVERLAY DISTRICT ADDITIONS.
    All applications proposing additions to the FT-O Overlay District are
applications for amendment to the Zoning Map and shall be considered in
accordance with the procedures for rezoning. Designation of acreage to be added
to the FT-O Overlay District must also meet the following requirements:
      (a)    The application for the imposition of an FT-O Overlay District
must be signed by all owners of real estate in the area proposed for the
addition to the FT-O Overlay District.
   (b)   The acreage proposed for addition to the FT-O Overlay District must be
acreage within the City of Maumee which falls within the following boundaries:
      (1) Black Road on the west;
      (2) Anthony Wayne Trail on the south;
      (3) Norfolk and Southern railroad track on the north; and
      (4) North Jerome Road on the east.
   (c)   Upon approval of an FT-O Overlay District application, the District
Map shall be amended to designate the acreage as a FT-O Overlay District.
      (Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   
   1127.22  PERMITTED USES.
    All uses, which are permitted in the C-M Zoning District, are permitted
within the FT-O Overlay District. (Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   1127.23 CONDITIONAL USES.
     All uses which are specified as conditional uses within the C-M Commercial
Industrial Zoning District are permitted within the FT-O Overlay District.
(Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   1127.24 MULTI-FAMILY USES.
    A multiple-family dwelling constructed in the Fallen Timbers Overlay
district must meet the same requirements as a multiple-family dwelling unit
constructed in an R-4 zoning district including all requirements for multiple-
family dwellings contained in Chapters
1135,
1136,
1141, and
1145. Building and site design, materials and landscaping must be compatible
with surrounding structures and area and shall be approved at the discretion of
the City Administrator and/or Zoning Administrator. Multiple-family dwellings
must be part of a large development consisting of multiple buildings, building
designs, exterior materials, uses, and must be on lots greater than two (2)
acres in size and a minimum density for any multi-family development may be
imposed at the discretion of the City Administrator. One single-story building
may be permitted per development to accommodate a multi-use clubhouse facility.
All other buildings shall be a minimum of three (3) stories; however, at the
sole discretion of the Zoning Administrator (or designee) some two-story
buildings may be permitted. In making the determination to allow for two-story
buildings the Zoning Administrator shall take into consideration the
architectural features, streetscape, and how the development will blend with
the general environment of the FT-O Overlay District. Finished ceiling height
must be a minimum of ten (10) feet on the first floor and nine (9) foot in each
story above the first. The City Administrator shall have the sole discretion to
allow for shorter celling heights and in making his determination shall take
into consideration the overall development and its' impact on the FT-O Overlay
District area. The preference is for compatible office or commercial use of the
first floor of at least one structure along the primary street with residential
above the first floor. Dwellings may be on the first floor but first floor
construction must allow for easy conversion to accommodate the occupancy of
other C-M permitted uses. Any first floor occupancy other than residential must
be compatible with the residential use of the building and shall be approved at
the discretion of the Zoning Administrator (or designee). (Ord. 012-2022.
Passed 3-7-22.)
   1127.25 JEROME ROAD BUFFER ZONE.
      A buffer zone shall be established along the full length of the western
side of the North Jerome Road right-of-way, from the north boundary of the FT-
O Overlay District to the south boundary of the FT-O Overlay District, and
shall apply to any future expansion of the FT-O Overlay District made pursuant
to Section
1127.21.  This buffer zone shall be not less than thirty-five (35) feet in
depth, measured from the west right-of-way line of North Jerome Road to a point
parallel with such west right-of-way line. This buffer zone will remain
undeveloped, except for undulating earth mounding with natural landscaping
treatments consisting of a variety of trees, shrubs, other plant material, or
decorative natural treatments. Slopes of the undulating mound shall not exceed
one foot of height to three feet of horizontal distance, and shall achieve a
height of not less than three (3) feet above the grade of North Jerome Road. No
part of this buffer zone may be used for any of the following purposes:
     (a)    Vehicular Driveway or curb cut;
   (b)    Parking area (except those servicing park and recreational use of the
area);
   (c)    Signage;
   (d)    Exterior lighting which exceeds six (6) feet in height;
   (e)    Dumpsters or Dumpster enclosures;
   (f)    Outside storage.
      (Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   
   1127.26  DESIGNATED WOODLANDS.
      (a)    All areas within the FT-O Overlay District, which have been
designated as Woodlands pursuant to Section
966.141 of the Maumee Revised Code, shall be subject to all rules and
regulations of Chapters
966 and
1145.    
(Ord. 012-2022. Passed 3-7-22.)
   1127.27 AMENDMENTS.
   Any provision of this FT-O Overlay District may be amended in accordance
with the process and procedures prescribed in this Zoning Code for the
processing of a request for an amendment to the text of the Zoning Code.

CHAPTER 1130
Nonconforming Uses
1130.01   Nonconforming uses.
1130.02   Preexisting zoning use permits.
1130.03   Nonconforming land.
1130.04   Nonconforming structures.
1130.05   Nonconforming use of structures and land.
1130.06   Alterations of nonconforming uses.
1130.07   Vacant, abandoned or discontinued use.
1130.08   Nonconforming signs. (Repealed)
1130.09   Repairs, maintenance, alterations, or improvements.
   1130.01 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   The districts established by this Zoning Code constitute the proper
location for the permitted, conditional, and accessory uses and structures
identified herein. Within such districts there may exist nonconforming uses
that were lawful prior to the enactment of these regulations, but that would be
prohibited under the provisions of the current Zoning Code. Future amendments
to this Zoning Code may also create additional nonconforming uses.
   (b)   The legitimate interests of those lawfully established nonconforming
uses are recognized in this Zoning Code by allowing such nonconforming uses to
continue, subject to specific requirements for, and limitations upon, their
completion, restoration, alteration, perpetuation and/or substitution. It is
recognized that nonconforming uses substantially and adversely affect the
orderly development, maintenance, use and taxable value of other properties in
the district, property that is itself subject to the regulations of this Zoning
Code.
   (c)   In order to secure eventual compliance with the standards of this
Zoning Code it is necessary to strictly regulate nonconforming uses and to
prevent the reestablishment of nonconforming uses that have been discontinued.
   (d)   The following sections divide nonconforming uses into four categories
and provide appropriate regulations for each category:
      (1)   Preexisting Zoning Use Permits that no longer comply with the
requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Nonconforming land: lots, including vacant lots, having an area
smaller than the minimum size required under Section
1125.14.
      (3)   Nonconforming structures or use thereof: structures which do not
comply with the lot size or building bulk limitations required under Section
1125.14.
      (4)   Nonconforming uses of structures and land that do not comply with
the requirements of this Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)
   1130.02 PREEXISTING ZONING USE PERMITS.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction, size or designated use of a building, structure or part thereof
for which a Zoning Use Permit has been granted and the construction of which
according to such permit or plans and specifications shall have been started
prior to the enactment of this Zoning Code or such amendment. If any building
construction for which a building permit has been granted is discontinued for a
period of ninety (90) calendar days, any further construction shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code. Any non-conforming use
existing prior to November 01, 2020 shall still be considered non-conforming
and shall comply with the same perpetuation of use or structure code adherence
in place prior to November 01, 2020. The Zoning Administrator may revoke the
Zoning Use Permit and require a new site plan to be submitted showing
compliance with Chapter
1135 and require non-conformance be abated or corrected.
(Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)
   1130.03 NONCONFORMING LAND.
   (a)   In any district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Code, where an existing lot of record fails to meet the
requirements for area, width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, such lot may be used for the permitted uses of the zoning district,
including permitted accessory uses. However, all yard dimensions and other
requirements, not involving area or width of the lot, must conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
   
   (b)   If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots of record with
continuous frontage and in single ownership and use at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, irrespective of whether all or part of the lots
meets the chapter requirements, the lands involved will be considered to be an
undivided parcel. No portion of said parcel or lot can be used or sold that
does not meet lot, width, and area requirements, nor can any division of the
parcel or lot be made which leaves remaining any parcel or lot with a width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter. The Zoning Administrator
may require that some or all lots be combined into a single lot of record prior
to issuing a Zoning Use Permit for the properties.
   (c)   If a current permitted use contains improvements, including but not
limited to driveways, accessory structures, parking areas, etc. which extend
beyond a single lot, the Zoning Administrator may require that all improved
lots be combined into a single lot prior to issuing additional Zoning Use
Permits for the properties.
(Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)
   1130.04 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A lawfully existing structure which contains no nonconforming use, but which
does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, building bulk
regulations, or off-street parking requirements may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful. Such "nonconforming structures" shall be subject to
the following requirements:
   (a)   A nonconforming structure may be maintained and repaired. However, no
maintenanceor repair shall either create any additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such
structure; and damaged or destroyed structures shall be subject to the
restrictions in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   In the event that a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed,
by any means, to such an extent that the cost of restoring it to the condition
in which it was prior to such damage or destruction exceeds sixty percent (60%)
of the current assessed value of the entire structure, such structure shall not
be restored unless it thereafter conforms to the regulations for the district
in which it is located.
   (c)   No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part, for any
distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless
the entire structure thereafter conforms to the regulations of the district in
which it is located after being moved.
   (d)   The Zoning Administrator may, at their discretion, require the
elimination of all, or a portion of, any nonconformity as a condition of the
issuance of a Zoning Use Permit for the property.
      (Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)
   1130.05 NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   When the applicable district regulations of this Zoning Code do not allow as
a permitted use either a use of part or all of a structure lawfully existing at
the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code, or a use of land not involving a
structure lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Code,
such existing use may be continued so long as otherwise lawful. Such
"nonconforming uses" shall be subject to the following requirements:
   (a)   Work may be done on ordinary maintenance and repairs, or on repair of
walls, minor electrical fixtures, wiring, minor plumbing or minor mechanical.
However, this paragraph shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of this
section or to in any way perpetuate the future existence of the nonconformance
of use, structure, or land.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to allow the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of a structure, other than a damaged or destroyed
structure subject to the provisions of Section
1130.06 (b) hereof, in accordance with the order of a public official who is
charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be
unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition.
   (c)   Nonconforming residential structures in a business or industrial
district may be maintained and repaired. However, no increase in the number of
dwelling units shall be permitted.
      (Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)
   1130.06 ALTERATIONS OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   No structural alteration shall be made unless the entire structure and the
use of such structure thereafter conforms to the regulations of the district in
which such structure is located, except as provided herein.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a nonconforming structure to be
repaired subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A nonconforming structure may be repaired, provided the structure
is not enlarged or extended and the non-conformance is not increased or
perpetuated.
      (2)   A nonconforming use of land may not be extended, enlarged or
increased in intensity.
      (3)   Any existing nonconforming use which adds the sale of beer and/or
alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, or, if the existing
nonconforming use includes the sale of beer and/or alcoholic beverages for
consumption on the premises, and a change would include a later closing hour
and/or the sale of beer or alcoholic beverages with the greater alcoholic
content than the existing nonconforming use, it shall be deemed to extend,
enlarge or increase in intensity such existing nonconforming use.
   (b)   In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to
a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to such an extent
that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before such
damage or destruction exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the current assessed value
of the entire structure, exclusive of foundation, such structure shall not be
restored unless such structure and the use thereof thereafter conforms to the
regulations of the district in which it is located. Moreover, even if such
damage is sixty percent (60%) or less, no repair or restoration shall be made
unless a Building Permit and Zoning Use Permit are obtained, and restoration is
actually begun, within six months after the date of such partial destruction
and is diligently pursued to completion. In the event of a work stoppage of
more than thirty (30) days, the Zoning Administrator may, at their discretion,
revoke the Zoning Use permit and require that the structure and use thereafter
conforms to the regulation of the district in which it is located.
   (c)   No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatever, to any other
location on the same lot or any other lot unless the entire structure and the
use thereof thereafter conforms to the regulations of the district in which it
is located after being so moved. Moreover, no nonconforming use of land shall
be moved, in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location
on the same or any other lot unless such use thereafter conforms to the
regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved.
   (d)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have no authority to allow a
nonconforming use to be re-established once it has become vacant, abandoned or
a discontinued use under Section
1130.07 and no nonconforming accessory use shall continue after the principal
use to which it is accessory has been discontinued.
   (e)   The Zoning Administrator may, at their discretion, require the
elimination of all, or a portion of, any nonconforming issues as a condition of
the issuance of a Zoning Use Permit for the property. (Ord. 113-2020. Passed
12-21-20.)
   1130.07 VACANT, ABANDONED OR DISCONTINUED USE.
    (a)    Residential Structure. The structure may not continue in its current
form without complying with all requirements of this Part 11 if it is
considered vacant, abandoned, or the use has been discontinued for more than
six (6) consecutive months by the Chief Building Official, Zoning
Administrator, and City Administrator. Also, should the same individuals
determine that the structure's condition requires complete replacement, the
structure will lose its legal non-conforming status, and conformance will be
required. Any subsequent use of the building referred to in this section shall
also conform to the requirements of this Part 11.
(Ord. 005-2025. Passed 3-3-25.)
   (b)   Commercial Structure. The structure may not continue in its current
form without complying with all requirements of this Part 11 if it is
considered vacant, abandoned, or the use has been discontinued for more than
nine (9) consecutive months by the Chief Building Official, Zoning
Administrator, and City Administrator. Also, should the same individuals
determine that the structure's condition requires complete replacement, the
structure will lose its legal non-conforming status, and conformance will be
required. Any subsequent use of the building referred to in this section shall
also conform to the requirements of this Part 11.
   (c)   Industrial Structure. The structure may not continue in its current
form without complying with all requirements of this Part 11 if it is
considered vacant, abandoned, or the use has been discontinued for more than
nine (9) consecutive months by the Chief Building Official, Zoning
Administrator, and City Administrator. Also, should the same individuals
determine that the structure's condition requires complete replacement, the
structure will lose its legal non-conforming status, and conformance will be
required. Any subsequent use of the building referred to in this section shall
also conform to the requirements of this Part 11.
   (d)   Determination of Abandonment, Discontinuance and Vacancy.
Nonconforming lots, nonconforming buildings and structures, nonconforming uses
of buildings and structures, and nonconforming uses of land will be considered
abandoned, discontinued, or vacant if one (1) or more of the following
conditions exists, and will be deemed to constitute intent on the part of the
property owner to abandon, discontinue or vacate:
      (1)   Utilities, such as water, gas or electricity to the property, have
been disconnected;
      (2)   The property, buildings, or grounds, have fallen into disrepair
thus requiring full replacement;
      (3)   Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming
use have been removed;
      (4)   Equipment or fixtures that are necessary for the operation of the
nonconforming use have been removed; or
      (5)   Other actions, which in the opinion of the Chief Building Official,
Zoning Administrator, and City Administrator constitute an intention on the
part of the property owner or lessee to abandon the nonconforming use.
         (Ord. 113-2020. Passed 12-21-20.)

work is limited to ordinary repair/maintenance, or repair or replacement of
non-bearing walls, minor electrical fixtures, wiring, minor plumbing or minor
mechanical and requires the approval of the Chief Building Official, Zoning
Administrator, and City Administrator, provided that:
      (1)   The dimensional characteristics of the building as it existed at
the time of passage or amendment of this chapter is not increased. This does
not allow for the separation or expansion of utility systems for nonconforming
residential uses; and
      (2)   The building, structure or use has not lost its nonconforming
status due to vacancy, discontinuance or abandonment.
   (b)   Commercial or Industrial Use: Repairs, maintenance, alterations or
improvements totaling less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the assessed
value of the building may be completed on any building or structure that is
determined to be devoted to a nonconforming use or is itself a nonconforming

the time of passage or amendment of this chapter is not increased. This does
not allow for the separation or expansion of utility systems for nonconforming
commercial or industrial uses; and
      (2)   The building, structure or use has not lost its nonconforming
status due to vacancy, discontinuance or abandonment.
   (c)   Residential Use: Repairs or maintenance totaling greater than fifty
(50%) percent of the assessed value of the building may be completed for any
reason and on any nonconforming structure or structure devoted to a
nonconforming use. However, such repairs or maintenance will be permitted only
in conformity with the provisions of the chapter. If deemed unfeasible and/or
impractical, a property owner may seek a variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals (see Chapter
1105), assuming it can also be demonstrated that the original structure was
consistent with the established character of the area.
   (d)   Commercial or Industrial Use: Repairs or maintenance totaling greater
than seventy-five percent (75%) of the assessed value of the building may be
completed for any reason and on any nonconforming structure or structure
devoted to a nonconforming use However, such repairs or maintenance will be
permitted only in conformity with the provisions of the chapter. However, when
deemed unfeasible and/or impractical, a property owner may seek a variance from
the Board of Zoning Appeals (see Chapter
1105), assuming it can also be demonstrated that the original structure was
consistent with the established character of the area.
   (e)   Nonconforming Landscaping and Screening. Landscaping and screening
must be brought into conformance with the requirements of Chapter
1145, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator and City Administrator,
whenever:
       (1)   The projected cost of repairs, maintenance, alterations or
improvements exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the assessed value of the

      (4)   The residential use of the building has been vacant, abandoned or
discontinued for more than three (3) consecutive months;
       (5)   The commercial use of the building has been vacant, abandoned or
discontinued for more than three (3) consecutive months;
      (6)   The industrial use of the building has been vacant, abandoned or
discontinued for more than three (3) consecutive months.
       The continuation of substandard landscaping and screening must be
considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals through the variance process
established under Chapter
1105.
   (f)   Assessed Value. For the purposes of enforcing the regulations
contained in this section, the value of the structure will be determined by the
most recent valuation of the structure for the purposes of taxation.
    (g)   Ordinary Repair/maintenance. Nothing in this section prevents
ordinary repair/maintenance, or the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any structure or part thereof deemed to be unsafe by an official
charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
   (h)   Unsafe or Unlawful Structure. A nonconforming structure, or portion of
a structure, or a structure containing a nonconforming use that is physically
unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, as determined by the
Chief Building Official and Zoning Administrator, shall not be restored unless
such structure and the use thereof thereafter conforms to the regulations of
the district in which it is located.

   The site plan review procedures and standards set forth herein provide a
consistent and uniform method of review of proposed development plans, to
ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this chapter, other
applicable chapters of this Code, standard engineering practices, and county,
state, and federal rules and laws. The procedures set forth herein are further
intended to:
   (a)   Achieve efficient use of the land;
   (b)   Protect the traditional character of the City;
   (c)   Minimize adverse impacts on adjoining or nearby properties;
   (d)   Address traffic and pedestrian circulation.
   (e)   Provide a mechanism for review of new development and redevelopment or
reuse of existing site to ensure compliance with current standards; and
   (f)   Encourage cooperation and consultation between the City and the
applicant to facilitate development in accordance with the City's land use
objectives.
      (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1135.02 PROJECTS REQUIRING SITE PLAN REVIEW.
    Prior to the creation of a use, erection of a building, and those
conditions cited below, a site plan or administrative plan must be submitted
for approval, in accordance with this section. The extent of review for various
types of projects is classified into three (3) types generally described below.
The table of required review process provides a specific listing of review
classifications:
   (a)   Planning commission review (PCR). Most new development, major, mid-
size expansions will require a full site plan (FSP) under Section
1135.04, full site plan submittal and review procedures.
    (b)   Administrative review (AR). Select projects and expansions or changes
in use to existing sites will undergo a less formal review and approval process
by the Zoning Administrator, City Administrator (or designee), and any others
deemed necessary. The Zoning Administrator always reserves the right to send
any administratively reviewed plans to the Planning Commission for final
determination, especially when it relates to aesthetics and architecture.
      (1)   Full site plan (FSP). Select medium and small scale projects and
expansions, or changes in use to existing sites, are permitted to provide less
detailed information than a comprehensive site plan (CSP). The level of
information is intended to be proportionate to the extent of the change and yet
insure adequate review for compliance with applicable requirements. It is also
intended to alleviate the expansion and perpetuation of non-conforming uses,
landscaping, and/or structures,
      (2)   Plot site plan (PSP). Select projects, such as one-family and two-
family dwellings on an individual lot, only require the submission of a plot
plan (PP) given their relatively low level of impact on adjacent land uses, and
given that compliance with applicable zoning regulations can be addressed
during the building permit review process. Other applicable approvals are still
required such as zoning compliance permits, building permits and inspections.

   1135.03 SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS FROM SITE PLAN REVIEW CHAPTER.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to:
   (a)   The construction or alteration of any structure used exclusively for
agriculture, horticulture, or floriculture, that does not involve retail sales
and that is not within or abutting a single family residential zoning district.
      (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1135.04 SITE PLAN SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Full Site Plan (FSP) Submittal and Review Procedures for Planning
Commission Review (PCR). When a full site plan (FSP) is required for planning
commission review (PCR), the following procedure will apply, unless otherwise
noted in the table of required review process.
      (1)   Pre-application Meeting. For the purposes of identifying major
issues related to a project and to discuss questions related to this chapter
and other chapters of this Code, the applicant must attend a pre-application
meeting with the Zoning Administrator (or designee), and any others deemed
necessary. Sufficient information must be submitted prior to the meeting that
describes the proposed project. Discussion at this meeting is in no way a
formal approval or decision on any aspect of a proposed project.
      (2)   Application. Any person with legal interest in a lot or parcel may
apply for planning commission review (PCR) of a full site plan (FSP) by filing
a completed application form, paying the review fee and providing digital
(electronic) and hard copies (size and number to be determined by the Zoning
Administrator (or designee)) of the FSP, according to the submittal schedule
prepared by the Zoning Administrator at the beginning of every calendar year.
Required site plan contents are listed in Section
1135.05.
      (3)   Final Approval of a Full Site Plan (FSP). A full site plan
requiring approval by the planning commission must complete the following
process:
         A.   Planning commission approval. The Planning Commission and
appropriate city staff will review the full site plan (FSP) for compliance with
the standards of this chapter and other appropriate chapters of this Code and
statutes. Based upon this review the Planning Commission may either:
            1.   Approve the FSP.
            2.   Approve the FSP with conditions which the Planning Commission
determines are reasonable and necessary to ensure conformance with applicable
chapters of this Code and statutes. These conditions must be listed in the
motion and noted on the FSP, with the Planning Commission chairperson's
signature.
            3.   Table the FSP upon determining that it does not meet the
standards, spirit and intent of this chapter and other appropriate chapters of
this Code and statutes. The Planning Commission will direct the applicant to
make modifications and resubmit the FSP. The applicant will be required to
prepare a revised FSP, accompanied by a complete list of all changes with a
certification (by the applicant or his/her design professional), that no other
changes have been made.
            4.   Deny the FSP upon determining that it does not meet the
standards, spirit and intent of this chapter and other appropriate chapters of
this Code and statutes.
         B.   Implementation of planning commission approval. The following
provisions apply to a full site plan (FSP) which has received the approval of
the Planning Commission but not the administrative approval required by
subsection (a)(5) of this Section:
            1.   The adopted minutes of the planning commission, and the report
of the Zoning Administrator (or designee), will serve as the official record of
the Planning Commission's decision on a full site plan (FSP), including any
conditions of approval. The applicant will be responsible for obtaining a copy
of the adopted minutes, and submittal of a revised FSP and related documents
which demonstrate compliance with any conditions to the Zoning Administrator
(or designee). Any question on the decision may be made in writing to the
planning commission prior to the adoption of the minutes.
            2.   Upon receipt of approval of the full site plan (FSP) by the
Planning Commission, the applicant will have up to six (6) months to submit a
final FSP to the Zoning Administrator (or designee). However, the Zoning
Administrator may grant a single one time extension of up to one (1) additional
six (6) month period provided the request is received in writing prior to the
expiration date and presents reasonable evidence to the effect that the
development has encountered unforeseen non-self-created difficulties. Should
neither of the aforementioned provisions be fulfilled, or an extension has
expired without construction activity underway, the FSP will be considered null
and void.
            3.    Full site plan (FSP) approval by the Planning Commission does
not preclude the Zoning Administrator (or designee) from enforcing the
standards of this Chapter and other appropriate Chapters of this Code and
statutes, as well as the City's engineering standards. In all cases other city
standards may change the final site plan and development.
         C.   Administrative approval. Upon the receipt of application of the
full and other site plan (FSP) by the developer, architect and/or applicant,
the Zoning Administrator (or designee) will review the (FSP) for compliance
with the standards of this chapter and other appropriate chapters of this Code
and statutes, as well as the city's engineering standards. Based upon this
review the Zoning Administrator (or designee) may either:
            1.   Approve the FSP;
            2.    Refer the FSP back to the applicant or his/her design
professional for revision because it does not meet the standards, spirit and/or
intent of this chapter, other appropriate chapters of this Code and statutes,
or the city's engineering standards. The applicant or his/her design
professional will be required to prepare a revised FSP, accompanied by a
complete list of all changes and certification that no other changes have been
made; or
            3.    Deny the FSP upon determining that the plans do not meet the
standards, spirit and/or intent of this chapter, other appropriate chapters or
this Code and statutes, or the City's engineering standards.
      (4)    Following approval of the FSP, a digital (electronic) in dwg. and
pdf format file determined sufficient by the Zoning Administrator (or designee)
must be provided to the city on disk or via email by the applicant.
      (5)   A zoning compliance permit will also be required following approval
of the final FSP and the final site inspection by the Zoning Administrator, but
prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
      (6)   Changes to a full site plan (FSP) that has received final approval.
The holder of a FSP that has received final approval shall submit an
application for an "Amendment to an Approved Site Plan" to the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) for any proposed change to an approved Site Plan.
The fee for each application shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator
based upon the complexity of the proposed changes and the cost incurred by the
City in reviewing the proposed changes, but in no case shall the fee exceed the
cost of the original application fee. The application shall include two copies
and a digital file of the revised site plan clearly showing the proposed
changes to the approved Site Plan, and documentation outlying conditions
necessitating the changes. Changes to the approved site plan will be permitted
only under the following circumstances. In all instances the City Administrator
or Zoning Administrator must approve before changes can be implemented:
         A.   Minor amendments. Minor changes may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) upon determining that the proposed revisions(s)
will not alter the basic design nor any specific conditions imposed as part of
the FSP as originally approved. Minor changes may include the following:
            1.   Change in the building size of up to thirty-five percent (35%)
in total floor area in the event of no impact to other site improvements;
            2.    Movement of buildings or other structures by not more than
fifty (50) feet;
            3.    Replacement of plant material specified in the landscape plan
with comparable materials of an equal or greater size;
            4.    Changes in building materials to a comparable or higher
quality;
            5.    Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of
the use; and
            6.    Changes required by outside agencies such as county, state or
federal departments.
         B.   Major amendments. A proposed change not determined by the City
Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning Administrator, to be minor
must be submitted to the Planning Commission as a site plan amendment and will
be reviewed in the same manner as the original application.
            The City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning
Administrator, is the only city official who can approve a change to a full
site plan (FSP) that has received the approval of the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Performance guarantee. The City may require a performance
guarantee, as authorized by Section
1145.08, to assure the completion of any improvements shown on the site plan.
For the purposes of this section, improvements subject to performance
guarantees must include features and actions associated with a project that are
considered necessary by the city to protect the natural resources or the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city and future users or
inhabitants of the proposed project or project area, including roadways,
lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening and drainage.
      (8)   Administrative submittal and review procedures. Those applications
that qualify for administrative review in accordance with the table of required
review process must comply with the following procedure:
         A.   Pre-application meeting. For the purposes of identifying major
issues related to a project and to discuss questions related to this chapter
and other chapters of this Code, the applicant is encouraged to attend a pre-
application meeting with the Zoning Administrator (or designee), and any others
deemed necessary. Sufficient information must be submitted prior to the meeting
that describes the proposed project. Discussion at this meeting is in no way a
formal approval or decision on any aspect of a proposed project.
         B.   Application. Any person with legal interest in a lot or parcel
that qualifies for administrative review under the criteria set forth in
subsection (a) of this section may apply by filing a completed application
form, paying a review fee, providing a digital (electronic) file determined by
the Zoning Administrator (or designee), and hard copies (size and number to be
determined by the Zoning Administrator (or designee)) of the full site plan
(FSP) or plot site plan (PSP) with the Zoning Administrator (or designee).
Required plan contents are listed in Section
1135.05.
         C.   Approval. Upon review of the application, the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) will either:
            1.   Request specific revisions and re-submittal of the application
upon a finding the application does not meet information requirements or does
not meet the intent and regulations of this chapter;
            2.   Approve the administrative plan, with or without conditions;
or
            3.    Upon determining that the administrative plan does not meet
the standards, spirit and intent of this chapter and other appropriate chapters
of this Code and statutes, deny the administrative plan.
         D.   Effectiveness. Upon administrative plan approval, each project
must be under construction within six (6) months after the date of final
approval by the Zoning Administrator and be diligently carried on towards
completion. If the applicant does not fulfill this provision, the Zoning
Administrator may grant one six (6) month extension provided the applicant
makes application in writing prior to the expiration date and presents
reasonable evidence to the effect that the development has encountered non
self-created unforeseen difficulties but is then ready to proceed. Should
neither of the aforementioned provisions be fulfilled or the one-year extension
has expired without construction activity underway, the administrative plan
will be considered null and void.
         E.   Changes to the approved administrative plan. The holder of an
approved administrative plan shall submit an application for an "Amendment to
an Approved Site Plan" to the Zoning Administrator (or designee) for any
proposed change to an approved Site Plan. The fee for each application shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator based upon the complexity of the
proposed changes and the cost incurred by the City in reviewing the proposed
changes, but in no case shall the fee exceed the cost of the original
application fee. The application shall include two copies and a digital file of
the revised site plan clearly showing the proposed changes to the approved Site
Plan, and documentation outlying conditions necessitating the changes. The
Zoning Administrator (or designee) has the authority to review and approve any
changes, per subsection (a)(3) of this Section.
         F.   Performance guarantee. The City may require a performance
guarantee, as authorized by Section
1145.08, to assure the completion of any improvements shown on the site plan.
For the purposes of this section, improvements subject to performance
guarantees must include features and actions associated with a project that are
considered necessary by the City to protect the natural resources or the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City and future users or
inhabitants of the proposed project or project area, including roadways,
lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening and drainage.

(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1135.06 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW.
   (a)    Site Plan Review Criteria. In the process of reviewing a site plan,
the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator (or designee) must consider the
following criteria and assure that these conditions are met to the extent
practicable:
      (1)   Adequacy of information. The site plan must include all required
information in sufficiently complete and understandable form to provide an
accurate description of the proposed uses(s) and structures;
      (2)   Uses. The site plan must state that all proposed uses are permitted
in the zoning district in which the site is located;
      (3)    Site design characteristics. All elements of site design must be
harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to topography, the size and
type of lot, the character of adjoining property, and the type and size of
buildings. The site must be developed so as not to impede the normal and
orderly development or improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted
by this chapter. The site must be designed to conform to all provisions of this
chapter. Redevelopment of existing sites must be brought into conformance with
all site improvement provisions of this chapter which are relative to and
proportionate to the extent of redevelopment, as determined by the Planning
Commission or Zoning Administrator (or designee);
      (4)   Traditional city character/historic preservation. The City of
Maumee is a traditional community with many historic characteristics and
features. All site plans within the city must demonstrate that they are in
keeping with the character and history of the surrounding residential,
commercial, industrial, or mixed-use neighborhood;
      (5)   Buildings. Buildings and structures shall be designed so as to
limit front yard setbacks and allow for rear yard parking at the discretion of
the Zoning Administrator and will meet or exceed setback standards, height and
other dimensional standards, and be consistent with applicable building design
standards;
      (6)   Emergency vehicle access. All buildings or groups of buildings must
be arranged so as to permit emergency vehicle access by some practicable means
to all vehicles;
      (7)   Ingress and egress. Every structure or dwelling unit must be
provided with adequate means of ingress and egress via public streets, private
roads and walkways;
      (8)   Pedestrian and vehicular orientation. The site plan must provide a
system for pedestrian circulation that allows pedestrians to safely access the
site, circulate within the site, and access adjacent sites and development
areas such as neighborhoods. The arrangement of vehicular and pedestrian
circulation must respect the pattern of existing or planned streets and
pedestrian or bicycle pathways in the city. The width of streets and drives
must be appropriate for the volume of traffic they will carry;
      (9)   Drainage. Storm water management system and facilities must
preserve the natural drainage characteristics and enhance the aesthetics of the
site to the maximum extent possible. Measures must be taken to ensure storm
water management techniques follow safe practices to slow and treat drainage
before it enters the system and/or leaves the site;
      (10)   Soil erosion. The proposed development must include measures to
prevent soil erosion and sedimentation;
      (11)   Exterior lighting. Exterior lighting must be designed so that it
is aimed downward and deflected away from adjacent properties and so that it
does not impede the vision of drivers on public streets, adversely impact
abutting properties or adversely impact the natural evening sky. Foot candles
and lumen maximums, as published by the Dark Sky Society shall be adhered to as
closely as possible. Lighting levels may not exceed half (0.5) a foot-candle
beyond any perimeter (exterior) lot line for commercial or industrial and .05
for residential areas;
      (12)   Preservation of natural areas. The landscape must be preserved in
its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal,
alteration to the natural drainage courses, and the amount of cutting, filling
and grading. Insofar as practical, natural features and the site topography,
viewsheds, historical markers and environmental areas must be incorporated into
the proposed site design;
      (13)   Public services. The scale and design of the proposed development
must facilitate the adequate provision of services currently furnished by or
that may be required of the city or other public agency including, but not
limited to, fire and police protection, storm water management, sanitary sewage
removal and treatment, traffic control and administrative services. All new
utilities, public or otherwise, must be installed underground;
      (14)   Traffic impact. The expected volume of traffic to be generated by
the proposed use cannot adversely impact existing roads and the circulation
thereon. Driveways must be located to minimize conflict with traffic operations
on the adjoining road. The number of driveways must be the minimum needed to
provide reasonable access to the site;
         (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1135.07 SITE PLAN APPROVAL EXPIRATION.
   Site plan approval issued under this section shall lapse within one (1) year
unless a certificate of occupancy has been issued. When a Site Plan becomes the
subject of litigation, this one (1) year time limit shall be tolled until the
action of a court determining the merits of the legal action has become final
and the time limit for appeal has expired with no notice of appeal being taken.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1135.08 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.
   A development agreement signed by the applicant/developer/owner and the City
of Maumee is required prior to the issuance of a permit to memorialize all Site
Plan, Zoning Code and Building Code requirements. Upon consultation with the
City Law Director and the Zoning Administrator, the City Administrator has the
authority to sign the development agreement as surety for the completion of all
Site Plan, Zoning Code and Building Code requirements. The development
agreement shall include, but is not limited to, timelines for planning and
construction, building elevation, plans, city incentives, and surety.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1135.09 CONFLICTS
   When there is a conflict between Chapter
1135 and another part, chapter or section of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Maumee, the City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning
Administrator, shall determine which part, chapter or section shall be
applicable.

CHAPTER 1136
Design Standards
1136.01   Purpose and design standards.
1136.02   Applicability.
1136.03   Procedures/related approvals for non-CM Zoning Districts.
1136.04   Procedures/related approvals for CM Zoning Districts.
1136.05   Exterior wall standards.
1136.06   Roof design standards for all structures.
1136.07   Fenestration requirements for all new buildings, and where practical
in rehabbed building in the R-4, C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 Districts.
1136.08   Parking lots and site standards.
1136.09   Pedestrian circulation.
1136.10   Landscaping and screening.
1136.11   Building design accent standards.
1136.12   Building design standards for one-family and two-family dwelling
units.
1136.13   Lighting standards.
1136.14   Conflict.
   1136.01 PURPOSE OF DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   These standards are intended to promote the design of an urban
environment that is built to human scale, encourage attractive street fronts,
and accommodate pedestrians in a safe manner as recognized in a "Complete
Streets and Walkable Communities" platform while also accommodating vehicular
movement. It is desirable that there be a base level of quality architecture of
scale, color and materials that will allow a project to blend into its setting
and build upon the existing aesthetic identity of an area. Building shapes can
be articulated to provide a sense of human scale at the ground level that is
inviting to the public through the application of horizontal and vertical
patterns expressed by architectural features such as cornices, columns,
windows, doors or variations in massing.
   (b)   The intent of building design standards is to ensure a base level of
quality architecture that is responsive to its context and contributes to the
established architectural character of an area rather than a design solution
that is based on a standardized formula or market prototype superimposed on the
selected site. Not all structures in the surrounding area contribute equally to
the area character and each example shall be weighed against the balance of all
other projects. In areas with little, no or poor immediate context, or under
redevelopment, proposals should add to area character without rigid uniformity
of design.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.02 APPLICABILITY.
   All uses except one-family and two-family residential must comply with the
design standards of Sections
1136.05 and
1136.07 of this Chapter under the following circumstances;
   (a)    New Buildings. All uses, except one-family and two-family
residential, that receive site plan approval for construction of a new building
after the effective date of this section must fully comply with its design
standards. Refer to Section
1136.12 of this Chapter for building design standards for one-family and two-
family dwellings.
   (b)   Expansions and Major Improvements to Buildings. For buildings existing
prior to the effective date of this section, building changes, improvements,
and/or expansions which costs exceed fifty percent (50%) of the assessed value
of the building as set by the Lucas County Auditor may be permitted by the
Zoning Administrator (or designee) without the complete upgrade to meet the
standards of this section, provided they are reasonable in relation to the
scale and construction cost of the building improvements or expansion and they
do not increase or perpetuate a legal non-conformity with the requirements of
this section. Major exterior renovations must be consistent with the building
design standards herein to the extent deemed practical.
   (c)   Minor Improvements to Buildings. For buildings existing prior to the
effective date of this Section, minor changes, improvements, and modifications
may be approved administratively provided the improvements do not increase the
nonconformity with the requirements of this any section of the City of Maumee
municipal code or Zoning Ordinance. Any improvement in which the total cost
does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the assessed value of the building
as set by the Lucas County Auditor shall be considered a minor improvement. In
either case the Zoning Administrator may require compliance with current
standards.
   (d)   All structures within the C-3, Uptown Commercial District.
      (1)   Change of use. Any change of use within an existing structure in
the C-3 Zoning District shall be subject to the fenestration requirements of
this section and the exterior wall design standards specific to materials.
Additionally, to the greatest extent practical as determined by the Zoning
Administrator (or designee), all structures shall use historically accurate
restoration as approved by the Zoning Administrator and/or via original
photographs. All other provisions of this section shall be at the discretion of
the Zoning Administrator subject to section
1105.03; and/or
      (2)   Interior and/or exterior modifications to a legal nonconforming
structure. Any interior or exterior modifications to a legal nonconforming
structure within the C-3 Zoning District may be subject to the same provisions
as those noted for a change of use. This determination shall be at the
discretion of the Zoning Administrator (or designee); and/or
      (3)   Applicability if no longer deemed a legal nonconforming structure.
For purposes of this section, a legal nonconforming structure within the C-
3 Zoning District shall consist of any structure within which a use does not
cease for a period of less than three (3) months or does not remain vacant for
more than six (6) months. If the use ceases for greater than three (3) months,
the structure will be subject to all of the design standards outlined in
Sections
1136.05,
1136.06, and
1136.07 of this Chapter.
   (e)   Modification of Standards. The Zoning Administrator (or designee) will
perform an independent site review analysis and may allow the applicant to
deviate from zoning regulations if unique or restrictive circumstances exist.
      (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1136.03 PROCEDURES/RELATED APPROVALS FOR NON-CM ZONING DISTRICTS.
   In all zoning districts other than C-M, an applicant for Site Plan approval
shall file with the Site Plan, all supporting documentation and such additional
information as is necessary to determine compliance with the applicable Design
Standards and landscape requirements of this Chapter. Such additional
information shall include:
   (a)   Illustrations of all elevations of all structures, walls, fences, and
accessory structures;
   (b)   Color boards or samples for all exterior colors;
   (c)   Samples of all exterior materials;
   (d)   Drawings or photographs of all exterior illumination;
   (e)   Landscape plans; and
   (f)   Any other information necessary to determine compliance with this
Chapter.
      (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1136.04 PROCEDURES/RELATED APPROVALS FOR CM ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Within C-M Zoning Districts, an applicant for Site Plan approval shall,
prior to the filing of a Site Plan with the Zoning Administrator, apply for and
receive building preliminary, general architectural approval from the
applicable C-M Architectural Committee. Proof of approval and a copy of the
approved architectural plans shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator
concurrently with the Site Plan and supporting documentation. Approval by a C-
M Architectural Committee which has applied standards meeting or exceeding the
minimum requirements of this Code shall constitute compliance with design
standards requirements.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.05 EXTERIOR WALL STANDARDS.
   (a)    Colors. Information on building colors must be submitted with the
site plan and considered to be part of any Site Plan approval under Chapter
1135. Colors must be architecturally compatible with the surrounding area and
as agreed to by the City Administrator and Zoning Administrator (or designee).
   (b)   Wall Materials. The use of exterior wall materials on walls (including
those on accessory structures) that are visible from a public road, alley, or a
parking lot must be incompliance with the maximum percentages permitted in the
"Table of Acceptable Exterior Wall Materials," unless otherwise provided per
the footnotes on subsections (c)(2) through (5) of this section and must also
demonstrate Architectural compatibility with both all structures on the
property and those in the surrounding neighborhood.

Footnotes to the Table of Acceptable [Exterior] Wall Materials.
(1)    Does not include facade areas consisting of doors and windows.
(2)   All walls exposed to public view from a public street, alley or an
adjacent residential area must be constructed of not less than seventy-five
percent (75%) brick, face brick, stone or cast stone.
(3)   Includes flat sheets and seamed or ribbed panels, including aluminum,
porcelain and stainless steel and similar material. Such materials cannot be
used where contact with vehicles may occur, such as parking areas, traffic
ways, and loading areas, unless such walls are adequately protected to prevent
damage.
(4)   Includes fiberglass, reinforced decorative stamped, colored concrete,
polymer plastic (fypon), exterior insulation and finishing systems (EIFS),
plaster, stucco and similar materials. The Zoning Administrator (or designee)
may increase the percentage of wall that can be clad in finishes if they are
designed to mimic the appearance of another approved finish (e.g., EIFS
designed to look like cut stone) or other embellishments are added to the
building facade (e.g., window and door trim, cornices, etc.), per the criteria
set forth in subsection (c)(4) of this section. Such materials cannot be used
where contact with vehicles may occur, such as parking areas, traffic ways, and
loading areas, unless such walls are adequately protected to prevent damage.
   (a)   Material used in the C-3 district shall match the historical
characteristic of the district.
(5)   Cast stone, including lightweight artificial stone products, must
complement other materials found in the surrounding area and be approved by the
and Zoning Administrator (or designee) upon the review of building facade
elevations submitted by the applicant.
(6)   A maximum coverage of fifty (50) percent burnished concrete block is
permitted in the C-4, M-1, and M-2 districts only upon special approval from
the Zoning Administrator (or designee) where the applicant demonstrates special
conditions that limit use of other materials and demonstration that other site
and building design enhancements are provided. The height limit for burnished
concrete block is six (6) feet.
(7)   Parking structures may use precast concrete or concrete formed in place
if approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) upon the review of
building facade elevations submitted by the applicant.
(8)   Decorative metal and other embellishments may be used if approved by the
Zoning Administrator (or designee) upon the review of building facade
elevations submitted by the applicant.
(9)   Must be clapboard, cedar shingles, or similar materials approved by the
Zoning Administrator (or designee) upon the review of building façade
elevations submitted by the applicant. Any grade of plywood, oriented strand
board (OSB), T-111 siding, and similar materials are strictly prohibited on any
portion of a structure because they are not finished building materials and do
not under any circumstances weather like the other reference exterior/wall
materials.
(10)   The exterior wall of the office area of an industrial structure shall
consist of any mixture of material permitted in the C-4 zoning district or
other materials approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee).
(11)   The preferred product is a cementus material.
(12)   Siding may not protrude beyond a window or door casing except under
special circumstances which shall be approved at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator.
   (c)   Allowance for Other Materials. The Zoning Administrator (or designee)
may waive strict compliance with the subsection (b) of this Section when the
qualities listed below can be demonstrated. Review and consultation by the
appropriate design professional is encouraged before a final determination is
made. The proposed building design and materials schedule must be accompanied
by a written design statement which describes how the selected wall materials
and material combinations will be consistent with and enhance the building
design.
      (1)   The design and materials are found to be in keeping with the
character and history of the neighborhood or other area of the city;
      (2)   The materials are found to be permanent and durable;
      (3)   The design and materials are compatible with the type of use and
development proposed;
      (4)   The design and materials can easily be adapted to another use in
the future; and
      (5)   The design and materials meet the intent of this section.
   (d)   Mixture of Materials. The application of these standards promotes
integration and mixture of materials where more than one (1) material is used
on a building. If only one (1) material is used, architectural detailing and
articulation, massing, texture and form must be introduced into the building
design, unless otherwise specified in the Table of Acceptable Exterior Wall
Materials (see subsection (b) of this Section). Building roof materials must be
in harmony with the style and materials used on the building walls.
   (e)   Long Walls. When building walls are seventy-five (75) feet or greater
in length, design variations must be applied to assure that the building is not
monotonous in appearance. Such variations include but are not limited to the
following:
      (1)    Recesses and projections along the building facade, which must be
a minimum of one (1) foot in depth;
      (2)    Architectural details or features;
      (3)    Enhanced ornamentation around building entryways;
      (4)    Landscaping for which size, species, and number are acceptable to
the Zoning Administrator;
      (5)    Streetscape elements; and
      (6)    Variations in building height.
         (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.06 ROOF DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL STRUCTURES.
   (a)    Compatible Design Character. Roof design and materials are considered
to be key elements to the city character, and thus must be consistent with the
character of the neighborhood or other areas of the city regardless of the
zoning district. As a part of building design, roofs must be designed in
keeping with the overall architecture of the building and other structures
located on the same property (see Section
1136.05 (d)).
   (b)   Roof Materials. The following regulations apply to roof materials:
      (1)   Asphalt, fiberglass, tile, slate or cedar shingles may be used in
all districts.
      (2)   Metal roof systems may be permitted by the chief building official
and zoning administrator (or designee), based upon installation quality, panel
design, coating quality, metal type, and metal thickness. However, a sample
must be provided to verify each of the above requirements before its use can be
considered. The color must also be subtle and compatible with the exterior
building materials.
      (3)   Roofing materials shall be the same material and color on all on-
site structures unless deemed an accent by the Zoning Administrator (or
designee).
   (c)   Roof Style in the Residential Districts. These districts are intended
to maintain a residential character in the city and to be compatible with the
neighborhood. To meet this intent the following roof style elements are
required:
      (1)   Peaked roofs are required in single and two-family districts unless
approved by the Zoning Administrator and Chief Building Official. In which
case, the applicant must demonstrate the architectural reason and subsequent
compatibility with the surrounding area.
      (2)   All roofs must be gambrel, hip or gable roof styles. The Chief
Building Official and Zoning Administrator (or designee) may approve the use of
shed roofs for porches and other extensions of the primary structure, provided
that they comprise (in aggregate) no more that twenty-five percent (25%) of the
total square footage of the roofs and/or are demonstrated to be necessary to
provide architectural compatibility.
      (3)    Additional roofline treatments are encouraged and may be required
by the Chief Building Official and Zoning Administrator (or designee) in order
to minimize the mass of the roof and in order to promote the residential
character. These treatments include, but are not limited to offset rooflines,
dormer windows, cupolas, additional accent gables and covered entryways.
    (d)    Roof Style in the C-3 District. New building construction must blend
with the existing established building line of the Uptown Commercial District.
The buildings must be a minimum of two (2) stories and story height shall be a
minimum of twelve (12) feet for the first story and nine (9) feet thereafter.
Roofs must be flat or sloped with a maximum 2/12 pitch and a minimum three-foot
high parapet and decorative cornices, in keeping with the historic architecture
of the Uptown Commercial District. An enclosure must be provided that is at
least one (1) foot higher than rooftop mechanical equipment that is taller than
three (3) feet. Building material for this screening must be approved by the
Chief Building Official and the Zoning Administrator.
   (e)    Roof Style in the C-1 District. New building construction in this
district should attempt to emulate the design character and history of the
residential neighborhoods which often surround this district. At the same time,
the buildings must accommodate the types of uses and sites proposed. As such,
the following roof styles are required:
      (1)    Additional roofline treatments are encouraged and may be required
by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) in order to minimize the mass of the
roof and in order to promote the residential character when appropriate. These
treatments include, but are not limited to dormer windows, cupolas, additional
accent gables and covered entryways; and
      (2)    The Zoning Administrator (or designee) may allow a gentler pitched
roof including a flat roof with a minimum three-foot high parapet and
decorative cornices consistent with the design standards of subsection (d) of
this section.
   (f)    Roof Style in the C-2, C-4, M-1, and M-2 Districts. New building
construction in these districts should complement their surroundings. Buildings
should be multiple stories. Single story buildings may be permitted under
special circumstances or with certain uses. All single story buildings shall be
reviewed and approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. At the
same time, the buildings must accommodate the types of uses and sites proposed.
As such, the following roof styles are required:
      (1)    The roofs of large buildings (i.e., two thousand (2,000) square
feet or greater) may be flat as long as a minimum three-foot high parapet at
least three (3) feet high and decorative cornices consistent with the design
standards of subsection (d) of this section are part of the roof design. A
peaked roof is required for smaller structures and extensions of larger
buildings; and
   (g)    Screening Rooftop Equipment. New or replacement rooftop equipment,
including but not limited to, HVAC, kitchen vents, hood or exhausts equipment,
shall be screened from view of adjacent properties and the nearest public
rights-of-way and the nearest public rights-of-way on all sides the property.
The method to screen rooftop equipment must complement the buildings color
sale, materials, and architectural style unless the Chief Building Official
and/or Zoning Administrator can demonstrate a hardship which requires
modification and/or waiving this requirement. Rooftop screening on a one story
structures may be accomplished by using ground level vegetation that will
mature in growth within five (5) years at the time of planting; location of the
planting will be at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator (or designee).
The Zoning Administrator (or designee) may require cross-section details to
confirm compliance.

   (c)    The window area of a facade above the first floor shall be a minimum
of thirty-five percent (35%) and cannot exceed sixty-five percent (65%) of the
total facade area of that floor.
   (d)   Windows above the first floor must be vertical in proportion (whether
a single unit or combined units) unless deemed impractical due to structural
limitations in which case all windows must be broken-up to maintain the same
vertical proportion.
   (e)    Windows and glass doors must be clear glass and not tinted. Samples
complete with a VLT rating of seventy-five percent (75%) or higher shall be
provided in advance of installation to ensure compliance with this requirement.
The appropriate light transference shall be determined by the Chief Building
Official and the Zoning Administrator.
   (f)   Fixed hung windows must be used in all retail and store front
applications unless a deviance from this standard can be shown to be
architecturally compatible and/or shown to accentuate the district in which it
is located.
   (g)   Sliding windows will not be permitted in the C-3 District, while
sliding doors will be permitted above the ground floor in the C-3 District

(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.08 PARKING LOTS AND SITE STANDARDS.
   Parking areas shall be designed so as to maximize accessibility and
convenience, while ensuring that parking does not dominate the streetscape and
site design and shall be subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   The design of parking facilities shall define spaces for safe
pedestrian movement and spaces where people change modes of travel. Parking
areas in excess of one-hundred (100) parking spaces must provide pedestrian
walkways that are separate and distinguished from parking or vehicular
circulation. Walkways may cross parking aisles or driveways if distinguished
from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface
materials such as pavers, bricks, scored concrete or scored and painted asphalt
to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort. When appropriate, crosswalks may be
required to be a "Table Top" design. The Zoning Administrator shall, at their
discretion, approve the location, materials and design of all walkways and
crosswalks.
   (b)   Placing large amounts of parking between the front door of buildings
and the adjacent street contributes to a formless arrival experience for users,
and creates a detached relationship between the primary building and the
street. When not prohibited by another section of this code, the placement of
all off-street parking between the front facade of the principal building and
the primary abutting street(s) shall be avoided unless approved at the
discretion of the City Administrator and Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning
Administrator approves off-street parking spaces to be located between the
front facade of the principal building and the Primary Street(s) abutting the
site, then additional landscaping, mounding and/or buffering between the
parking area and the primary street(s) may be required as a condition of this
approval.
   (c)   In order to reduce the scale of parking areas, no single parking area
shall exceed one hundred (100) spaces unless divided into two or more sub-areas
separated from each other by a buffer strip consisting of landscaping, access
drives or public streets, pedestrian walkways, or buildings. This requirement
is in addition to the requirements imposed by Chapters
1145 (Minimum Landscape Requirements) and
1141 (Off-Street Parking and Loading). Safe and clearly defined pedestrian
walkways, leading to store entrances, must be provided within large parking
lots.
   (d)   Large parking areas in multiple building developments shall be divided
into small lots related to the buildings served.
   (e)   Site design shall include an external orientation to the public
street, and an internal orientation to the surrounding neighborhood with
connected open space and pedestrian pathways.
      (1)   The primary entrance of the building(s) shall be located on the
facade facing the street.
      (2)   Site design emphasis should be given to the pedestrian, rather than
the auto through placement of parking to the side or rear of the building,
rather than in front.
      (3)   When physical site limitations such as topography; existing trees
or other natural features or special circumstances prevent the main entrance
from being located on the street-facing facade, the Zoning Administrator may,
at their discretion, approve the building oriented to a courtyard or other
feature with a prominent pedestrian entrance and clear connection to the public
sidewalk.
         (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.09 PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION.
   An integrated pedestrian circulation system should be provided throughout
the development with minimal contact points between pedestrians and vehicular
paths. All sites and developments shall feature a fully integrated pedestrian
circulation system, connecting buildings, structures, open space, and parking
areas with the adjacent street sidewalk system. Pedestrian circulation shall
consist of sidewalks, walkways, crosswalks or designated pathways, raised or
otherwise separated and distinguished from parking and vehicular circulation
and subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   At least one continuous internal pedestrian connecting walkway for
each primary street frontage, no less than eight (8) feet and no more than
twelve (12) feet in width and clear of any vehicle overhangs, shall be provided
from the public sidewalk or right-of-way linking the principal customer
entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall
connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to,
transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall
feature items such as adjoining landscaped areas that includes trees, shrubs,
benches, flower beds, planters, groundcover, or other such materials for no
less than thirty percent (30%) of its length. The location and width of the
pedestrian connecting walkway shall be approved at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator.
   (b)   Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of the building
along any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade abutting
public parking areas. Such sidewalks shall be located an average of six (6)
feet from the facade of the building to provide planting beds for foundation
landscaping, except where features such as arcades, display windows, planters
or entryways are part of the facade. The location and width of all sidewalks
shall be approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator but at no time
shall the required width of any sidewalk be less than six (6) feet or more than
twelve (12) feet and be clear of any vehicle overhangs.
   (c)   Customer entrances shall have weather protection features such as
awnings, pergolas, porticos, arcades, or vestibules approved at the discretion
of the Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   All internal pedestrian walkways may cross parking aisles or driveways
and shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable,
low-maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, scored concrete, or
scored and painted asphalt to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort. When
appropriate, crosswalk may be required to be a "Table Top" design. The Zoning
Administrator shall, at their discretion, approve the location, materials and
design of all crosswalks.
      (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.10 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   The Landscaping and Screening standards of Chapter
1145 (Minimum Landscaping Requirements) and Chapter
966 of the Codified Ordinances shall apply.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   
   1136.11 BUILDING DESIGN ACCENT STANDARDS.
   (a)    Front Facade. Blank walls cannot face a public street. Walls facing a
public street must include windows and architectural features customarily found
on the front facade of a building, such as awnings, cornice work, edge
detailing or other decorative finish materials. A prominent and usable public
building entrance must be provided at the front of the building. Wall massing
must be broken up with vertical pilasters or other architectural elements to
reduce scale.
   (b)    Pedestrian Orientation. Buildings must be designed at a pedestrian
scale with relationship to the street and sidewalk. Buildings must include
windows that face the sidewalk and street. Convenient and safe pedestrian
access must be provided between the public sidewalk and the building entrance.
   (c)   Awnings. Awnings with straight sheds may supplement facades. Awnings
cannot be cubed or curved except over doorways. Translucent or internally lit
cloth awnings will not be permitted. However, metal awnings may be internally
lit provided there is a solid metal roof and all lighting complies with section
1136.13 of this Chapter. In no case may awnings be designed to cover more than
twenty percent (20%) of the height of each story of a building.
 
   (d)   Canopies. Canopies, such as over gasoline pumps or drive-through
structures, must be designed to be consistent with the approved building
materials and colors. Support columns must be brick or comprised of materials
compatible with the principal structure. The zoning administrator (or designee)
or planning commission may require a peaked roof to complement the principal
building. Any canopy lighting must be flush with the canopy.
   (e)    Neon. Exposed neon will not be permitted on a building.
   (f)   Quality and Workmanship. This section is not intended to regulate the
quality, workmanship and requirements for materials relative to strength and
durability.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.12 BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ONE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY DWELLING
UNITS.
   (a)   The following are building design standards for one-family and two-
family dwelling units.
      (1)   Applicability. The regulations of this subsection apply to one-
family and two-family dwelling unit construction under the following
circumstances:
         A.   New dwellings. All new one-family and two-family dwelling
construction that requires a building permit after the effective date of this
section must fully comply with the design standards of this subsection.
         B.   Expansions to dwellings. For dwellings existing prior to the
effective date of this section, major improvements or expansions that require a
building permit may be permitted without a complete upgrade to meet the
standards of this subsection. Reasonable improvements are required in relation
to the scale and construction cost of the project. All exterior renovations
must be consistent with the building design standards herein to the extent
deemed practical by the Chief Building Official and the Zoning Administrator.
         C.   Minor improvements to dwellings. For dwellings existing prior to
the effective date of this section, minor changes, improvements, and
modifications that require a building permit will not be required to comply
with this subsection, provided the improvements do not increase or perpetuate
non-comformity of the structure or the site with the requirements of this
subsection.
      (2)    Intent. The purpose of this subsection is to establish standards
and regulations governing the location and appearance of one-family and two-
family dwelling units in the City of Maumee that are either developed as a new
neighborhood or as in-fill housing in an existing neighborhood. It is the
intent of these regulations to allow a mix of housing types and living styles
in a manner that will not adversely affect existing neighborhoods. For this
reason, standards have been set that will regulate the appearance of one-family
and two-family dwellings, allowing only those that are compatibly similar in
appearance to houses on individual lots in all zoning districts that allow one-
family and two-family residences. These regulations will not apply to one-
family dwellings located within a state licensed manufacturing housing
community.
      (3)    Permits. Prior to the construction or installation of a one-family
or two-family dwelling unit on a residential lot, the individual must obtain a
building permit from the Chief Building Official and a zoning permit from the
Zoning Administrator (or designee).
      (4)   General appearance and site standards. To ensure the compatibility
in appearance of one-family and two-family dwelling units, such units must meet
the following design and site standards:
         A.   Be constructed to the most current local, state and federal
building standards.
         B.   Have a minimum dimension of twenty (20) feet.
         C.   Comply with the gross floor area and lot coverage standards for
one-family or two-family dwelling units set forth in Chapter
1125. To ensure that neighboring dwellings are compatible in scale and mass,
the city may require units to be not less than ninety percent (90%) and no more
than one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the average floor area and lot
coverage of other one-family or two-family dwelling units within three hundred
(300) feet of the subject lot, including dwelling units on both sides of the
street of the same block.
         D.   Have two (2) exterior doors (front and rear, or front and side),
and where there is a difference in ground elevation, steps must be permanently
attached on a frost depth foundation either to the perimeter wall or to porches
connected to the perimeter wall.
         E.   Have a minimum eight-inch eave and rake (i.e., overhang), and
with a drainage system that will collect and concentrate the discharge of storm
water or snow away from the sides of the dwelling. The roof must have wood
shake, asphalt or other acceptable shingles, and meet the snow load standards
for this portion of the State of Ohio. Metal roof systems may be permitted by
the Zoning Administrator (or designee) based upon installation quality, panel
design, coating quality, metal type, and metal thickness.
         F.   Have an exterior finish architecturally compatible to that of
other similar homes in the surrounding area. Plywood, oriented strand board
(OSB), T-111 siding, and similar materials are strictly prohibited.
         G.   Be firmly attached to a permanent foundation constructed on the
site in accordance with the Ohio Residential Building Code and must have a wall
of the same perimeter dimensions of the dwelling and constructed of such
materials and type as required in the applicable building code for one-family
or two-family dwellings.
         H.   Have a design and appearance determined to be compatible by the
Zoning Administrator (or designee) upon review of the plans submitted for a
particular dwelling. An aggrieved party may appeal the Zoning Administrator's
decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
            Compatibility is based upon the character, design and appearance of
one (1) or more residential dwellings within three hundred (300) feet of the
subject dwelling provided the surrounding existing dwellings considered are
located outside of a manufactured housing community. The foregoing will not be
construed to prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as
solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief from the common or standard
design homes.
         I.   Be connected to the public sewer, storm and water utilities
operated by the City of Maumee.
         J.   Orient all dwelling units toward the public right-of-way such
that the facade that faces the street contains a door, windows and other
architectural features customary of the front facade of a residence.
         K.   Provide concrete sidewalks in accordance with the standard
required by the Chief Building Official and the Zoning Administrator within the
dedicated right-of-way along the frontage length of all parcels. The portion of
the sidewalk that crosses the driveway shall be of a different material, unless
concrete, and float separately from the driveway and approach. An inclined
approach is required where sidewalks intersect curbs for barrier free access.
The inclined approach must comply with grades established by ODOT. Required
sidewalks may be installed following the construction of the dwelling unit.
However, a certificate of occupancy will not be issued until the sidewalk is
installed along the individual lot's frontages. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that, due to weather conditions, sidewalk installation should be
delayed, a certificate of occupancy may be issued. In which case, a performance
guarantee must be provided to the City. The sidewalk must be installed within
six (6) months of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The Zoning
Administrator will schedule a follow-up inspection.
         L.   All residential driveways shall have a concrete approach and a
hard-surfaced driveway of concrete or plant-mixed bituminous material in
accordance with specifications of the City. Approaches must have a compacted
six (6) inches thick base and be six (6) inches thick, concrete, with the
sidewalk floating separate from approaches. The maximum width of a residential
approach shall not exceed twenty (22) feet at the curb line which includes
tapers and twenty (20) feet wide in the front yard of a structure or property
The minimum asphalt depth for driveways must be three (3) inches. The minimum
concrete depth for driveways must be four (4) inches. Up to two (2) dwellings
may be permitted to share a driveway provided it complies with these
construction standards.
         M.   The provisions of this subsection will not apply to manufactured
homes situated in licensed manufactured housing communities.
         N.   In all zoning districts accessory structures must comply with the
standards of Chapter
1133. The exterior material and roof line shall compliment the exterior
material and roof style of the principle structure. The Zoning Administrator
(or designee) may approve a different siding that compliments the principal
structure. Plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), T-111 siding and similar
materials are strictly prohibited. (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1136.13 LIGHTING STANDARDS.
   (a)   When used in this section, the following definitions shall apply:
      (1)    “Average illumination” means the overall average of all points on
the surface of the illuminated area including the brightest and dimmest points.
      (2)   “Canopy structure” means any overhead protective structure, which
is constructed in a manner to allow pedestrians/vehicles to pass under.
      (3)    “Flood light” means a fixture designed to "flood" a well-defined
area with light.
      (4)    “Footcandle (fc)” means a unit of illumination produced on a
surface all points of which are one (1) foot from a uniform point source
equivalent to one candle in brightness of illumination.
      (5)    “Glare” means the sensation produced by a bright source within the
visual field that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes are
adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and
visibility (e.g., blinding light). The magnitude of glare depends on factors
such as the size, position, brightness of the source, and on the brightness
level to which the eyes are adapted.
      (6)    “Lamp” means the component of the luminaire that produces the
actual light including luminous tube lighting.
      (7)    “Lamp lumen depreciation (LLD)” means a factor (i.e., between 0.0
and 1.0) used to describe how the lamp output changes with time compared to the
initial output. Typical LLD factors (depending principally on lamp type) for
outdoor lighting types are as follows: metal halide: 0.84, compact fluorescent:
0.85, high pressure sodium: 0.91 and mercury vapor: 0.79.
      (8)    “Light loss factor (LLF)” means a factor (i.e., between 0.0 and
1.0) describing light output of a luminaire after losses due to dirt
accumulation (i.e., luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD)) and lamp lumen
depreciation (LLD), relative to the output when the lamp and luminaire are new
(i.e., LLF = LDD × LLD).
      (9)    “Light fixture” means the assembly that holds a lamp and may
include an assembly housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder,
a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and a refractor or lens. A light fixture also
includes the assembly for luminous tube and fluorescent lighting.
      (10)    “Light pollution” means artificial light which causes a
detrimental effect on the environment, enjoyment of the night sky or causes
undesirable glare or unnecessary illumination of adjacent properties.
      (11)    “Light trespass” means the shining of light produced by a
luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
      (12)    “Luminaire” means the complete lighting system including the lamp
and light fixture.
      (13)    “Luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD)” means a factor (i.e., between
0.0 and 1.0) used to describe how much light produced by the lamp is lost to
dirt accumulation and other changes in the optical characteristics of the
luminaire, relative to the value when the luminaire is new, depending on the
quality of the luminaire, materials used, maintenance, and environment.
      (14)    “Mounting height” means the vertical distance between the surface
to be illuminated and the bottom of the light source.
      (15)    “Outdoor light fixtures” mean outdoor artificial illuminating
devices, outdoor fixtures, lamps and other similar devices, permanently
installed or portable, used for flood lighting, general illumination or
advertisement.
      (16)    “Shielded fixture” means outdoor light fixtures constructed so
that light rays emitted by the fixture are projected below the horizontal plane
passing through the lowest point on the fixture from which light is emitted
(i.e. a shoebox-type fixture or a cutoff fixture as defined by the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America) and meet the "Dark Sky Society"
recommendations. The fixtures almost always have a flat, horizontally oriented
lens and opaque (usually metal) sides. A luminaire mounted in a recessed
fashion under a canopy or other structure so that the surrounding structure
effectively shields the light in the same manner is also considered fully
shielded for the purposes of this section.
      (17)    “Spot light” means a lighting assembly designed to direct the
output of a contained lamp in a specific tightly focused direction (a beam)
with a reflector located external to the lamp.
      (18)    “Uniformity” means a measure indicating how evenly light is
distributed across a surface. Typically the measure is expressed as a ratio of
one value to another, such as average to minimum, or maximum to minimum. Using
ratios, perfect uniformity would be 1:1.

   Lamp Lumens
   (b)   Intent and Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the public by recognizing the need for buildings
and sites to be illuminated for safety, security and visibility for pedestrians
and motorists balanced against the often detrimental effects associated with
the use of outdoor lighting. This section provides standards for various forms
of lighting that will minimize light pollution; reduce the potential for off-
site impacts; preserve the restful quality of nighttime by eliminating
intrusive artificial light and lighting that unnecessarily contributes to sky
glow; reduce light pollution and light trespass from light sources onto
adjacent properties; enhance customer and employee safety; contribute to
improving visibility by requiring illuminated areas to have uniform light; and
curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment.
   (c)   Applicability. The standards in this section apply to any light source
visible beyond the property from which it is emanating. The Zoning
Administrator (or designee) may review any building or site to determine
compliance with the requirements under this section. Whenever a person is
required to obtain a building permit, electrical permit for outdoor lighting or
illuminated signs, a conditional use permit, subdivision approval or Site Plan
approval from the city, the applicant must submit sufficient information to
enable the Zoning Administrator (or designee) or Planning Commission to
determine whether the proposed lighting will comply with this section.
   (d)    Exemptions.
      (1)    Street lights located in a public right-of-way or another public
easement is exempt from the lighting requirements of this chapter without any
conditions.
      (2)    The following are exempt from the lighting requirements of this
chapter, provided that they do not shine beyond the property line and have no
glare or other detrimental effects on adjoining streets or property owners:
         A.   Residential lighting associated with one- and two-family
dwellings.
         B.   Private swimming pools;
         C.   Holiday decorations; and
         D.   Window displays only if they are below 500 lumens.
   (e)    Submittal Requirements. The following information must be included
for all Site Plan submissions which include any existing or new exterior
lighting and where site plan approval is not required, some or all of the items
may be required by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) prior to zoning
approval or lighting installation:
      (1)    The location of all outdoor lighting fixtures, including but not
limited to pole-mounted, building-mounted (including outline lighting),
architectural accent, landscape (including walkway bollards), and canopy light
fixtures on the site plan and building elevations;
      (2)    A photometric grid overlaid on the proposed site plan indicating
the light intensity throughout the site (in footcandles (fc)). Measurements
must be at ground level and shown at ten-foot spacing;
      (3)    The manufacturer's specification sheets and details for the type
of fixture being proposed including but not limited to light intensity levels
(in footcandles (fc)) at ground level based on fixture mounting height, the
total lumen output, type of lamp, distribution type and method of shielding;
      (4)    The maximum and minimum foot candle (fc) calculations, minimum-to-
maximum and minimum-to-average uniformity ratios, and the light loss factor
(LLF) used. These statistics must be provided for areas where vehicular and
pedestrian movement is provided for and for other areas as necessary to show
compliance with standards of subsection (g) of this section.
      (5)    Use of fixture(s) proposed; and
      (6)    Any other information deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator
in accordance with the intent and purpose of this section.
   (f)    General Standards. 
      (1)    Unless otherwise permitted within subsection
1136.13 (d) or subsection
1136.13 (g), only shielded fixtures as defined in Section
1136.13 (a) may be used. Any interior light fixtures that are deemed to be
causing glare and therefore not meeting the purpose or intent of this Chapter
must be shielded to prevent glare outside the building and do not shine beyond
the property line.
      (2)    Decorative fixtures using lamps with low wattages do not have to
be shielded; these include incandescent lamps of sixty (60) watts or less;
glass tubes filled with neon, argon and krypton; and any other light source of
fifty (50) watts or less. Decorative luminaries above fifty (50) watts must
have internal and/or external reflectors that shield the light source.

      (3)    It is recognized that metal halide LED, inductive, and fluorescent
lamps are superior lights for color and object recognition when compared to
other lamp types such as low and high pressure sodium or mercury vapor.
Therefore, use of metal halide, LED, inductive, and fluorescent lamps is
required unless the Zoning Administrator (or designee) or Planning Commission
determines that unique circumstances exist that prevent installation of the
required lamp types. It is also recognized that as the lighting industry
develops, new lamp types are occasionally introduced that may have similar
characteristics as the currently required types that may also be desirable for
use in outdoor lighting.
      (4)    The intensity of light on a site must not exceed one-half of one-
tenth (0.05) of a foot candle (fc) at any property line that abuts a
residentially zoned property or half (0.5) of a foot candle (fc) for any other
zoned property.
      (5)    All exterior lighting must be designed in a consistent and
coordinated manner for the entire site.
      (6)    Indirect internal illumination of signs and canopies is permitted
provided a maximum one hundred twenty-five (125) watt bulb is utilized and the
transmittal surface is of a color and material that effectively shields lamps.
This does not take into consideration fluorescent, LED, or neon light sources
typically used in these applications.
   (g)   Lighting Intensity and Uniformity Standards. 
      (1)   Table of standards. The following lighting intensity and uniformity
standards must be used in designing an outdoor lighting plan as required within
subsection (e) of this chapter.

      (2)   Footnotes to the table. 
         A.   The above statistics should only be applied to the area of each
site devoted to the particular use. For example, a gas station/restaurant
combination may have an area dedicated as a parking lot for the restaurant
patrons and in addition have a pump island canopy. In this scenario two sets of
statistics would need to be generated; one set for the parking lot and the
other set for the canopy area.
         B.    Measurements for average to minimum uniformity ratio, required
minimum foot candle (fc) reading, maximum allowable average illumination and
maximum allowable foot candle (fc) reading must be generated at the surface
intended to be illuminated (e.g., pavement or area surface). These statistics
must be provided for areas where vehicular and pedestrian movement is provided
for and other areas as necessary to show compliance with standards.
         C.    Building facades and signs cannot be illuminated if they are of
glass, polished metal or other glossy surface including painted surfaces.
Building facades cannot be entirely illuminated. Rather, illumination can be
for architectural ornament and/or the illumination of small areas for
visibility and security. For spotlight fixtures, no less than ninety (90)
percent of the light beam must be concentrated on the surface intended to be
illuminated. For fixtures mounted directly to a wall surface or sign, external
shields or dark colored non-reflective surface materials or other appropriate
methods must be used to direct the light perpendicular to the ground and
minimize reflectance glare.
         D.    The maximum height of parking lot light fixtures, from grade,
shall be as follows:
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/72af8c5e772645064c8bf4b44a5b2dbd9d81a293/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4243_6096x2628.jpg]
   Fixture Height
   1.    Up to twelve (12) feet in a residential district;
   2.    Up to eighteen (18) feet in a commercial district;
   3.    Up to twenty-two (22) feet in an industrial district.
      (3)    Exterior recreational facilities. For exterior recreational
facilities, sufficient information must be submitted in addition to that
required in subsection (e) of this section that demonstrates that the location,
selection and aiming of all lighting fixtures will focus light on the playing
areas, minimize glare and visibility from adjacent and nearby properties and
roadways and minimize sky glow. A written explanation and statements must be
supplied explaining why locations, fixtures types, intensities, orientation of
fixtures and other decisions were made. Lighting of sports facilities cannot be
operated except during an event and must be turned off no later than forty-five
(45) minutes after the event is over.
      (4)   Uses not specifically listed. For uses not specifically listed
within this Section, but determined to be of a type, use and or intensity that
may be detrimental to achieving the purpose of this chapter, the Zoning
Administrator, depending on the purpose of the lighting, must classify lighting
into one of the categories contained in subsection
1136.13 (g) of this chapter. An applicant may appeal an initial classification
to the Zoning Administrator, in writing, detailing why more intense lighting or
less lighting is necessary. The Zoning Administrator must either approve or
deny the appeal based on whether or not sufficient justification has been
submitted and whether the proposal meets the intent of this Code. Final
determinations of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
   (h)    Prohibited Outdoor Lighting.
      (1)    The use of a laser light source, searchlights or any similar high
intensity light for outdoor advertisement or entertainment is prohibited except
in conjunction with a special event and shall be approved at the discretion of
the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)    Lighting cannot be of a flashing, moving or intermittent type
except in conjunction with a special event and shall be approved at the
discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
   (i)   Lamp or Fixture Substitution. Should any light fixture regulated under
this section, or the type of light source therein, be changed after the permit
has been issued, a change request must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator
for approval, together with adequate information to assure compliance with this
code, which must be received prior to substitution.
   (j)    Administration.
      (1)   An outdoor lighting permit must be issued on a form from the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) if it is determined by the Zoning Administrator (or
designee) or Planning Commission that a proposal fulfills the requirements and
intent and purpose of this chapter. The permit must list what is being approved
and contain copies of relevant documents.
      (2)    The Zoning Administrator has the discretion to require the re-
direction of existing light fixtures when it is determined that the fixture is
not in compliance with the requirements of this code.

   1136.14 CONFLICT.
   When there is a conflict between Chapter
1136 and another part, chapter or section of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Maumee, the City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning
Administrator shall determine which part, chapter or section shall apply.

in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site
features and a description of any planned roadway improvements. The study shall
define and justify the study area selected for analysis.
   (b)   Description of the Proposed Development. A description of factors such
as the number and types of dwelling units, the gross and usable floor area, the
number of employees, and shift change factors. Intended phasing or future
expansion shall also be noted.
   (c)   Description of Existing Traffic Conditions. Traffic counts: Existing
conditions including existing peak-hour traffic volumes (and daily volumes if
applicable) on street(s) adjacent to the site. Existing counts and levels of
service for intersections in the vicinity, which are expected to be impacted,
shall be provided. Traffic count data shall not be more than two (2) years old.
Further, the description of existing traffic conditions shall include:
      (1)   Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
of non-holiday weeks.

      (3)   Existing driveways and potential turning movement conflicts in the
vicinity of the site shall be illustrated and described.
      (4)   The existing right-of-way shall be identified along with any
planned expansion of the right-of-way.
   (d)   Background Traffic Growth. For any project requiring a Traffic Impact
Study, the analysis shall include forecasted traffic at the date of
construction completion and within a subsequent 20-year period. Forecasted
traffic volumes shall take into account expected traffic flow from adjacent
vacant property. Assumptions regarding future surrounding land use and growth
in traffic volumes shall be approved by the City of Maumee before submission of
the traffic impact study.
   (e)   Trip Generation. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed
development for the a.m. (if applicable) and p.m. peak hour and average day
shall be calculated. This forecast shall be based on the data and procedures
outlined in the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other recognized data source
for a comparable use.
      (1)   Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ridesharing, other
modes, internal capture rates, etc., shall be based both on ITE findings and
documented survey results acceptable to the City of Maumee. The community may
elect to reduce the trip reduction rates used.
      (2)   For projects intended to be developed in phases, the trip
generation by phase shall be described.
   (f)   Trip Distribution. The projected traffic generated shall be
distributed (inbound v. outbound, left turn v. right turn) onto the existing
street network to project turning movements at site access points and nearby
intersections where required.
      (1)   Projected turning movements shall be illustrated in the report.
      (2)   A description of the application of engineering methods for
determining the distribution shall be attached (trip distribution model, market
studies, counts at existing driveways, etc.).

comprise at least five (5) percent of the existing intersection capacity.
   (h)   Access Design/Access Management Standards. The study shall include a
map and description of the location and design of proposed access (driveways or
new street intersections) including: any sight distance limitations, dimensions
from adjacent driveways and intersections within two hundred fifty (250) feet
on either side of the main roadway, data to demonstrate that the number of
driveways proposed is the fewest necessary, and support that the access points
will provide safe and efficient traffic operation.
   (i)   Other Study Items.  The Traffic Impact Study shall also include the
following:
      (1)   Need for, or provision of, any additional right-of-way.

Zoning Administrator or their designee may approve a wider curb cut due to
unique location or other special circumstances. In a use other than one or two-
family residential, the Zoning Administrator or their designee may approve a
wider curb cut in order to accommodate a boulevard style entrance with a curbed
landscape island separating the entrance and exit drive. All curb cuts must
meet the design and construction requirements set forth in subsection 1141.08
(d) and all other City, State and Federal regulations.

blocks may be approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. Compacted
stone or other loose material shall be prohibited.
      (1)   Except to meet ADA requirements or areas necessary to facilitate an
engineered spillway, the entire perimeter of all parking areas, entrance drives
and landscape islands shall have a continuous solid concrete curb and gutter to
match ODOT type 2. ODOT types 3 and 6 may be permitted alternatives. The
location and type of curb and gutter will be approved at the discretion of the
Zoning Administrator. The use of curb blocks shall be prohibited. Curbing
requirement does not apply to a one or two-family residential use.
      (2)   In one and two-family uses, in areas outside of the right-of-way,
concrete shall be a minimum of four (4) inches thick and asphalt shall be a
minimum of three (3) inches thick with a six (6) to eight (8) inch compacted
aggregate base.
      (3)   In uses other than one and two-family concrete and asphalt outside

industrial zoning district with curbed streets, it shall be prohibited to drop
the curb by saw cutting off the top. Curbs must be plunge cut at the outside
limits of the approach and the approach, curb and gutter pan shall be installed

      (7)   It is recognized that certain soil conditions may exist that would
allow for a reduction in the amount of material or compacted base required, or
would require additional material or compacted base. Based upon an on-site
inspection of the soil after grading has taken place, the Zoning Administrator,
Capital Projects Manager, and City Administrator or their designee, may
increase or decrease the amount of material or compacted base that will be
required to an amount that differs from what is shown on the approved site plan
or permit application.
   (e)   Access. All parking spaces required by this Chapter and in excess of
those required by this Chapter must have direct access to a drive isle.
   (f)   Sidewalks and Crosswalks. Sidewalks and marked and/or raised
crosswalks shall adequately provide for the safe movement of pedestrians in all
parking areas except in one or two-family residential use and along all public
streets. Sidewalks through a driveway in the public right-of-way must float
separate from the approach and be concrete. The material, location, width and
marking of all sidewalks and crosswalks shall be approved at the discretion of
the Zoning Administrator and the Plan Commission (if required), but at no time
shall the required width of any sidewalk be less than five (5) feet for
residential and six (6) feet for commercial, or more than twelve (12) feet.
There shall be radiuses at all turns or intersections of sidewalks and

      (Ord. 107-2020. Passed 10-5-20.)
   1141.12 SPECIAL PARKING PROVISIONS.
   The City of Maumee recognizes that there may be special circumstances in
which it is appropriate and desirable to use alternative, permeable hard
surfaced materials in both residential use and, in limited circumstances, in
commercial and industrial use locations. The use of the lighter colored
materials which will still allow grass to grow in and around them also helps to
reduce the "Heat Island" effect that you get from vast areas of blacktop which,
in a lot of cases, is only fully used a few weeks out of each year. In
commercial and Industrial use locations, these areas would typically be areas
that would accommodate this overflow parking for a short period of time each
year. In residential use, this could include driveways and permitted RV storage
locations. The location, use, and material of any alternative, permeable hard-
surfaced area shall be approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
Below are some examples of these materials:

   1141.13 CONFLICTS.
   When there is a conflict between Chapter
1141 and another part, chapter or section of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Maumee, the City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning

   1143.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to permit such signs as will not, by reasons
of their size, location, construction or manner of display, endanger life and
limb, confuse or mislead traffic, obstruct vision necessary for traffic safety
or otherwise endanger the public morals, health or safety; and further, to
regulate such permitted signs in such a way as to create land use patterns
compatible with other major land use objectives and to prevent such signs from
causing annoyance or disturbance to the citizens and residents of the City.
   1143.02  COMPUTATIONS.
   (a)   Computation of Sign Area. The aggregate surface area of a sign or of
all the signs on a property shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   If sign area calculations are completed by the applicant and
provided to the City as a part of the application, the area of a sign (which is
also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, rectangle or contiguous combination
thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the copy, representation,
emblem and/or other display including all area within individual letters and
between individual letters, words, representations and emblems or logos;
      (2)   The area of a sign, or any portion thereof, shall exclude any
decorative embellishments and any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such structures do not include letters, parts of letters,
words, figures, numerals, emblems, devices, designs, trademarks, posters,
handbills or other objects affixed thereon and is clearly incidental to the
display itself.
      (3)   The area of a sign, or any portion thereof, having a distinctive
design, color, or ornamental background commonly known and identified with the
trade or business which sets the background apart from a larger surface so that
it forms an integral part or element of the sign, including any frame that
forms an integral part of the display or is used to differentiate the sign from
the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, shall include the area of
the distinctive design, color, or ornamental background.
      (4)   The total area of a sign having two faces with a maximum distance
between the two faces less than forty-two (42) inches at any point of each
face, shall be considered to be the area of the largest face.
      (5)   The total area of a sign having more than two faces shall be the
sum of the area of all the faces of the sign, less the area of the smallest
face.
      (6)   If sign area calculations are not provided by the applicant as part
of the application, the area of a sign shall be computed by the City by means
of the smallest single square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme
limits of the copy, representation, emblem, and/or other display including all
area within individual letters and between individual letters, words,
representations and emblems or logos.
   (b)   Computation of Freestanding Sign Height. The height of a freestanding
sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal
grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. In cases in
which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be
computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base
of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the curb of a
public street, or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
(Ord. 057-2012. Passed 3-19-12.)

of any lot or on any public right of way for the purpose of advertising any
service, product or facility.
   (c)   Private traffic control signs such as stop, yield, in, out, drive-in
window entrance, exit, etc. as long as the sign meets Department of
Transportation standards and contain no advertising, logo, or name for the
business or use.

between November 15 and January 15.
   (e)   Flags of the United States, the state, city, foreign nations having

sanctioned by an elected legislative body of competent jurisdiction provided
that such a flag shall be flown in accordance with protocol established by the

any one or more of these conditions shall be considered a banner or a pennant
sign and shall be subject to regulation as such.

I.   Wall signs shall not exceed one and one-half (1 ½ ) square foot per linear
foot of frontage of the façade the sign is mounted upon, up to the maximum size
allowed under Section
1143.12. Wall Signs may only be placed upon the building which houses the
business they advertise. In the case of multi-tenant structures, wall signs may
only be placed upon an exterior wall of the leased space which houses the
business they advertise. Wall Signs shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet above
grade and shall not extend above the parapet, if any, or roofline.
II.   An applicant shall be entitled to utilize two (2) Entrance Identification
Signs for a public entrance or service window so long as each Entrance
Identification Sign does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the size limitations
set forth in Section
1143.12.
III.   No single occupant structure or tenant space shall have more than two
(2) projecting or marquee signs and no more than one (1) projecting or marquee
sign per façade. Unless used as the Entrance Identification Sign, each
projecting or marquee sign placed upon a building shall reduce the total number
of allowable wall signs by one (1) for that occupant. Projecting and marquee
signs shall be at least eight (8) feet above grade, not more than fifteen (15)
feet above grade and shall not extend more than six (6) feet from the facade.

   1143.13  SIGNS IN UPTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.
   (a)   In order to complement, preserve and enhance the unique architectural
features of the Uptown Commercial District, it is the intent of this section to
apply different sign size, height, placement and illumination regulations to
the area bounded by the Anthony Wayne Trail, Gibbs Street, Allen Street and the
south corporate limits in order to encourage artistry and creativity in signage
in the Uptown Commercial District. Due to the density of the commercial
buildings, the lack of front and side yard setbacks, the configuration of the
commercial area, the emphasis on pedestrian traffic and its distinction from
other commercial areas in the City, the quality and quantity of on-premises
advertising contributes to the vitality, stability and overall character of the
Uptown Commercial District.
 
   (b)   The following regulations shall apply to signs in the Uptown
Commercial District:
      (1)   Approval of signs. Within the Uptown Commercial District, all new
signs and sign structures, or alterations of existing signs and sign structures
shall be approved by the Design Review Board prior to issuance of a permit.
Signs not conforming to these regulations must obtain a variance from the Board

in the amount of three-hundred-thousand dollars ($300,000) for bodily injury
and fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000) for damage to property shall have been
filed as herein required with the Building and Zoning Inspector. The insurance

damages or expenses of any kind whatsoever which may be suffered by the City,
or which it may be put to, or which may accrue against it by charging to or
recovering from the City from or by reason of the granting of permission to
erect such signs, or by reason of any act or things done under or by authority

for a specific site and shall terminate upon the final inspection and approval
of that installation.
   1143.18 ADDITIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   If any wall, projecting, sale or roof sign is suspended over a public street
or property, or if the vertical distance of such sign above the street is
greater than the horizontal distance from the sign to the street property line
or parapet wall and so located as to be able to fall or be pushed onto public
property, then the owner of such sign shall keep in force a public liability
insurance policy approved by the Solicitor in the amount of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) for injury to one person and one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) for injury to more than one person, and twenty-five thousand dollars

or damages to persons or property received by any person or persons through any
act or omission or negligence of such owner and/or the City and their
respective servants, agents or employees regarding such sign, and cause a
certification of such insurance to be issued to the City.

signs shall meet or exceed the requirements of Ohio Basic Building Code Article
29, Section 2907.0.
   1143.20 MAINTENANCE.
   All signs, together with their structural elements and supporting framework,
shall be kept in good repair and in a proper state of preservation to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Building and Zoning Inspector. The Building and
Zoning Inspector may order the removal of any sign, any portion of its
structural elements or its supporting framework that is not maintained in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter sixty (60) calendar days after
notice by certified mail is sent to the owner of such sign.
   1143.21 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
    (a)    It is the intent of this section to recognize that the elimination,
as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing signs that are not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, is as much a subject of health, safety,
and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the
provisions of this chapter. Sign regulations, which control the type, design,
size, location, illumination, and maintenance thereof, are established in order
to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
            (1)    To provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for
identifying businesses by their name within the City;
            (2)    To control the design of signs so that their appearance will
be aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings and an overall urban design
for the area;
            (3)    Promote pedestrian and traffic safety by minimizing sign
hazards and obstructions;
            (4)    To promote attractive and maintain high value residential
and commercial districts.
          In establishing these objectives, the City has determined that,
clearly articulated regulations and design standards will effectively promote
high quality signs that enhance the appearance, function, and character of the
community. All signs not conforming with the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared a nuisance. It is further declared that the regulations
contained in this chapter are the minimum regulation necessary to abate the
nuisance and to achieve the purposes of this chapter
  
   (b)    No nonconforming sign or sign structure:
            (1)    Shall be changed to another nonconforming sign;
            (2)    Shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used or
the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is designed for periodic
change of message;
           (3)    Shall be structurally altered so as to prolong the life of
the sign, or the structure or pole supporting the sign, or altered so as to
change the shape, size, type, or design of the sign;
         (4)    Shall have the face or faces changed when such sign is of a
type of construction to permit a change of face or faces;
         (5)    Shall be reestablished after the activity, business, or usage
to which it relates has been discontinued for ninety (90) calendar days or
longer; or
         (6)    Shall be reestablished after damage or destruction if the
estimated expense of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
appraised replacement cost of the sign as determined by the Director of Public
Safety.
   (c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, all graphics, signs,
marquees, canopies, and awnings rendered nonconforming by the provisions of
this chapter and permitted to continue, may be required to be removed, altered,
or remodeled to conform to the provisions of this chapter upon request of the
City Administrator or Urban Planning Manager.
(Ord. 024-2024. Passed 6-25-24.)
   1143.22 APPEAL FOR VARIANCE.
   A person aggrieved by an order, decision or requirement of the Building and
Zoning Inspector under this chapter may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
pursuant to Section
1105.02(c)(4) (Special Sign Variance).
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from and review
any order, requirement, decision or determination of this chapter. The Board
may grant a variance for a sign which does not comply with the provisions of
this chapter if, in addition to the requirements of Section
1105.02 (c)(2)(B), it determines that all of the following criteria are met:
   (a)   The particular sign will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter; and
   (b)   The sign will not be injurious to the immediate neighborhood or
adjacent land use; and
   (c)   The sign is sufficiently compatible with the architectural and design
character of the immediate neighborhood; and
   (d)   The sign will not be hazardous to passing traffic or otherwise
detrimental to the public safety and welfare.
   In granting such special permit, the Board shall specify the size, type and
location of the sign and impose such other reasonable terms, restrictions and
conditions as it may deem to be in the public interest.
(Ord. 057-2012. Passed 3-19-12.)
 
   1143.23 HIGHWAY SIGNAGE DISTRICT.

requirements in the area west of US 23/I 475, bounded by Salisbury to the
north, Monclova Road to the south, and Technology Drive and North Jerome Road
to the west, the Maumee Highway Signage District is created. In supplement to

the City for each application.
   (d)    That any applicable private association having design review over the
applicant's parcel, if applicable, approve the proposed sign design prior to
review by the City. The applicant shall state upon application whether private
association design review is applicable.
   (e)    The signage will only be placed on the side of the structure or yard
directly fronting on US 23/I 475 rights-of-way and will not exceed thirty three
percent (33%) of the square footage of the building elevation facing US 23/
I 475. If more than one permit is granted under this section, the total signage
area for both will not exceed thirty three percent (33%) of the square footage
of the building elevation facing US 23/I 475. The measurements in this section
will be by the method prescribed in Section
1143.02(a)(1). Banner area shall be calculated by the area contained within all
corners.    
   (f)    The Director of Public Safety shall find that the proposed signage is
unique and promotional in nature and not for the purpose of advertising retail
sale promotions or merely increasing the size of the company brand name as
otherwise limited by Chapter
1143. Examples of signage permitted under this section would be signage would
include but not be limited to: company marketing slogans secondary to the brand
name, award designations, congratulatory messages, and charitable sponsorships.
   (g)    All permits granted shall be for a period of six (6) months, subject

fee enumerated herein. In issuing a permit under this section, the Safety
Director may attach any conditions he may deem necessary to protect the health,
safety, and design integrity of the community. All signs shall be maintained in
a professional manner. Failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the
permit shall make the permit holder liable for any penalty under the Maumee
Planning and Zoning Code including immediate revocation of the permit.
   (h)    That permit holders agree that all signage granted under this section
is temporary in nature and further agree that such signage shall be taken down
at the permit holder's expense upon either the expiration of the Highway
Signage Permit or the termination of Section
1143.23.

   1145.02 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - LANDSCAPE PLANS AND SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)    Intent. Landscaping is necessary for the protection and enhancement
of the environment and for the continued vitality of all land uses in the City.
The intent of this section is to promote the public health, safety and welfare
by establishing minimum standards for the design, installation, and maintenance
of landscape improvement. The requirements of this section are intended to help
achieve a number of functional and environmental objectives such as:
      (1)    To promote the implementation of the city's comprehensive plan and
any related subarea plans;
      (2)    To aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by
contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration,
reduction of greenhouse gasses, groundwater recharge, and storm water runoff
retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and the reduction of
heat islands;
      (3)    To encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation;
      (4)    To assist in providing adequate light and air and in preventing
overcrowding of land;
      (5)    To provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the
city;
      (6)    To reduce the physical impact between adjacent land uses by
requiring complementary landscape treatments and providing a transitional area
adjacent to natural areas;
      (7)    To safeguard and enhance property values and to protect public and
private investment;
      (8)    To preserve, protect and restore the unique identity and
environment of the City of Maumee and preserve the economic base attracted to
the city by such factors;
      (9)    To define, articulate and integrate outdoor spaces, architectural
elements, and various site elements;
      (10)    To conserve energy, and to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare;
      (11)    To provide habitat for living things that might not otherwise
occur or be found in urban environs; and
      (12)    To provide reasonable standards to bring developed sites that
existed prior to the adoption of these standards into compliance with the
requirements contained herein.
      (13)    To offset the carbon "footprint" of buildings, structures,
parking, etc.
   (b)    Scope of Application.
      (1)    The requirements set forth in this section will apply to all uses,
lots, sites, and parcels that are developed or expanded following the effective
date of this section. No site plan that is reviewed in accordance with Chapter
1135, site plan review procedures and requirements, may be approved unless the
site plan shows required landscaping consistent with the provisions of this
section. Except for plans pertaining to one or two-family use, the landscape
plan shall be prepared by a Landscape Architect registered in the State of
Ohio.
      (2)    Where landscaping is required, a building permit will not be
issued until the required landscape plan is submitted and approved, and a
certificate of occupancy will not be issued by the chief building official (or
designee) unless provisions set forth in this section have been met or by
providing either a performance guarantee, as authorized by Section
1145.08; or by entering into a development agreement with the City stipulating
mile stones, costs and surety.
      (3)    The Zoning Administrator (or designee) will determine if the
existing landscaping or screening identified for preservation meets the intent
of this section (see subsection (d) of this section).
      (4)    Each landscape plan will be independently reviewed; the City
Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning Administrator (or designee)
may determine that there exist unique circumstances that would prevent the
installation of all or a portion of the required site landscaping, greenbelts,
buffer zones, and parking lot landscaping or detention/retention basin
landscaping requirements.
         A.   Such a determination must be made based upon criteria such as the
following:
            1.    Topography;
            2.    Existing woodlands, wetland, floodplain, drainage conditions
and poor soils;
            3.    Types and distance to adjacent land uses;
            4.    Dimensional conditions unique to the parcel;
            5.    Provision of adequate sight distances/clearance for motorists
and pedestrians;
            6.    Health, safety and welfare of the city;
            7.    Clearance from overhead utility lines and separation from
underground utilities; and
            8.    Accessibility to fire hydrants.
         B.   In return the applicant will be required to incorporate at least
one (1) of the following elements in the landscape plan:
            1.    The utilization of credits obtained by preserving existing
vegetation per the standards of subsection (c)(3)e.
            2.    Placing the required plant material elsewhere on the site, as
approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee);
            3.    Use of larger plant material (see subsection (c)(1) of this
section); or
            4.    An alternative proposed by the applicant in writing and
approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) (see subsection (g) of this
section).
      (5)    Landscape plan review required. A separate landscape plan
detailing the landscape changes consistent with the standards of this chapter
must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator (or designee) when:
         A.   A full site plan (FSP) is mandated, per the requirements of
Chapter
1135;
         B.   Where the building and/or parking area is being increased by at
least fifteen percent (15%) or reconstructed; or
         C.   The building is being changed to a more intense use and/or has an
existing legal non-conforming use or structure on the property, as determined
by the City Administrator and/or Zoning Administrator (or designee). The change
in use intensity must consider factors such as required parking, amount of
traffic generated, maximum building occupancy or change to a different use
category in the Building Code or Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Landscape Plan Specifications.
      (1)    Minimum requirements. The requirements contained in this section
are considered the minimum necessary to achieve the intent of this section, but
nothing herein will preclude the use of more extensive landscaping to further
improve the function, appearance and value of the property. The use of larger
plant material may be used to count towards the overall minimum planting
requirements (i.e. planting a twelve-foot tall evergreen when a six-foot is
required equals credit for one and one-half (1½) trees). All substitutions may
be allowed at the discretion of the City Administrator upon consultation with
the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)    Appropriate design professional requirement. The Zoning
Administrator (or designee) may require the landscape plans to be prepared by
an appropriate design professional due to the complexity of a project or
another compelling issue.
      (3)    Required information. The landscape plan must demonstrate that all
requirements of this section are met and must include the following
information:
         A.   Illustration of the location, spacing, species, size and root
ball of proposed plant material, including a plant schedule;
         B.   Separately identify compliance with the minimum numeric
requirements (rounded up) for site landscaping, greenbelts, buffer zones,
parking lot landscaping, and detention/retention ponds, rain gardens, rainwater
harvesting systems, and hydrologic separators which utilize swirl concentration
to separate trash, debris, sediment, and hydrocarbons from storm water runoff;
         C.   Clearly identify and delineate proposed planting beds and turf
grass areas;
         D.   Provide typical cross sections to illustrate views from adjacent
land uses, and the slope, height, and width of proposed berms or landscape
elements, as required by the Zoning Administrator (or designee);
         E.   Existing vegetation survey. Provide a survey of existing
vegetation in accordance with Section
1145.03 of this chapter which denotes the following:
            1.    Trees, noting their size (i.e., caliper or height) and type
(i.e., canopy, evergreen, or other ornamental);
            2.    Shrubs, noting their size and type/form (i.e., upright or
spreading evergreen or small or large deciduous);
            3.    Ground covers, noting their size/coverage and type (i.e.,
woody plants and vines or perennials); and
            4.    Identify the vegetation proposed for preservation and the
credits (if any) that will be claimed per the standards cited in Section
1145.03 of this chapter.
            5.   Additional information may be required by the Zoning
Administrator based on the existing conditions of a site. All credits to
landscaping standards shall be approved at the discretion the City
Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning Administrator.
         F.   Delineate the location of protective fencing around existing
vegetation identified for preservation per the standards of Section
1145.07 (d) of this chapter. A detail of all such fencing must be provided on
the landscape plan and meet the standards for such fencing included in Section
1145.07 of this chapter;

from the front property line.
         e.    Nothing but landscaping, including decorative fencing and
landscape features is allowed within the greenbelt.
         f.    A berm and/or masonry wall may be required as part, or in place
of, the buffer when deemed necessary by Zoning Administrator (or designee) to
meet the intent of subsection (e)(9) of this section and must conform to
Section
1145.07 of this Chapter.
         g.    The location may be modified by the Zoning Administrator (or
designee) at the discretion of the City Administrator (or designee) due to

      (4)    Mixing of species. The overall landscape plan may not contain more
than one-third (33.3%) of any one (1) plant species for each type of planting
specified in the Table of Landscape Standards (see subsection (d) of this
section). The use of native species and mixture of plants from the same plant
community is strongly encouraged.
      (5)    Trees not permitted. Various trees are not permitted for the
following reasons, although the Zoning Administrator (or designee) may allow
them when associated with an appropriate ecosystem, for historic preservation,
or another compelling objective:
         A.    Easily damaged or short lived. Including, but not limited to,
Black Locusts (Robinia pseudoacacia), Silver Maples (Acer saccharinum), and
various Poplars and Cottonwoods (Populus species);

foundations. Including, but not limited to, Weeping Willows (Salix babylonica)
and Silver Maples (Acer saccharinum); and
         E.    Unusually susceptible to disease or insects. Including, but not
limited to, American Elms (Ulmus americana) and various Ashes (Fraxinus
species).
      (6)    Planting beds.
         A.   Planting beds are clearly defined areas surrounding a single
tree, shrub, or grouping of trees and shrubs and may also include annuals,
various other types groundcovers, and mulch.
            There is no size limit for a planting bed as long as dedicated open
areas of mulch does not exceed one-third (33.3%) of its total area. Plant
coverage will be determined as follows:
            1.    An eighteen-inch radius circle around the trunk of a canopy
tree;
            2.    The drip-line of an ornamental tree or shrub at the time of
planting; and
            3.    Groupings of ground cover (excluding annuals) planted to
become dense and touch after one (1) complete growing season.
            Mulch is required in those areas at the time of planting, but only
half will be included when determining the percentage of a planting bed
dedicated to open areas of mulch.
         B.   Mulch must be maintained at a minimum of three (3) inches deep in
order to prevent weed growth and soil erosion and to retain soil moisture.
         C.   Material in planting beds shall be identified on the landscape
plan and approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) and maintained in
good condition.
         D.   Mulch and stone landscape beds will be permitted in parking
islands contained by curb and gutter.
      (7)   Top soil. Top soil must consist of a four (4) inch base for lawn
areas and an eight (8) to twelve (12) inch base within planting beds. This also
applies to berms.
      (8)    Proximity to utilities. Plant material cannot be located in a
manner that will interfere with or cause damage to underground or overhead
utility lines, public roads or other public facilities.
      (9)    Turf grass. Turf (i.e., lawn) grass must be planted in species
normally grown as permanent lawns in cool/humid area of the North American
Climate Zone. Turf grasses may be seeded or sodded. Only rolled sod, erosion
reducing net or suitable mulch may be used in swales or other areas susceptible
to erosion and must be staked where necessary for stabilization. When complete
sodding or seeding is not possible, nurse grass (i.e., fast growing temporary)
seed must be sown and mulched for immediate protection until permanent coverage
is achieved. Turf grass sod, seed, and top soil must be free of weeds and
noxious pests or disease. Areas of turf grass must be adequately irrigated for
the first two (2) growing seasons.
      (10)   Regulations pertaining to sight distance. All proposed landscaping
adjacent to the intersection of two or more streets or access drives must meet
the standards of Section
1145.06 of this Chapter.
   (f)    Minimum Standards for Installation, Irrigation and Maintenance.
      (1)    Timing of planting. All required plant materials must be planted
prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy by the chief building official (or
designee) in consultation with the Zoning Administrator (or designee). In the
event that the project is completed during a time of year when planting is
impractical, a performance guarantee, as authorized by Section
1145.08 of this Chapter, must be provided equal to the amount of installation
of the proposed landscaping.
      (2)    Completion of improvements. Tree stakes, guy wires, and tree wrap
installed to satisfy subsection (c)(3)H. of this section must be removed by the
date indicated on the landscape plan.
      (3)    Irrigation. Except in one or two-family uses, an automatic
irrigation system shall be required for all landscaped areas and must be
indicated on the landscape plan and approved by the Zoning Administrator (or
designee).
      (4)    Maintenance. The owner of the property is responsible for the
regular maintenance of all landscaping. Landscaped areas and plant materials
required by this section must be kept free from refuse and debris. Plant
materials, including turf grass (i.e., lawns), must be maintained in a healthy
growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance per the intent of the
approved site plan. Additionally, all plantings approved as part of a site plan
must be maintained in perpetuity or an amended landscape plan must be submitted
for consideration by the Zoning Administrator (or designee). However, if any
required plant material dies or becomes diseased, it must be replaced.
Replacement must be within thirty (30) days unless an extended time period is
necessary due to weather in which case a written request may be submitted and
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) prior to its potential
authorization.
   (g)    Proposal by Applicant for Complying with Requirement. 
      (1)    Proposal by applicant. If the applicant demonstrates that
compliance with this section is not feasible on the property, in lieu of
complying with all of a part of the specific requirements set forth in this
section for landscaping, the applicant may propose in writing an alternative
means of compliance. Subject to approval by the City Administrator, upon
consultation with the Zoning Administrator (or designee), for a particular
property and circumstance, such alternative may include, by way of example,
installing landscape materials in the immediate area of the property being
developed or paying moneys into the city tree fund in an amount by multiplying
the total quantity of plantings that would not be installed by the cost per
plant. That proposal must include a timetable for performance, and state
whether a performance guarantee (see Section
1145.08 of this chapter) would be filed to secure such performance.
      (2)    Review by the Zoning Administrator (or designee). The Zoning
Administrator (or designee) will review the written proposal of the applicant
and determine whether the proposal would be accepted in place of the landscape
requirements that would not be completed in accordance with this section. Any
deviation shall be a component of a required development agreement approved by
the City Administrator if and to the extent the Zoning Administrator (or
designee) is satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that it would not be
feasible to fully comply with the landscaping requirements in this section, the
determination by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) on whether to approve
an applicant's proposal will be based on the standard of most closely achieving
the intent of the ordinance, to the extent reasonably feasible. The expense of
complying with this section shall not be a basis of consideration by the Zoning
Administrator (or designee). Any bonding to be a part of the proposal shall be
subject to review by the City Attorney, and shall conform with customary
bonding requirements for development in the city.
      (3)    Effect of approval. If the applicant's written proposal is
approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee), the proposal shall be
deemed to be a regulation required under this section, and a failure to comply

to the general operating fund or used for any purpose other than undertaking
the planting of trees and shrubs in the city.
   (i)   Landscape Requirements for Parking Areas: Landscaping within parking
areas, including both ground cover or upright plant material, is necessary not
only to reduce the generation of heat and water runoff, but to break up the
expanse of paved areas. The use of parking islands or peninsulas strategically
placed throughout the parking area is required in accordance with the following
specific requirements and all other requirements of this Chapter and Chapter
966 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (1)   All parking lots must include adjoining landscaping strips at least
four (4) feet in width along each side and rear lot line. Such landscaping
strips shall include hedges or plantings of shrub material which meet the
requirements of subsection (e) of this section.

spaces, a minimum area equal to one parking space for each twenty-five (25)
spaces (or fraction thereof) shall be provided and shall be landscaped and
permeable in accordance with this Chapter and Chapter
966 of the Codified Ordinances. Landscaped islands shall be irrigated. Said 1
parking space landscape requirement shall be in addition to all other landscape
requirements.
      (3)   All permanent landscape screened areas shall be maintained in a
healthy growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance.
      (4)   All screen planting and fencing required under the provisions of
this section shall be adequately protected so as to prevent damage thereto by
automobiles parking in such parking areas.
      (5)   When it is proposed that a parking area provide substantially more
parking than is permitted by applicable sections of this ordinance, additional
landscaping shall be provided to help mitigate impact of large amounts of hard
surfaces. The specific amount of area that is to be landscaped and permeable
shall be at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator and may be determined as
follows:

   1145.03 PRESERVING EXISTING VEGETATION.
   (a)    Preserving Existing Vegetation.
      (1)    Intent. The intent of this section is to preserve existing
vegetation unless there are no other site design alternatives. Where healthy
plant material exists on a site prior to its development or redevelopment, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator (or designee) or the Planning
Commission, variations from the landscape requirements contained in this
Chapter may be approved to allow credit for such plant material if such
adjustment is in keeping with the intent of this section and is further
approved by the City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)    Inspection. All existing vegetation must be inspected by the
Zoning Administrator (or designee) to ensure the vegetation is high quality and
will fulfill the requirements of this section.
      (3)    Credit for trees. Credit for tree preservation may be applied at
the discretion of the City Administrator, upon consultation with the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) at the following rate:
         A.   For preserved trees of equal to or greater than twelve (12)
inches in caliper, a credit of two (2) trees may be permitted but in no case
shall the credit reduce trees required in the terrace or parking lots. No
credit shall be afforded for a tree that is considered invasive.
         B.   For preserved trees less than twelve (12) inches in caliper, a
credit of one (1) tree may be permitted but in no case shall the credit reduce
trees required in the terrace or parking lots. No credit shall be afforded for
a tree that is considered invasive.
      (4)    Credit for shrubs. No credit shall be considered for shrub
preservation
      (5)    Removed credit trees. In the event healthy plant material credited
towards required plantings are removed, damaged, or destroyed, as determined by
the Zoning Administrator (or designee), they must be replaced at a rate of two
(2) to one (1) with new plant material meeting the standards of this section.
      (6)    Mitigation. Every attempt must be made to preserve healthy mature
existing vegetation. In the event that an existing tree with greater than a
four-inch caliper or eight (8) feet tall is removed when there are obvious
alternatives to its removal, as determined by the zoning administrator (or
designee), all such trees must be replaced at a ratio of 2 for 1. Each new tree
must have a caliper of no less than three (3) inches or a height of no less
than six (6) feet. (Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1145.04 TRASH CONTAINER SCREENING.
   Trash containers designed to service more than one (1) residential unit or
to service a nonresidential structure shall not be located in a front yard and
shall be screened on four (4) sides by one (1) gate, walls or fences and
natural vegetation or an acceptable combination of these elements approved at
the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. Material used in the construction
of the dumpster screening shall be of like, or complimentary, material to the
main structure. Gates shall be constructed of sturdy material and shall not
have a supporting structure constructed of wood or plastic. The height of such
screening shall be at least six (6) feet or six (6) inches taller than the
trash container, whichever is greater. The maximum height of walls and fences
shall not exceed ten (10) feet. Vegetation shall have a minimum opaqueness of
seventy-five percent (75%) at all times within two (2) years of planting.
Vegetation shall be a variety and size that will attain six (6) feet in height
within two (2) years of planting and shall meet all other requirements of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1145.05 SERVICE COURTS, STORAGE AREAS, AND LOADING DOCKS.
   Service courts, storage areas, and loading docks shall be screened along the
entire rear lot line and side lot lines as necessary. Screening shall consist
of walls, hedges, fences, vegetation, or an acceptable combination of these
elements approved at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, provided that
screening must be at least six (6) feet in height.
(Ord. 093-2020. Passed 7-6-20.)
   1145.06 VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS.
   When a driveway intersects a public right-of-way or when the subject
property abuts the intersection of public rights-of-way, all fences, walls,
hedges, screens, structures, plantings or other landscaping within the site
clearance triangle areas described below must permit unobstructed cross-
visibility. Shrubs and groundcover located in a site clearance triangle may not
be permitted to grow to a height of more than two and one-half (2½) feet above
the grade at the edge of the pavement. Portions of required berms located
within sight clearance triangle cannot exceed a height of two and one-half (2½)
feet above the pavement grade at the edge of the pavement. Canopy trees may be
maintained in this area provided that all branches are trimmed to maintain a
clear vision for a vertical height of ten (10) feet above the roadway surface.
Other landscaping, except turf grass or ground cover maintained at a height of
two and one-half (2½) feet, cannot be located closer than three (3) feet from
the edge of a driveway.
   The site clearance triangles referred to above are:
   (a)    The area formed at the corner intersection of a public right-of-way
and a driveway, two (2) sides of the triangle area being ten (10) feet in
length measured along the right-of-way line and access drive line and the third
side being a line connecting these two (2) sides. For the purpose of plantings
located in the lawn extension/terrace, the site clearance triangle extends
beyond the right-of-way line to the curb/edge of pavement at an angle
perpendicular to both of those lines.
   (b)    The area formed at a corner intersection of two (2) public right-of-
way lines, the two (2) sides of the triangular area being twenty (20) feet in
length measured along the abutting public right-of-way lines and the third side
being a line connecting these two (2) sides. For the purpose of plantings
located in the lawn extension/terrace, the site clearance triangle extends
beyond the right-of-way line to the curb/edge of pavement at an angle
perpendicular to both of those lines.

   1145.07 STANDARDS FOR WALLS, LANDSCAPE BERMS, AND TEMPORARYFENCES.
   All walls and landscape berms of any nature, type or description located in
the City of Maumee must conform to the following regulations:
   (a)    Approval Required. The erection, construction or alteration of any
wall or other type of protective barrier must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator (or designee) as to conformance with the requirements of the
zoning district and this section.
   (b)    General Wall and Landscape Berm Standards.
      (1)    Wall or landscape berm height measurement. The height of a wall or
landscape berm will be measured using the following method:
         A.   The permitted height of all walls and landscape berms will be
measured from the ground elevation adjacent to the wall or berm, as determined
by the Zoning Administrator (or designee).
         B.   Where elevations differ by more than four (4) feet within ten
(10) feet of side or rear lot lines, the Zoning Administrator (or designee) may
allow additional wall or landscape berm height for the property at the lower
elevation.
         C.   The permitted height of walls will not be measured from an area
of the ground that has been built-up or constructed in a manner that would have
the effect of allowing a taller wall than permitted by this chapter (e.g. the
height of walls erected on a berm will be measured from the finished grade
adjacent to the edge of the berm).
      (2)    Masonry walls. Masonry walls must be constructed of the same or
complementary building material to that of the principal structure and must be
un-pierced (except for pedestrian and vehicular connections) and have a
decorative cap. Cement or slag blocks will not be permitted.
      (3)    Decorative fences, walls and landscape berms. Fences, walls, and
landscape berms which are two and a one-half (2½) feet or less in height are
considered decorative and do not require a permit.
      (4)    Landscape berms. Where provided, landscape berms must conform to
the following standards.
         A.   Berms must comply with the height restrictions for walls in
subsection (c) of this section, but in no case may they be maintained at a
continuous height. All berms must be undulating and include gaps where deemed
necessary.
         B.   Sides of the berm must be constructed with slopes no steeper than
one (1) foot vertical for each five (5) feet horizontal unless otherwise
approved by the Zoning Administrator.
         C.   In measuring slope and height, grade elevation will be the
average ground elevation adjacent to the proposed berm.
         D.   Side slopes must be protected from erosion by sod, seed or other
living ground cover. If slopes are seeded, they must be protected until the
seed germinates and a permanent lawn is established.
    (c)    Walls in Commercial and Industrial Districts.
      (1)    No wall may exceed eight (8) feet in height, unless otherwise
approved by the Zoning Administrator (or designee).
      (2)    No walls may be located in the required and addressed front yard.
       (3)    All walls must be ornamental in nature and should be made of
brick, stone, and similar replication of these materials unless a varied
material is approved by the Zoning Administrator for the purpose of conforming
to architectural standards elsewhere on the property.
      (4)    No walls are permitted within the required site clearance
triangles (see Section
1145.06).
   
   (d)   Temporary Protective Fencing Associated with Construction Projects.
During construction, protective fencing must be placed around existing
vegetation proposed for preservation and other site elements which cannot be
easily removed or stored.
      (1)    Proposed protective fencing must be clearly identified on the
landscape plan. The Zoning Administrator (or designee) must also determine
compliance with these standards.
      (2)    Protective fencing cannot be located closer that one (1) foot
outside the perimeter of the following, as identified on the landscape plan:
         A.   The drip lines of existing trees and shrubs; and
         B.   Planting beds and other site element.
      (3)    Materials.
         A.   Fencing must be comprised of high density polyethylene mesh
fabric or chain link with a nominal two-inch diamond design not less than
forty-eight (48) inches above grade.
         B.   Steel posts must be at least eight (8) feet long and at least one
(1) inch wide with a nominal weight of one (1) pounds per foot exclusive of the
anchor plate. Steel posts must include an anchor plate and be notched, studded
or have other means for holding the fabric in place on the post.
         C.   Fencing must be attached to each post with at least five (5)
eleven (11) gauge galvanized or aluminum coated wire fasteners.
      (4)    Installation.
         A.   Install steel posts a maximum of ten (10) feet apart. Steel posts
must be installed plumb with a post driver into undisturbed earth. Bent or
broken posts are prohibited. Line posts shall have a minimum bury depth of
thirty (30) inches. Corner posts shall have a minimum bury depth of forty-two
(42) inches and must be braced as necessary to ensure that the posts remains
plumb and the protective fencing remains taut once it is attached.
         B.   Install line posts with the anchor plate turned to parallel with
the fencing. Install corner posts with the steel plate turned to cross the
inside of the angle formed by the fence runs on each side of the corner post.
         C.   Stretch fence fabric taut and fasten to each post using wire
fasteners. Fasteners must be spaced no greater than twelve (12) inches apart on
the steel posts with the bottom fastener being located no more than two (2)
inches above the ground.
      (5)    Maintenance. The temporary fencing must be regularly inspected and
any broken sections of fence must be immediately removed and replaced. Bent or
leaning posts must be removed, replaced and anchoring methods improved so that
the posts remain plumb. Fence fasteners must be visually inspected and replaced
should any be found to have come undone or to have torn through the protective
fencing.
      (6)    Duration. The installation and removal of temporary fencing
associated with a construction project must coincide with the start and
completion of the construction project.

all or part of such area shall either be dedicated to the proper public agency
or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby, within a specified period by a
purchase or other means and an agreement shall be entered into between the
subdivider and the proper public agency regarding the time and method of
acquisition and the cost thereof, or an agreement shall be made by the
appropriate public agency upon an alternate location that is satisfactory to
the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding natural
and cultural features such as scenic spots, watercourses and historic sites.
   1165.09 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Whenever any stream or surface drainage course is located in an area
that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall dedicate an adequate easement
along each side thereof, for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping,
improving or protecting the same for drainage, parkway or recreational use. The
official plan shall be used as a guide for such dedication.
   (b)   Easements of at least five (5) feet in width shall be provided on each
side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where sideline easements

set marking will be permitted; provided, however, that exact off-set courses
and distances are shown on the subdivision plat.
      (3)   One such monument shall be placed at each change in direction of
the boundary, and one such monument shall also be placed at the beginning and
end of curves, on one side of the street.

in residential zoning districts and five feet (5') in commercial and industrial
zoning districts shall conform to construction specifications of the City. Such
sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all public primary and
secondary, half, and minor streets. Curb ramps shall be constructed from the
sidewalk to the street to service all sides of an intersection in accordance
with the then current standards established by the Federal Government under the
American with Disabilities Act.

   (g)   Water Supplies.
      (1)   Where an approved public water supply is within reasonable access
of the subdivision, water facilities shall be installed in accordance with all
applicable requirements of the political subdivision having jurisdiction over
the same.
      (2)   When a subdivision is located where no approved public water supply
is reasonably accessible or procurable, the subdivider shall provide wells or a
private water supply in such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water
will be available to each lot in the subdivision.
   (h)   Sanitary Sewers.
      (1)   Where public sanitary sewers are within reasonable proximity of the

pipe as required for the adequate handling of storm run-off.
      (3)   When lots are to be provided with septic tanks, the storm drainage
invert shall be at least three (3) feet below the natural ground level in the
vicinity of the septic tank in order to facilitate subsurface drainage,
provided that the effluent discharge shall not be connected to the storm
drainage.
   1165.11 VARIANCE.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape, or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Regulations would result in
substantial hardship or injustice, such requirements may be varied or modified
so that the subdivider may subdivide his property in a reasonable manner,
provided that the public welfare and interest of the City and surrounding areas
are thoroughly protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations
are enforced.

1180.01 through
1180.21, except as otherwise provided herein. The City Administrator may
delegate any or all of the duties hereunder to the Director of Service or other
designee.

seeks to occupy or use the rights-of-way to operate a system located in the

way, shall apply for, and obtain a certificate of registration pursuant to
Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21. Any person owning, operating, or maintaining a system in the rights-
of-way without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under
a permit, license or franchise issued by the City prior to the effective date
of Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21 shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration from the city,
unless exempted as set forth herein. Application will consist of providing the
information set forth herein and as reasonably required by the City
Administrator.
   
   (c)   No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the
effective date of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21, no person shall construct or perform any work on or in or use any
system or any part thereof located on or in any rights-of-way without first
obtaining a certificate of registration. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall pay a minimum fine of
five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation of this code. Each day shall
constitute a separate offense if construction is commenced without a
Certificate of Registration.
   
   (d)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The following entities are not obligated to obtain a certificate of
registration: the City (exclusive of its contractors which shall be required to
obtain and maintain a certificate of registration); and resellers of services
that do not own any system or facilities in the rights-of-way.
      (2)   The following entities are required to participate in the
certificate of registration process but shall be exempt from the financial
obligations of the application fee and the registration maintenance fee: a

providing only cable service and operating pursuant to a valid cable franchise,

providing only video service and operating pursuant to a valid video service
authorization issued in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1332.24. In addition, cable
operators shall be exempt from any requirement of the certificate of
registration process that is specifically exempted by state law.
   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a right-of-way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or noncomplying portion of
such system; and/or prosecuting the violator and/or assessing any costs
incurred in the inspection, removal and/or correction of any improperly
installed system and assessment of penalties and fines.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights-of-way, the City shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the rights-of-way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the City. No
provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 as creating a special duty to any provider.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the City shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the provider's
obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this section and any
other sections in this Code have been lawfully assumed by another applicant
and/or provider; or
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions
to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way capacity. Such
proposal must be approved by the Director of Service; or
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Director of Service must approve said proposal; or
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the City within a reasonable amount of time if
the City believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         E.   Submit to the city within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with Ohio R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the City. If a provider proceeds under this
clause, the City may, at its option where lawful:
            (i)   Purchase the facilities; or
            (ii)   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted, require
the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for
reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance.
         B.   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of Ohio R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the City requires a provider to remove unused facilities in any
rights-of-way, the City shall make reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the rights-of-
way. If the City abates the nuisance, it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,
those methods set forth in Maumee Codified Ordinances or Ohio R.C. § 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the City, for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate of
registration and in accordance with this Code. The rights to occupy the right-
of-way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two (2) or
more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way
so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21. Collocating providers may file a joint application for a construction
permit. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from
complying with any provisions of Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21 or other applicable law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents to
the City. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere
with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires,
fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever
under the management or control of the City.
   (j)   The City Administrator may propose, and Council may adopt (and from
time to time amend) the Rules and Regulations regarding Chapter
1180, Construction standards and occupancy requirements of the Right of Way.
Such Rules and Regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of any
provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in any
way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of Rules and
Regulations increasing Fees; the requiring of the placement of Facilities in
designated portions of the Rights of Way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of Facilities; or the requiring of joint builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the Rules and Regulations, the City of Maumee shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via United States Regular Mail, to each Provider who holds a then
current Certificate of Registration. Each Provider shall then have thirty (30)
days following the date of the City of Maumee's mailing to provide written
comment regarding the proposed language to the City of Maumee. At least forty-
five (45) days, but not more than sixty (60) days following the date of the
City of Maumee's mailing, the City of Maumee shall schedule and hold a meeting,
to make available a forum at which all then current Providers may address any
questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new
Rules and Regulations to the City of Maumee. The City of Maumee Administrator
shall, following said meeting and the review of the Providers' comments and
suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and Regulations in a manner that best
serves the City of Maumee, for approval by City of Maumee Council.

like kind and quality; and
      (7)   Warrant that all worker facilities, conditions, and procedures that

any way altering any street or area in the rights-of-way as defined in this
chapter. The City shall notify the providers of the city's date to begin the
process at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of said activities;
in field identifying facilities:
         A.   Providers shall identify all facilities that are within the
affected rights-of-way using customary industry standards and distinct
identification; and
         B.   Facilities will be so marked as to identify the provider
responsible for said facilities consistent with the Rules and Regulations for
Making Openings in a Public Way; and
         C.   Should any such marking interfere with the facilities function,
create a safety problem, or violate any safety code, alternative methods of
marking the facilities may be approved by the Director of Service.
         D.   All marking should be clearly readable from the ground and be
consistent with the Rules and Regulations for Making Openings in a Public Way.
         E.   If necessary, relocate their facilities on a permanent basis, if
said ongoing use or maintenance of their facilities in that right of way would
interfere with traffic, safety, or use of the street.
         F.   Determine whether there is an alternative location that the
conduit, pipe, line, or other utility may be placed, such as in an alley or
side street which will not be as disruptive to traffic or pedestrians during

position at variance with utility corridors established by the Director of
Service shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding
normal maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position
within the rights-of-way. Existing underground facilities located within a
designated utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or
alternative portions of the rights-of-way unless they are in conflict with an
actual or proposed public improvement project or if the Director of Service
requires their relocation when the provider is replacing facilities or when the
current location poses potential harm or unnecessary risks to the public,
business or the City. The above requirements may be waived by the Director of
Service in limited circumstances, for good cause shown including, but not
limited to, consideration of such factors as: the remaining economic life of
the facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the
provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Director of Service to
the City Administrator.
      (3)   The Director of Service shall make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way as set forth

manner that interferes with vehicular or pedestrian travel on such rights-of-
way.
      (6)   Unless otherwise stated in a certificate of registration or permit,
all facilities within the rights-of-way shall be constructed and located in
accordance with the Maumee Codified Ordinances and with the following
provision:
   Whenever existing facilities that have been traditionally located overhead
are located in whole or in part underground in a certain area within the City,
a provider who desires to place its facilities in the same area must locate its
facilities underground. Whenever a provider is required to locate or relocate
facilities underground within a certain area of the City of Maumee, every
Provider with facilities within the same area of Maumee shall concurrently
relocate their facilities underground. (Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
   1180.04  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each provider shall, at the
time of initial application and using its best efforts by January 1 of each
following year, file a construction and major maintenance plan with the Service
Department. Such construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for
all geographical areas requested by the Director of Service, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the City. It shall be submitted using
a format(s) mutually agreeable to the provider and the City and shall contain
the information determined by the Director of Service to be necessary to
facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in
the rights-of-way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include,
but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction
projects for the next calendar year, if none are scheduled or anticipated then
the plan shall so state. In an effort to assist providers with the completion
of their annual construction and major maintenance plan, the Service
Department, on or before November 1 of each year, will send each provider's
system representative a descriptive narrative (and any mapping information
reasonably available) for all the planned right-of-way improvements and/or
scheduled maintenance that the City then currently intends to undertake during
the next calendar year.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of
registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the City of the
number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's
system then currently occupies and begin submitting to the City all information
that currently exists and which can be provided regarding the location of its
facilities in the right-of-way in hard copy or in the most advanced format
(including, but not limited to, electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
City. Unless otherwise required a provider shall have up to one (1) year from
the date of the provider's initial filing of an application for a certificate
of registration to completely submit all the mapping data for a provider's
system in the entire geographical area of the City which it owns or over which
it has control that are located in any rights-of-way of the City in the most
advanced format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital
format) then currently being used by the provider that is then currently
capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form)
by the City. Any time after the issuance of a certificate of registration, and
upon the reasonable request of the Director of Service, a provider shall be
required to provide to the City any additional location information for any
facilities which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any
rights-of-way of the City required by the City. Any and all actual direct,
incidental and indirect costs incurred by the City during the process of
reviewing, inputting and/or converting a provider's mapping information to
comport with the City's then current standard format (whether electronic or
otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the
provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within sixty (60) days of receipt
of an invoice shall subject an applicant or provider to revocation of its
certificate of registration and the penalties of this chapter. Further, each
provider that has been issued a certificate of registration shall accurately
inform the City on or before each subsequent January 1 of the number of miles
(rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system then
occupied as of the immediately previous December 1. The Director of Service
may, in the future, adopt additional specifications and further define or
modify the mapping data requirements under this section for reasons including,
but not limited to, changes in technology or the law regarding public
disclosure of a provider's mapping information. When the City modifies and/or
amends the mapping data requirements, the City shall use best efforts to avoid
unreasonably increasing the burden to the providers that may be associated with
satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When the mapping requirements are
amended, each provider shall be served with a copy of the new specifications or
modifications by regular U.S. Mail to the system representative identified in
each certificate of registration; provided, however, that any failure of any
provider to actually receive such notice shall not in any way affect the
validity or enforceability of said specifications or modifications.
            The City of Maumee reserves the right to create its own public way
inventory map and may recover the cost of creation of a map through the
registration process.
          A provider shall notify the City of Maumee if the provider believes
that any specific document or portion of a document being submitted to the City
of Maumee is exempt from the public records disclosure requirements of Ohio
R.C. 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and indicate the specific
document or portion of a document that the provider believes is exempt from
disclosure. The notification shall include the legal basis for the claimed
exemption, including the applicable statutory reference and any additional
information necessary to make a determination of exemption for each specific
document or portion of a document. If a public records request is made for
documents submitted by a provider, the City of Maumee will consider the written
notification in making its own independent determination of whether a specific
document or portion of a document is exempt from disclosure.
(Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)

providers and other persons operating a system or otherwise using and occupying
the rights-of-way in accordance with the following process and formula:
      (1)   The City by January 1 of each year shall calculate all actual and
incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management, administration, and

for in Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21. 
      (2)   Providers and applicants shall accurately inform the City upon
application for a certificate of registration and on or before each subsequent

way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous December
1.
      (3)   The City shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers.
      (4)   The City shall divide the calculated costs by the total number of
miles of right-of-way reported as being used or occupied by all providers to
arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The City shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation by
the per-mile cost calculation .The product shall be a provider's then current
annual registration maintenance fee.
      (6)   The City shall perform its annual calculation of registration
maintenance fees following receipt of the providers required January 1 mileage
report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers on or
about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due thirty (30) days
following receipt.

of-way they use and/or occupy included in the calculations, but shall not be
required to contribute to the recovery of rights-of-way costs as defined by
Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21 with the exception of permit costs.
   (b)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid by February 1 of
each calendar year. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the certificate of
registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of City property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21. The registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or
other assessment except as specifically provided in Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21, or as required by applicable law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the City by March 1 of the year the fee is due,
the provider shall pay a monthly late charge of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance for each month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
 
   1180.06  OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Reports. Upon reasonable request of the City Administrator or Director

exercise all reasonable legal protections so as not to publicly disclose to any
third party such information unless required by law. The City shall, following

(Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
 
    1180.15  CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION, AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial construction, repair,
extension, or relocation of facilities in the rights-of-way, except for minor
repair or maintenance or relocations requested or caused by a third party
(excluding the City) or another permittee, a permittee shall conduct a utility
engineering study on the proposed route of construction expansion or
relocation. Where such construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by
a third party, every permittee located within the rights-of-way at issue or
involved with the work shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any
other permittee or person who is directed by the City to perform the required
utility engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, catch basins, utility access holes, maintenance holes, sewers,
valve boxes, culverts, signs, poles, trees, shrubs, landscaping, railroads,
buildings, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs. Show any item
or feature that may be affected by the proposed work.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Director of Service , a permittee shall also record
and identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights-of-way
along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the right-of-way but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in and on the construction permittee's proposed system route
maps, construction plans, plan sheets or computer aided drafting and design
(CADD) files, or other data files in a format compatible with that used by the
City.
         E.   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted
permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive digging methods,
such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified to determine as
precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial position,
composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting underground
facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the apparent
conflict. A permittee shall not excavate more than a three (3) feet by three
(3) feet square hole in the rights-of-way to complete this task.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
   (b)   Copy to City. Upon completion of the tasks described in the
application, the construction permittee shall plot and incorporate the data on
the permittee's proposed system route maps, construction plans, plan sheets or
CADD files, or other data files in the best and most advanced format available
to both the City and the provider and deliver a copy to the Service Department.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Director of Service the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the City.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
this Chapter.
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21, or unless the Director of Service waives any of the requirements of
this section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a permittee shall be
required to submit a written construction schedule to the City five (5) working
days before commencing any work in or about the rights-of-way, and shall
further notify the City not less than one working day in advance of any
excavation in the rights-of-way. This section shall apply to all situations
with the exception of circumstances (emergency situations) and (minor
maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the City's Design Guidelines-Creating a Quality
Environment.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new, replaced, repaired, or additional facilities within the rights-of-way. In
making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
City and county plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among providers. The City reserves the right to
require placement of new, repaired or replacement facilities in a different
right of way or a right of way corridor, or in existing conduit or require co-
location on existing poles or structures, or new poles if deemed necessary by
the City.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible, shall utilize trenchless technology, including, but not limited to,
horizontal drilling, directional boring, and micro tunneling. In addition, all
cable, wire, or fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights-of-way
pursuant to Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no
cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions.
      (1)   The City may grant a special exception to the requirements of this
Chapter if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
         A.   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare.
         B.   Permittee demonstrates that the there is a significantly
increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on the permittee's
construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the requirement
actually or effectively inhibits the ability of the permittee to provide
services in the City. Short term economic burdens and short term impacts shall
not qualify for relief. The City may consider the long term impact on any
project, including the necessity to avoid construction or repairs, or
replacement of facilities in the future on main roads, damage to other
infrastructure and other factors as set forth herein or other Maumee Codified
Ordinances
         C.   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably or
unlawfully discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
         D.   The requirements requested by the City herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any benefit or
potential benefit to the City.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities on property owned by
the City of Maumee or in the right-of-way whenever the City finds it necessary
to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the City requests
removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable construction
permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the
rights-of-way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal
or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated,
then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or comparable
size. The Director of Service may request relocation and/or removal in order to
prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of vehicular
or pedestrian travel over the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
rights-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have an easement in such vacated portion or excess
portion.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the City,
within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order, or if a provider fails
to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair of the
rights-of-way of the City, within twelve (12) months thereafter, then, to the
extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title, and interest to the facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title, and interest in the facilities to another person for operation;
or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense,
by another person; however, the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the provider,
and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each
provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be
responsible to mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all
its facilities and notify the City of Maumee Administrator of said marking so
said locations can be reviewed before excavation is commenced.
      (2)   All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor and Maumee officials in an effort to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Maumee
Codified Ordinances or other specifications as may be set forth by the City,
and must inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the
same condition for twelve (12) months thereafter. If a permittee is unable to
timely complete the restoration of rights-of-way due to unreasonable inclement
weather conditions, the permittee shall complete the restoration of the rights-
of-way as soon as weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said
completion notify the City.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the City may
choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or alternatively
to restore the rights-of-way itself if the permittee has in the past not abided
by requirements of Sections
 1180.01 through
 1180.21.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-
way, the permittee shall at the time of application for a construction permit
post a construction bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
restoration of the rights-of-way, the City determines that the rights-of-way
have been professionally restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be
released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in
exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular
method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the
rights-of-way that would otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may
include, but are not limited to, patching the affected area, replacement of the
rights-of-way base at the affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling,
overlay and/or street reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way
affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the right-of-way, itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12)-month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Service Department, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using
the method required by the Service Department. Weather permitting, said work
shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from
the Service Department.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may do such
work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30)
days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any
other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon
any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all
legal and equitable remedies.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay,
or the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by the permittee
and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities or replacing any trees in the rights-of-way which it or its
facilities damage or which are removed as part of any project. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of
another provider or trees caused during the City's response to an emergency
occasioned by that provider's facilities.
   
   (m)   Rights-of-Way Vacation.
      (1)   If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of
a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the provisions of Maumee Codified
Ordinances or Ohio R.C. § 723.04.1.
      (2)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's
facilities; and
         A.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the
provider must pay the relocation costs; or
         B.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City or other
person or persons, for a public purpose of the City, the provider or permittee
must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City, the
provider or permittee.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with specifications as promulgated by the City and in accordance
with the minimum standards set forth in these provisions or in the Maumee
Codified Ordinances.
   (o)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the Service Department.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety,
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the permit and/or this Code.
      (3)   The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions,
or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee.
An order may be appealed to the Director of Service . The decision of the
Director of Service may be appealed to the City Administrator whose decision
shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance of the
order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Service that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the Director of Service may revoke the permit.
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, easements, and authority
to use the right of way and to pay all fees required by any other City, county,
state, or federal laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all State of Ohio
and Federal laws, including the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency.
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a right-of-way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.

a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Director of Service may deny a permit
in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.
      (1)   The Director of Service, in his or her discretion, may consider one
or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-
way; and/or
         C.   The availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in
other rights-of-way for the proposed facilities; and/or
         D.   The applicability of Sections
1180.01 through
 1180.21 or other regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of
facilities in the rights-of-way; and/or
         E.   The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of its certificate of registration, Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way;
and/or
         G.   The condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and/or
         I.   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of Sections
 1180.01 through
 1180.21. or, if applicable, any other law.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Chapter, the Director of
Service with the approval of the City Administrator may issue a permit in any
case where the permit is necessary:
         A.   To prevent substantial, long term, economic hardship to a
customer of the permit applicant, if established by credible evidence
satisfactory to the City; or
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Service of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary using the guidelines set forth herein and generally accepted
practices in order to respond to the emergency. Within five (5) business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Director of Service, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the
event that the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's
facilities, the City shall use best efforts to contact the provider, or the
system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in,

of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 and pay any other fees or penalties set forth herein.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke
any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of the
permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or

certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued; or
         H.   Any action or plan by the Permittee, or its contractors or agents
which hinders, disrupts, or delays other construction projects planned or in
progress by the City of Maumee, its contractors or any other permittee's
ongoing or planned project.
      (2)   If the Director of Service determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
condition of the permit, the Director of Service shall serve a written demand
upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Service may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Director of Service
with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Service, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Service , or the permittee's
failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the
permit.
      (4)   If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will
not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation. (Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
   1180.18  CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the City and the county, shall deposit with
the Director of Service an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or
surety bond in an amount determined by the Director of Service to be
appropriate based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction
default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of
the general public, the Director of Service shall serve written notice to the
construction permittee detailing the construction default, problem or
deficiency. If the Director of Service determines that correction or repair of
the construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not
been substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the date
following service and notification and detailing the construction default,
problem or deficiency, then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction
permittee by the Director of Service.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and
continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a provider's facilities have

deposit with the Director of Service and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal to or greater than fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the Director of Service shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five (5) calendar days after

notice shall be provided to the provider by the Director of Service.
   (c)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the construction bond required, and the

statement to the Director of Service requesting to self-bond. If approval to
self-bond is granted, a provider shall assure the City that such self-bonding
shall provide the City with no less protection and security than would have
been afforded to the City by a third-party surety providing provider with the
types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above-named sections. This statement
shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and

         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and

contribute, and regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence
of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action,
judgment, injury or damage; and
         C.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm, and corporation by the provider, but excluding
claims arising out of or related to City programming; and

   1180.20  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in Sections
 1180.01 through
1180.21 are not exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City
may have at law or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek
legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the public
rights-of-way, including damages to the rights-of-way, whether caused by a
violation of any of the provisions of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 or other provisions of this Code.
   (b)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or any portions of this section are illegal or
unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist
hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in
either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days' written
notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit
shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right
or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of
the permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right shall be
considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable permit and the
power to revoke it.

all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise
as now are or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by
the City at any time. A permittee or provider is deemed to acknowledge that its
rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public
and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the Director of Service or

placement and specifications of facilities.

1180.21, subject to any applicable provisions of law, including the Bankruptcy
Act, 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and
conduct the business of the provider and/or permittee, whether in receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of
said 120 days or unless:
         A.   Within 120 days after election or appointment, such receiver or
trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of the relevant
certificate of registration, any outstanding permit, all provisions of this
Code, and remedied all defaults thereunder; and

permittee continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the
termination, lapse, or revocation of a certificate of registration, such
provider or permittee shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions
of Sections
1180.01 through
1180.21 and other laws throughout the period of such continued operation,
provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a
renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate of registration
or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's
regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter.

   (b)   The permitting procedures and authorizations set forth herein shall
apply only to small cell facilities and wireless support structures in the
right-of-way, and do not authorize the construction and operation of a wireline
backhaul facility.
   (c)   Relationship to Other Sections. This section shall supersede all
conflicting requirements of other titles and sections of this Code regarding
the locating and permitting of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the right-of-way.
   (d)   Nothing in this section precludes the City of Maumee from applying its
generally applicable health, safety, and welfare regulations when granting

(Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
   1180.213  APPLICATION REQUIRED.
   (a)   General Requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all
small cell facilities and wireless support structures proposed within the
right-of-way.
      (1)   No person shall occupy or use the right-of-way except in accordance
with law.
      (2)   In occupying or using the right-of-way, no person shall
unreasonably compromise the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (3)   No person shall occupy or use the right-of-way without first
obtaining, under this section, or Section 1332.24 or 4939.031 of the Ohio
Revised Code, any requisite consent of the City of Maumee. Before placing small
cell facilities or wireless support structures in the right-of-way, an operator
must apply for and receive a general right-of-way certificate of registration
under Section
1180.03. If the operator's sole activities in the right-of-way will consist
solely of collocating small cell facilities, constructing, modifying, or
replacing new wireless support structures and associated small cell facilities,
removing such facilities, or eligible facilities requests, then the operator
shall not be required to pay the annual fee for general right-of-way
certificate of registration provided in Section
1180.05. This provision shall not be construed to waive application fees, or
any other construction or work permit necessary for work in the City of Maumee.
   (b)   Pre-Application Conference.
      (1)   Purpose. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the City of
Maumee and request a pre-application conference. This meeting will provide an
opportunity for early coordination regarding proposed small cell facilities and
wireless support structure locations and design, and the application submittal
and review process, in order to avoid any potential delays in the processing of
an application and deployment of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the City of Maumee.
      (2)    Appointment Required. An appointment is required for all pre-
application conferences. Applicants must contact the designated City of Maumee
staff member as noted on the application form, who will provide applicants an
appointment with all applicable City of Maumee representatives in a timely
manner.
   (c)   Application Required. In accordance with federal and state law and the
City of Maumee code, an operator may apply to the City of Maumee to collocate a
small cell facility on an existing wireless support structure and to construct,
maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support structures in, along,
across, upon, and under the City of Maumee rights-of-way. Anyone seeking to
collocate a small cell facility on an existing wireless support structure and/
or to construct, maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support
structures in, along, across, upon, and under the City of Maumee rights-of-way
shall first duly file a written application with the City of Maumee, in
accordance with the requirements in this section and additional requirements
set forth in the Design Guidelines as modified from time to time by the City
Administrator.
   (d)   Required Application Materials. Unless otherwise required by state or
federal law, all applicants shall submit to the City of Maumee materials and
information associated with each application as outlined in the Design
Guidelines in order for the application to be considered complete. (Ord. 051-
2022. Passed 12-5-22.)
   1180.214 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS.
   (a)   Permit Application Review Timeframes.
      (1)   Collocation of Small Cell Facilities on Existing Wireless Support
Structures. The City of Maumee shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
collocate, or to replace or modify a small cell facility on, or associated
with, an existing wireless support structure not later than ninety days after
the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)   New Wireless Support Structures and Associated Small Cell
Facilities. The City of Maumee shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
construct, modify, or replace a wireless support structure associated with a
small cell facility within the right-of-way not later than one hundred twenty
days after the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (3)   Wireless Support Structure and/or Small Cell Facilities Removal.
The City of Maumee shall grant or deny its consent for requests to remove
wireless support structures associated with small cell facilities from the
right-of-way typical to the review timeframes for the General Right-of-Way
Permit required for this activity.
      (4)   Eligible Facilities Request. The City of Maumee shall approve
Eligible Facilities Requests in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 4939,
47 C.F.R. §1.40001, and not later than sixty days after the date of filing by
an entity of a submitted application.
   (b)   Failure to Grant or Deny Within Prescribed Timeframes. If the City of
Maumee fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section or a
request for a relevant work permit within the timeframes required, provided the
time period is not tolled or extended with the written consent of the applicant
and the City Administrator, the request shall be deemed granted upon the
requesting entity providing notice to the City of Maumee that the time period
for acting on the request has lapsed.
   (c)   Application Denials. 
      (1)   The City of Maumee shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent
for small cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-
way.
      (2)   If a request for consent is denied, the City of Maumee shall
provide in writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by
substantial, competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may
reasonably request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not
unreasonably discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)   Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the City of
Maumee, for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any
person based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   
   (d)   Tolling of Required Timeframes.
      (1)   The time periods required in this section may be tolled only:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and the
City of Maumee;
         B.   In cases where the City of Maumee determines that the application
is incomplete; or
         C.   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth this section due to
the lack of resources of the City of Maumee, then the City of Maumee may toll
the time limits as follows:
            1.   The time period may be tolled for up to twenty-one (21) days
for each group of fifteen (15) small cell facility or wireless support
structure requests received by the City of Maumee based on date of receipt by
the City of Maumee.
            2.   In no instance shall the City of Maumee toll the time period
for any small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than
ninety (90) consecutive days. Upon request, the City of Maumee shall provide an
operator written notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless
support structure request.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the City of Maumee
shall provide written notice to the person requesting consent not later than
thirty (30) days after receiving the request, clearly and specifically
delineating all missing documents or information. The missing documents or
information shall be reasonably related to determining whether the request
meets the requirements of applicable federal and state law. Any notice of
incompleteness requiring other information or documentation, including
information of the type described in Section 4939.0313 of the Ohio Revised Code
or documentation intended to illustrate the need for the request or to justify
the business decision for the request, in accordance with state and federal
law, does not toll the time period for incompleteness.
      (3)   The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the City of Maumee's
notice of incompleteness.
        (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the City of Maumee
shall notify the entity not later than ten (10) days after receiving the
supplemental submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the
information identified in the original notice that delineated missing documents
or information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or
subsequent notices under the procedures identified in subsections (1) to (3) of
this section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify
missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice
of incompleteness.
   (e)   Consolidated Application for Multiple Small Cell Facilities And/or
Wireless Support Structures.
      (1)   Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure may
file, at the applicant's discretion, a consolidated application for up to
thirty (30) small cell facility requests or up to thirty (30) wireless support
structure requests in a single application and receive a single permit for the
construction, modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell
facilities or wireless support structures subject to the following:
         A.   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         B.   The City of Maumee may separately address small cell facility
collocations or wireless support structures for which incomplete information
has been received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
section 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code and in separate fee ordinances may
be cumulative. However, the City of Maumee, at its discretion may opt to reduce
such fees in order to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)   In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell facility
or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified, collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under Section 4939.036 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this ordinance. A request by a single operator for a new or
replacement wireless support structure and associated small cell facility
constitutes one request.
   (f)   Timeframe for Completion of Permit.
      (1)   Collocations of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures and the construction of new wireless support structures and/or
associated small cell facilities for which permits have been granted shall be
completed by the operator or its agent within one hundred eighty days after
issuance of the permit, unless:
         A.   The City of Maumee and the operator agree to extend this period;
or
         B.   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a City of Maumee-owned
wireless support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial
power or backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            1.   The operator has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            2.   The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
three hundred sixty days (360) after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If subsections (1)(a) and (b) of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the City of Maumee grants an extension in writing
to the operator.
   (g)   Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support Structure Activities Not
Requiring Consent.
      (1)   City of Maumee consent shall not be required for either of the
following activities conducted in the right-of- way:
         A.   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
         B.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the City of Maumee's current design requirements and
guidelines and that are either:
            1.   Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
            2.   The same size or smaller than the existing wireless
facilities.
      (2)   The City of Maumee may require a Right-of-Way Construction Permit
for any activity described in division (1) of this section and for any activity
for which consent is authorized herein and in accordance with state and federal
law if such work involves blocking any access to the right of way or roadways,
including the use of traffic control measures required by the City of Maumee or
other relevant laws.
         (Ord. 051-2022. Passed 12-5-22.)

Administrator's discretion to promulgate and make publicly available other
information, materials, or requirements in addition to, and separate from,
Design Guidelines so long as the information, materials, or requirements do not
conflict with state or federal law.
   (d)   The City Administrator shall have authority to update or supplement
the Design Guidelines to address relevant changes in law, technology, or
administrative processes.

or permit is required by any provision of any ordinance or the Charter of the
City, involving the construction, reconstruction or alteration of any exterior
architectural feature of any structure within the Old Maumee Architectural
District, unless a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the Board
for such work, except as otherwise provided by Sections
1335.09 to
1335.11. Upon the issuance of any certificate or permit for any work to any
applicant, such issuance shall be conclusive of the fact that either a
certificate of appropriateness has been properly issued or is not required for
the work covered by such certificate or permit and performed under such
certificate or permit.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.05  REFERRAL OF APPLICATION.
   Any application filed with any official of the City for a certificate or
permit, involving but not limited to a building permit, for any work involving
the construction, reconstruction or alteration of any exterior architectural
feature of any structure within the Old Maumee Architectural District for which
a certificate of appropriateness is required by Section
1335.04 shall be promptly referred to the Board, except where the application
is accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness issued not more than one
year prior to the date of the filing of the application or a determination by
the Board that a certificate is not required, which certificate of
appropriateness or determination covers the work for which the certificate or
permit is sought. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require any
application for a certificate or permit, including but not limited to a
building permit, for any work not involving the construction, reconstruction or
alteration of any exterior architectural feature of any structure, or for any
work for which a certificate of appropriateness is not required by Section
1335.11, to be referred to the Board.
   The Board shall determine within forty-five days from the date such
application is filed whether a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued.
The applicant for a certificate or permit shall be entitled to a receipt to be
issued by the person receiving the application on behalf of the City, showing
the time when such application was received, the official of the City on whose
behalf the application was received and the name of the agent acting for the
City.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.06 FILING OF APPLICATION WITH BOARD.
   An application for a certificate of appropriateness may be filed directly
with the Board without the applicant having filed with any other official of
the City an application for any other certificate or permit. Such application
for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the secretary of the
Board. The Board shall determine within forty-five days from the date such
application is filed whether a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued.
The applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall be entitled to a
receipt to be issued by the secretary of the Board showing the time when such
application was received.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.07 STANDARDS OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   No certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for any construction,
reconstruction or alteration involving any exterior architectural feature of
any structure unless the Board, by a majority vote of the members present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present, finds that any exterior architectural
feature involved in the proposed construction, reconstruction or alteration
will be appropriate, that is, any exterior architectural featuare involved,
when constructed, reconstructed or altered, will not be so obviously
incongruous with either the architectural appeal or functional plan of the
structures already existing, or in the course of completion, in the immediate
neighborhood within the Old Maumee Architectural District, as to cause a
substantial depreciation in property values within the immediate neighborhood.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.08 PROCEDURE OF BOARD.
   In making its decision as to whether the proposed construction,
reconstruction or alteration of any exterior architectural feature meets the
standard of appropriateness set forth in Section
1335.07, the Board shall consider in addition to any other pertinent factors,
the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style,
general design, arrangement, texture and material of the exterior architectural
feature involved in relation to the exterior architectural features of other
structures in the immediate neighborhood. The Board shall examine the
application, all data and evidence presented by the applicant of any type
whatsoever, and shall examine any evidence presented by the owners of real
estate in the immediate neighborhood of the proposed construction,
reconstruction or alteration; provided, however, that notice of the application
need not be given to such owners. At least three members of the Board who are
included in the quorum of the meeting of the Board at which an application is
voted upon shall have viewed the site of the proposed construction,
reconstruction or alteration of an architectural feature and this fact shall be
certified in the proceedings of the Board. The Mayor may appoint an advisory
committee to the Board and the Board may call upon such advisory committee or
members thereof for testimony and/or opinions regarding the matter under
consideration. The Board may request from the applicant such additional
relevant information, plans, drawings, sketches, specifications, exterior
elevations and data as it may require to make its determination. The Board may
recommend to the applicant changes in the plans that the Board considers
desirable to make the exterior architectural feature involved appropriate and
may accept his voluntary amendment of the application to include and reflect
such changes. No certificate of appropriateness shall be denied unless the
applicant is granted a hearing, written notice of which shall be served upon
the applicant either personally or by certified mail not less than five days in
advance of the date set for the hearing. No certificate shall be denied solely
by reason of the applicant's choice of color for the proposed exterior
architectural feature or any part thereof. In the event the Board determines
that a certificate should not be issued, the Board shall set forth on its
records the precise and specific reasons for such determination and may include
recommendations respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction or
alteration of any exterior architectural feature to make the same appropriate.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.09 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS ISSUED OR DENIED; DETERMINATION NOT
MADE.
   In the event the Board determines that a certificate of appropriateness
should be issued, within seven days of such determination, the secretary shall
furnish a copy of the certificate of appropriateness to the applicant and if
the application was not filed directly with the Board, to the official of the
City originally receiving the application, and return the application to such
City official for further proceedings.
   In the event the Board determines that a certificate of appropriateness
should not be issued, within seven days of such determination, the secretary
shall give written notice of such determination with the precise and specific
reasons therefor and recommendations of the Board, if any, to the applicant and
if the application was not filed directly with the Board, to the official of
the City originally receiving the application and return the application to
such City official.
   In the event the Board fails to make a determination that a certificate of
appropriateness should be issued or should not be issued within forty-five days
of the date of filing the application for a certificate or permit, excepting in
cases where the application was filed directly with the Board pursuant to
Section
1335.06, the application shall be returned promptly to the official of the City
originally receiving the application for further proceedings, the necessity for
a certificate of appropriateness shall be automatically dispensed with and the
certificate or permit applied for shall not be withheld from issuance for lack
of a certificate of appropriateness after the forty-fifth day following the
date of the filing of the application. With respect to any application for a
certificate of appropriateness filed directly with the Board, pursuant to
Section
1335.06, the application shall be deemed to be denied if the Board fails to
make a determination that a certificate of appropriateness should be issued or
should not be given within forty-five days of the date of the application, and
no reasons need be given, but this shall not preclude the Board from further
considering such application after the forty-fifth day following the date of
the filing of the application.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.10 DETERMINATION BY BOARD.
   At any time within forty-five days after an application for a certificate is
filed, the Board may, by a majority vote of those present at a meeting at which
a quorum is present determine that a certificate of appropriateness is not
required for the reason that the proposed construction, reconstruction or
alteration does not involve any exterior architectural feature or that a
certificate is not required by reason of Section
1335.11. Such determination by the Board shall be reported in writing, within
seven days of the determination to the official of the City originally
receiving the application and to the applicant.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.11 DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the demolition of any structure, but
no certificate or permit for demolition of any structure shall be granted
without fifteen days' advance written notice to the Board by the official of
the City receiving an application for such certificate or permit.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.12 APPEAL TO COUNCIL.
   In addition to all other remedies provided by law, with or without having
exhausted any available administrative appeals, any applicant who is not
satisfied with a determination that a certificate of appropriateness should not
be issued to the applicant made by the Board may appeal such determination
directly to Council by delivering to the Clerk of Council a written petition
seeking reversal of the determination within six months after the determination
has been made. Council, on such appeal, shall undertake a complete hearing on
the merits of the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness and consider all
relevant facts whether or not the same were presented to the Board and
determine whether a certificate of appropriateness shall issued upon all
evidence presented to it by the parties. Council shall determine within ninety
days of the date of filing of the petition whether a certificate of
appropriateness shall be issued or shall not be issued and if the determination
is to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the same shall be issued to the
applicant by the Clerk of Council within seven days of such determination. Such
determination shall be by a majority vote of those councilmen present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present.
(Ord. 95-1971. Passed 10-4-71.)
   1335.13  CONSTRUCTION OF CHAPTER.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or delay, and no
certificate of appropriateness is required for, any ordinary repair or
maintenance work, including but not limited to painting, patching or structural
repair which involves no change in material, design, arrangement or texture of
an exterior architectural feature. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to prevent or delay and no certificate of appropriateness is required for, any
construction, reconstruction or alteration of any feature which any duly
authorized governmental authority including but not limited to the Building
Official, may require for the public safety to correct an unsafe or dangerous
condition.

   1341.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)    Findings of Fact. 
      (1)    The flood hazard areas of the City of Maumee are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)    Uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
         (Ord. 106-2000. Passed 7-17-00.)
   1341.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
         (a)    "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)    "Appeal" means a request for review of the Building and Zoning
Inspector's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
    (c)   "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   (d)   "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Areas
of special flood hazard are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.
   (e)   “Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (f)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
    (g)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations
or storage of equipment or materials.
   (h)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency" (FEMA) means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
    (i)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (j)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map" (FIRM) means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (k)   "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries, and the water
surface elevations of the base flood.
   (l)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   (m)   “Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave actions, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (n)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirement for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to

      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (o)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements
specified in this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (p)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   (q)   "Manufactured home park" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent. This definition
shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Section 3733.01 of the
Ohio Revised Code, for which the Ohio Public Health Council has exclusive rule
making power.
   (r)   "Manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale. This
definition shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Section
3733.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, for which the Ohio Public Health Council has
exclusive rule making power.
   (s)   “New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Maumee's Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (t)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;

      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (u)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
    (v)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (w)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (x)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure"; or
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   (y)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (z)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this chapter.
      (Ord. 104-2011. Passed 8-1-11.)
   1341.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Lands To Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Maumee as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development referenced in Section
1341.03 (b), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City.
   (b)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas
of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood
Insurance Study for the Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas.” This study,
with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated October 6, 2000, and any
revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at 400 Conant Street,
Maumee, Ohio.
   (c)    Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be 1ocated, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless
specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1341.04 (b), Exemption From Filing a Development Permit.
   (d)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements.
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Maumee, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 198-2000. Passed 11-20-00.)
   1341.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
obtained from the Building and Zoning Inspector before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in
Section
 1341.03 (b), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
Building & Zoning Inspector and may include, but not be limited to: site
specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. The following information is required:
      (1)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (2)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1341.07 (b) (2) where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (3)    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1341.07 (b) (2) where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (4)    Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the floor carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished;
      (5)    Certification by a registered professional engineer, architect, or
surveyor of the structure's as-built lowest floor or floodproofed elevation.
 
   (b)    Exemption From Filing A Development Permit. An application for a
Development Permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than $1,000.00. Any
proposed action exempt from filing for a Development Permit is also exempt from
the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 106-2000. Passed 7-17-00.)
   1341.05 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CHAPTER ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Building and Zoning Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and
implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications
in accordance with its provisions.
   (a)    The duties and responsibilities of the Building and Zoning Inspector
shall include but are not limited to:
      (1)    Permit review.
         A.   Review all development permit applications to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permit applications to assure that all
necessary permits have been received from those federal, state or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits
issued by the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act,
         C.   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1341.07(b)(7) is met.
          D.   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)    Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1341.03 (b), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, are
designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas, the
Building and Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, including data obtained under Section
1341.07 (b)(6), Specific Standards, Subdivisions and Large Developments, in
order to administer Section
1341.07(b)(1), Specific Standards, Residential Construction;
1341.07(b)(2), Specific Standards, Nonresidential Construction; and where
floodway data are available, administer Section
1341.07(b)(7), Floodways.
      (3)    Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on the City's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the Building
and Zoning Inspector shall:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1341.04(a)(3).
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, variance
documentation, Conditional Letters of Map Revision, Letters of Map Revision,
Letters of Map Amendment, and as-built elevations.
      (4)    Alteration of watercourses.
         A.   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1341.04 (a) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
         C.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)    Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions.) Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1341.06, Variance Procedure.
      (6)    Alteration of Community Boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA
in writing wherever the boundaries of the City of Maumee have been modified by
annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer
has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a
particular area. In order that the City's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately
represent the City's boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the City of Maumee suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
         (Ord. 106-2000. Passed 7-17-00.)
   1341.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURE APPEAL BOARD.
        (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City of Maumee
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
       (b)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Building and Zoning Inspector in the enforcement or administration
of this chapter.
       (c)    Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to Council.
       (d)    In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (e)   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
1341.06(d) and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
   (f)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records and all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
   (g)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
       (4)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
along the base flood level, providing items (1-11) in Section
1341.06(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (6)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section
1341.06(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. (Ord. 104-2011. Passed 8-1-11.)
   1341.07 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)    General Standards. The following standards apply in all areas of
special flood hazard including those where base flood elevation data have been

that are either (1) located on sites for 180 days or more, or (2) are not fully
licensed and ready for highway use.
      (5)    Enclosures below the lowest floor. The following standards apply
to all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential non-
basement structures which are elevated to the base flood elevation using
pilings, columns, posts, or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood waters. Fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles,
building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         B.   Meet or exceed the following criteria:
             1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (6)    Subdivisions and large developments. In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
 1341.03(b), Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard or
Section
1341.05 (a)(2), Use Of Other Base Flood Elevation Data, the following standards
apply to all subdivision proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions,
and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres
(whichever is less):
         A.   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed
in accordance with standard engineering practices;
         B.   If Section
1341.07 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section

1341.07(b), Specific Standards.
       (7)    Floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1341.03(b) identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1341.05(a)(2). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, projectiles, and cause erosion. The
following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   If subsection (b)(7)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1341.07(b), Specific Standards.
         C.   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Agency. Such request must be submitted by the Building
and Zoning Inspector to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (8)    Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard
where the Flood Insurance Study provides base flood elevation data as set forth
in Section
1341.03 (b), but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.
         B.   If subsection (b)(8)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
end substantial improvement shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1341.07, Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction.
            (Ord. 106-2000. Passed 7-17-00.)
   1341.08 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared by the courts to
be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 106-2000. Passed 7-17-00.)
   1341.99 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be fined or
imprisoned as provided by the laws of the City of Maumee. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City of Maumee from taking such other lawful action

   1345.01 DETERMINING CONDITIONS.
   It is the intent of this section to recognize that the elimination, as
expeditiously as is reasonable, of nuisances that are not in conformity with
the provisions of local, state, and federal codes, is as much a subject of
health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of additional nuisance
conditions that would violate the provisions of this chapter and violate local,
state, and federal regulations. Maumee City Council finds and determines that
in establishing these objectives, the City has determined that, clearly
articulated regulations and standards will effectively promote high quality
property requirements that enhance the appearance, function, and character of
the community and allow the City to enforce, alleviate and/or correct
environmental issues and other issues with properties throughout the City of
Maumee that impair the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Maumee.
All properties not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter are hereby
declared a nuisance and may be subject to abatement as provided herein. It is
further declared and determined that the regulations contained in this chapter
are the minimum regulation necessary to abate the many nuisances that exist
within the City of Maumee and to achieve the purposes of this chapter. For the
purposes of abating public nuisances and assessing for the cost thereof, and
prescribing the conduct, whether of omission or commission, of any natural
person, a legal entity, or a person, agent, business or other legal entity
operating as a proprietorship, limited liability company (LLC), trust,
partnership, unincorporated association, or corporation, as or an owner or
occupier of any lot of land within corporate limits of the City, or of any
building, house or other structure on any such lot of land, a public nuisance
shall exist when:
   (a)   Any Structure that is in a state of any of, but not limited to, the
following: dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction;
overcrowded; open, vacant, or abandoned; damaged by fire to the extent so as
not to provide shelter; in danger of collapse or failure; and, dangerous to
anyone on or near the premises; or
   (b)   Any tree, stack of, or other object remains standing upon such lot of
land in such condition that it shall, if such condition is suffered to
continue, endanger the life, limb, or property, or cause hurt, unsightly,
damage or injury to persons or property on or near the premises; or
   (c)   Any physical condition or occupancy of any premises or its
appurtenances considered an attractive nuisance to children, including, but not
limited to, abandoned wells, shafts, basements, unguarded excavations and
unsafe or unsecured structures, trees, or vegetation; or
   (d)   There is the accumulation on any premises or in any structure of
earth, rubbish, junk, metal, motorized or non-motorized vehicles or equipment

hazard , or is manifestly unsafe or unsecure so as to endanger life, limb, or
property; or
   (f)   Any premises or structure that has unsanitary sewage or plumbing
facilities or has been designated as unsafe for human habitation; or
   (g)   The conduct of any activity thereon or therein which by reason of
noxious odors generated thereby, or of smoke, dust, dirt, or water being cast
or draining therefrom endangers or is harmful to the public health, welfare, or
safety, or materially interferes with the peaceful and lawful use, comfort and
enjoyment of owners or occupants of nearby or adjacent lots of land or
structures; or
   (h)   Any structure or property where any of the following apply: the
structure or property becomes out of repair; out of compliance with Maumee
zoning and/or building codes; out of compliance with other Maumee, State or
Federal codes or regulations; is dilapidated; or that due to lack of adequate
maintenance or neglect, it endangers the public health, welfare, or safety, or
materially interferes with the peaceful enjoyment of owners or occupants of
adjacent property or any combination of the foregoing; or
   (i)   There is any loud, unnecessary, or unusual noise, or any noise or
lighting which either annoys, disturbs, injures, or endangers the comfort,
repose, health, peace or safety of owners or occupants of nearby or adjacent
lots of land or structures; or

   (s)   Any condition exists which has been declared a public nuisance by the
Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 017-2024. Passed 6-10-24.)
   1345.02 COMPLAINTS; INSPECTION OF PREMISES.
      (a)    Whenever a complaint is made or visual inspection discloses to the
City Administrator, Urban Planning Manager, or other City Official, of the
existence of a public nuisance as defined in Section
1345.01, the Urban Planning Manager or other City Official or agent may
promptly inspect or cause to be inspected the premises on which it is alleged
such public nuisance exists or conduct such other investigation as deemed
necessary. Should the Urban Planning Manager, or any other City official or
agent, after such inspection, find that a public nuisance does exist, the Urban
Planning Manager or designee, shall prepare a written notice of the existence
of the nuisance which shall be served on the owner, mortgagee, lienholder,
tenant, or person with a properly recorded interest in the property. Should the
Urban Planning Manager or any other City official or agent, after such
inspection, find that a public nuisance does exist and, if the condition is
within the prohibitions of Section
1345.01 (e), the Fire Chief shall be promptly notified, and such officials
shall be requested to make inspection thereof. Non-emergency inspections of the
interior of buildings or structures shall be scheduled by the City. Notices for
requests for non-emergency interior inspections shall be delivered, mailed, or
emailed to the property owner and/or occupants in advance of inspections.
Inspection staff may also contact the property owner and/or tenant by phone to
schedule said inspection. The code inspection official, their employee, or
subcontractor shall present credentials to the owner and/or occupant and
request entry. If the structure or premises is unoccupied, the code official
shall first make reasonable effort to locate the owner, or owner's authorized
agent, tenant, occupant, or other person having charge or control of the

1-3-23.)
   1361.07  INSPECTIONS.
   In order that they may perform their duties to safeguard the health, safety,
and welfare of the occupants of dwellings and of the general public, the Public
Safety Director, Chief Building Official, Chief of Police and/or Fire Official,
or their reports and/or subcontractors are hereby authorized to make or cause
to be made such inspections of dwellings or dwelling units as are necessary to
enforce the provisions of this code. The inspections that are authorized for
the purpose of enforcement of the provisions of this code shall be made at a
reasonable time and according to the provisions set forth herein. The word
"dwelling" as used in this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to,
those categories of structures defined herein.
   The Director of Public Safety, Chief Building Official, Building Inspectors,
Housing Inspectors, Chief of Police and Fire Officials or their designees,
employees or subcontractors shall inspect buildings and structures regulated by
this code. Inspections may be conducted even though a current certificate of
compliance is on record with the Service and Public Safety Departments,
specifically the Build, Zoning, and Code Division.
   An inspection shall be conducted in the manner best calculated to secure
compliance with this code and appropriate to the needs of the community. In
developing inspection schedules consideration may be given to deferring
inspections for newly constructed residential dwellings or residential
dwellings which have been completely renovated. In the event an inspection
reveals that installation of plumbing, heating, electrical, appliance, or other
item or material for which no permit was obtained, if the owner can
substantiate that the installation took place before that owner acquired the
subject property, the owner shall not be subject to criminal prosecution or
penalty but shall be required to obtain the appropriate permit and have an
inspection of the installation and pay the appropriate building permit and
inspection fees.
   In an emergency situation, the Director of Public Safety, Chief Building
Official, Chief of Police and Fire Official or their designee, employees and/or
subcontractors have the right to enter at any time. For purposes of this code,
an emergency shall exist when the Director of Public Safety, Chief Building
Official, Chief of Police or Fire Official has reasonable grounds to believe
that a condition hazardous to health or safety exists on the premises and
requires immediate attention.
   In a non-emergency situation where the owner or occupant of any dwelling
refuses entry to a unit or dwelling, the Director of Public Safety, Chief
Building Official, Chief of Police, or Fire Official or their designee or
employee shall obtain a warrant from an administrative hearing officer or a
court of competent jurisdiction according to applicable law. In a non-emergency
situation, the property owner and/or occupant shall be afforded the opportunity
for pre-compliance review as to the need for a warrant for an inspection before
a neutral decision maker according to law. (Ord. 002-2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1361.08 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   The certificate of compliance shall be issued only upon an inspection of the
premises by the Chief Building Official or his or her appointed designee or
employee or subcontractor.
   The Chief Building Official or his or her appointed designee or employee or
subcontractor shall not issue a certificate of compliance when any existing
condition constitutes a violation of this code of other building codes as
adopted by Maumee or this ordinance.
   Upon a finding that there is not a condition that would constitute a
violation of the building codes or this code, the certificate of compliance
shall be issued. Upon a finding that there is a condition that would constitute
a violation of the building codes or this code, the certificate of compliance
shall not be issued, and an order to comply with this title shall be issued
immediately as possible and served upon the owner. Upon reinspection and proof
of compliance, the order shall be rescinded, and a certificate of compliance
shall be issued. Subject to the provisions of this section, a certificate of
compliance shall not be valid for a period of more than three (3) years.
However, if the entire premise is found to be violation free without a
necessity of follow-up inspections to check compliance with the original order,
the premise shall be granted an extra year, for a total of four (4) years
before another inspection is required, unless either by complaint or report
another violation is witnessed or comes to the attention of the City.
   A certificate of compliance shall be issued on condition that the building
or structure remains free from violations of this code. If upon reinspection by
the Chief Building Official determines that conditions exist which constitute a
violation of this code, the certificate shall be immediately suspended as to
affected areas, and an order to comply with this code shall be issued
immediately and served upon the owner. On reinspection and proof of compliance,
the order shall be rescinded, and the suspended certificate reinstated, or a
new certificate issued. No person shall alter a certificate of compliance or
represent that a property has a valid certificate of compliance where a valid
certificate of compliance for that property does not exist or has been
suspended or has lapsed. (Ord. 002-2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1361.09  REASONS FOR REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   A certificate of compliance may be denied or revoked by the Director of
Public Safety or Chief Building Official for any of the following reasons:
   (a)   Whenever the City finds that the owner of any non-owner-occupied
residential dwelling or unit has failed to comply with a notice of violation
issued pursuant to this Code;
   (b)   If an owner, tenant, or responsible local agent has refused or failed
to allow an inspection of the non-owner-occupied residential dwelling or unit
by a code enforcement official;
   (c)   An act, omission, or condition exists at a non-owner-occupied
residential dwelling or unit that is unauthorized or beyond the scope of the
property registration granted;
   (d)   The owner has committed an act or omission, or allowed a condition to
exist at the non-owner-occupied residential dwelling or unit that is prohibited
by the provisions of this article or any other City ordinance, regulation, or
provision, or by any state or federal law;
   (e)   The owner has committed an act or omission, or allowed a condition to
exist at the non-owner-occupied residential dwelling or unit that is contrary
to the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Maumee; or

   The owner of a dwelling unit subject to inspection, shall be charged fees by
the Chief Building Official for inspections conducted pursuant to this code in
accordance with the rates and fees as adopted by the City of Maumee in effect
at the time of the inspection. The owner or occupant of property whose dwelling
is inspected pursuant to a housing rehabilitation program or other housing
assistance program of the City shall not be charged for such inspection.
   Inspection fees, applicable late fees as well as any other charges in
connection with property inspection shall be established by the City
Administrator and the Law Director in consultation with the Chief Building
Official. The City Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to calculate
and charge on a fully allocated hourly rate and/or a fixed, graduated rate
which shall generally reduce as the number of units within a structure increase
and shall cover the cost of said program.
   If the owner fails to pay an invoice for inspection fees directed to him or
her within thirty (30) days, the City may cause the costs reflected in said
invoice to be assessed against the premises as a special assessment and may
institute an action against the owner for the collection of said costs in any
court of competent jurisdiction. However, the City's attempt to collect such
costs by any process shall not invalidate or waive the lien upon the premises.
   All fees charged shall be placed in a Housing Code Inspection Fund which can
be used to pay the cost related to maintaining and enforcing Maumee code
provisions related to buildings and zoning. No part of the funds held in the
Housing Code Inspection Fund may be transferred to the general operating fund
for any purpose.

   An owner, occupant, or agent of the owner, whose building has been

inspector to the Administrative Hearings Officer for a hearing related to the
notice of violation(s) and any correction order(s) contained therein. The
Administrative Hearings Officer may grant a specific variance to any
requirement of this article if the literal application of a requirement would
result in practical difficulty for compliance with the particular section(s) at
issue. No relief shall be granted if same would result in either the purpose or
the intent of the particular section(s) at issue being abrogated. The appeal
must be filed within seven (7) days of the receipt of the notice of violation.
The filing of an appeal shall not stay application of the order issued until
such time as the appeal is decided. An appeal hearing shall be held, and a
decision rendered within a timely period of the appeal, which shall not exceed
fourteen (14) days, unless both appellant and the City of Maumee agree in
writing to extend the time for a hearing and decision. The Administrative
Hearings Officer may attach in writing any conditions in connection with the
granting relief that, in his or her judgment, are necessary to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of Maumee. In authorizing
a variance, the Administrative Hearings Officer shall require such evidence as
it may deem necessary to ensure that the purpose and intent of the particular
section(s) at issue will be satisfied. In reviewing a request for relief, the
Administrative Hearings Officer shall consider the following to determine
whether practical difficulty exists:
   (a)   Whether there are exceptional or extraordinary conditions applying to
the property that do not apply to other similar properties;
   (b)   Whether the exceptional or extraordinary conditions resulted from the
action of the property owner;
   (c)   Whether there exists alternative or equivalent methods or materials
that would allow the purpose and intent of the particular section(s) at issue
to be satisfied;
   (d)   Whether strict compliance with the ordinance requirements would be
unreasonably burdensome on the property owner;
   (e)   Whether strict compliance with the ordinance requirements would cause
a financial hardship for the property owner;
   (f)   Whether the granting of a variance would result in a substantial
detriment to the property; and
   (g)   Whether the variance or relief requested is the minimum variance
possible that would still allow the purpose and intent of the particular
section(s) at issue to be met. (Ord. 002-2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1361.20  APPEAL APPLICATION FEE.
   Any person who files an appeal or request for variance, shall be obligated

application fee if he or she finds same would cause a financial hardship for
the applicant.

   1368.01  FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION OF NECESSITY.
   The City Council finds that there are non-residential buildings in the City
which are poorly maintained or neglected by their owners. These buildings
adversely affect citizens who own or occupy nearby buildings and dwellings by
lowering property values and rental values. Many of these poorly maintained and
neglected buildings have become so dilapidated that occupancy is no longer
economically feasible. This increases the incidence of vandalism and fire. The
City Council finds that the elimination and prevention of these conditions is
necessary and is in the best interest of the City and its citizens. (Ord. 002-
2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1368.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of Chapter
1368 is to maintain, preserve and improve the stock of non-residential
buildings in the City. To accomplish this, this article sets out minimum
standards for the exterior maintenance of all non-residential buildings. In
carrying out this purpose, it is the intention of the City Council to exercise
its full powers to protect public health, safety, and welfare, whether the
powers so exercised are derived from the Constitution, state law or the City
Charter. (Ord. 002-2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1368.03  INTERPRETATIONS.
   All words and terms used in this Chapter shall be given their common and
normal meaning unless defined hereinafter. The words and terms defined
hereinafter shall be given the meaning indicated in the interpretation and
enforcement of this Chapter. All other words and provisions of this article
shall be interpreted so as to eliminate or prevent the conditions set out in
findings and determinations of necessity. (Ord. 002-2023. Passed 1-3-23.)
   1368.04 GENERAL USAGE.

   1380.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  
   The City of Maumee, Lucas County Ohio finds, determines, and declares that:
   (a)   Vacant and Foreclosed properties and buildings, and properties in the
foreclosure process, that remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable
period of time become an attractive nuisance to vandals, children, a harborage
for rodents, an increased fire hazard, and an invitation to vagrants and
criminals as a temporary residence and as a place to engage in illegal conduct,
frequently including illegal drug-related activity; that unkempt and unsecured
grounds surrounding such buildings invite the dumping of garbage and trash
thereon and the congregation of unauthorized persons who use the property for
illegal activity; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within
the City, necessitate additional governmental services and costs, significantly
interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, and depress
market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax revenues; and
that such buildings accordingly create an unhealthy and unsafe condition
affecting the public and constitute an unreasonable use of property and a
public nuisance.
   (b)   Protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the
establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions
may be prevented and abated.
   (c)   Vacant properties that are going through or have been through the
foreclosure process are frequently the responsibility of banks, lenders, and/or
servicers.
   (d)   Vacant Properties are the responsibility of the property owner.
   (e)   Even one vacant property that is not actively and well maintained can
cause blight and crime.
   (f)   It is in the interest of the welfare of neighborhoods in the city that
property owners, banks, lenders, and/or servicers which fail to maintain vacant
properties that they own or have an interest in be subject to the imposition of
fines.
