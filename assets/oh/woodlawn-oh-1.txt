considered present if he or she attends in person or, in the event a meeting is
held by electronic, teleconference, web, or video means as provided in this

thereof, shall be revised or amended, unless the new bylaw or ordinance
contains the entire bylaw, ordinance, or section revised or amended, and the
bylaw, ordinance, or section so amended shall be repealed. For the purposes of
this section, it is sufficient to attach a copy of the amended item to the
bylaw, ordinance, or resolution. Each such bylaw, resolution, and ordinance
shall be adopted or passed by a separate vote of the Council of the Village,
and the yeas and nays shall be entered into the minutes.

state law.
When ordinances are revised, codified, rearranged, published in book form, and
certified as correct by the Clerk of the Council and the Mayor, such
publication shall be a sufficient publication, and the ordinances so published,
under appropriate titles, chapters and sections, shall be held the same in law
as though they had been published as required by Council's adopted method of
timely publication. If such revision or codification is made by the Village and
contains new matter, it shall be a sufficient publication of such codification,
including the new matter, to publish, in the manner required by such Sections,
a notice of the enactment of such codifying ordinance, containing the title of
the ordinance and a summary of the new matters covered by it. Such revision or
codification may be made under appropriate titles, chapters, and sections, and
in one ordinance containing one or more subjects.

prevention, plumbing code, electrical code, building code, property
maintenance, refrigeration machinery code, piping code, boiler code, heating
code, or air conditioning code by incorporation by reference, the publication

If the agency which originally promulgated or published the code thereafter
amends that code, the Village may adopt such amendment or change by
incorporation, by reference and in amending ordinance by the same procedure as
required for the adoption of the original code without the necessity of setting
forth in full in the amending ordinance the provisions of the original
ordinance or code.

shall be deemed to be in full and complete compliance with

CHAPTER 204: OFFICIAL STANDARDS
Editor’s note:
   The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from 2:00 a.m.
of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in October.
Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform
observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in 1967,
except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from Daylight
Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with a
different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

      (7)   No bid or rejected bids. If, after advertisement as provided in
this chapter, no bids are received or if all bids are rejected, the Municipal
Manager may either seek new, competitive bids, or solicit proposals and/or
quotes, negotiate the terms, conditions and other relevant factors to obtain a
contract advantageous and beneficial to the Village.

(Ord. 33-2022, passed 9-27-2022)
§ 206.04 EXECUTION AND MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS.
   (a)   No contract shall be enforceable against the Village unless it has

Village by the Municipal Manager or designee, and bears the signature of the
Finance Director, certifying the availability and appropriation of funds.
   (b)   Approval procedure for alterations or modifications. An alternation or
modification to a competitively bid contract shall be approved only upon the

§ 206.05 BIDDING PROCEDURES.
   Pursuant to Section
4.03 of the Village of Woodlawn Charter, the following procedures shall apply
to contracts that require competitive bidding:
   (a)   Time between notice and bid opening. There shall be no minimum time
requirement between the publishing of the notice and the opening of bids. The
Village shall notify prospective bidders of the bid opening date and time in
the notice and shall adjust the same to meet the needs of the Village by
issuing addenda when necessary.
   (b)   Addenda do not extend bid opening. The Village may issue such addenda
to the bid documents as it feels necessary and such addenda may be issued up to
and including the last business day before the bid opening without any
extension of the bid opening date. Addenda issued the same day as the bid
opening shall cause the bid opening date to be extended to the date and time
set forth in such addenda.
   (c)   Estimate of cost. The Village shall disclose the estimated cost of the
project when it determines that doing so is in the best interest of the
Village.
   (d)   Time for award of bids. In the notice required for the bid
solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit for awarding a
contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this time period. The
Village's failure to award and execute the contract within this period
invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time
for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the
Village and the bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with respect to whom
the Village subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such extension shall
not entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (e)   Withdrawal of bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to R.C. § 9.31;
such withdrawal shall not modify the Village's right to award to the next
lowest and best bidder.
   (f)   Bids in excess of estimate. The Village may award contracts regardless
of the value of the bid as compared to the value of the estimated cost.
   (g)   Bonus and liquidated damages for time. The Village may offer a bonus
for completion of a contract prior to a specified date, or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.
   (h)   Return of bid guarantees. The Village shall return bid guarantees to
bidders to which it does not award a contract in a reasonably timely manner.
(Ord. 33-2022, passed 9-27-2022)
§ 206.06 CONTENTS OF BIDS GENERALLY.
   Bids submitted to the Village shall specifically detail all labor, equipment
and materials of every description and all work to be supplied that is
necessary to fully complete the construction required in strict conformity with
plans, specifications and instructions prepared by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 33-2022, passed 9-27-2022)
§ 206.07 INVALID TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
   No contract entered into by the Village for the procurement of goods or
services shall include any of the following:
   (a)   A provision that requires the Village to indemnify or hold harmless
another person.
   (b)   A provision by which the Village agrees to binding arbitration or any
other binding extra-judicial dispute resolution process.
   (c)   A provision that names a venue for any action or dispute against the
state other than a court of proper jurisdiction in Hamilton County, Ohio.
   (d)   A provision that requires the state to agree to limit the liability
for any direct loss to the state for bodily injury, death, or damage to
property of the Village caused by the negligence, intentional or willful
misconduct, fraudulent act, recklessness, or other tortious conduct of a person
or a person's employees or agents, or a provision that would otherwise impose
an indemnification obligation on the Village.
   (e)   A provision that requires the Village to be bound by a term or
condition that is unknown to the Village at the time of signing a contract,
that is not specifically negotiated with the Village, or that may be
unilaterally changed by the other party.
   (f)   A provision that is inconsistent with the Village's obligations under
R.C. §§ 121.22 and/or 149.43.
   (g)   A provision for automatic renewal such that Village fund are or would
be obligated in subsequent fiscal years.
   If a contract contains a term or condition described in this section, the
term or condition is void ab initio, and the contract containing that term or
condition otherwise shall be enforceable as if it did not contain such term or
condition. A contract that contains a term or condition described in this
section shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Ohio law
notwithstanding any term or condition to the contrary in the contract.
(Ord. 33-2022, passed 9-27-2022)
§ 206.08 DISCRIMINATION; EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.
   It is the policy of the Village of Woodlawn, Ohio, to prohibit all forms of
illegal discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, and disability or handicap in the competitive bidding and the award of
public contracts. By application of this policy of nondiscrimination, the
Village of Woodlawn, Ohio, seeks to ensure equal treatment and equal
opportunities for economic inclusion of all persons. The Village will not allow
itself to become a passive participant in illegal discrimination and will take
affirmative steps to ensure that all persons contracting with the Village of
Woodlawn, Ohio, comply with its policy of nondiscrimination.

§ 414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

§ 414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u- turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u- turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one- way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-
turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
§ 414.04 SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
§ 414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

§ 432.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right- hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a
left turn into or from an alley, private road, or driveway.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. § 2317.02,
may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant
and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substance test at the
request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this division, if in
that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under division (d)(1)B. shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN- INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of
this section, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense. If the person was
under arrest other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read
to the person to be tested, as required under § 434.012, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person's expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I., or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

§ 434.012 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   (1)   As used in this section:
         PHYSICAL CONTROL has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood, blood

434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test ortests under division (a)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (a)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the

      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (c) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person's own expense. Divisions (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (a)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
   (b)   Except as provided in division (a)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §

434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The
officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains the information
described in division (c) of this section and shall read the advice to the
person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the
person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or
more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of the form, and the
witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must
submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the
arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and,
if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time
limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to
the test or tests.
   (c)   Except as provided in division (a)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (b) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
“You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested - operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI, OVUAC,
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
“(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”

to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within
24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately

appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall
retain it pending the arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken
under Ohio R.C. §
   (e)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (a)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (b) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of § 434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test
results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance,
or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the
arresting officer shall do all of the following:
         A.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         B.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person

person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         C.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         D.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (e)(1)D.5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (c) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (e)(1)D.5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (a)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (e)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of § 434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (f)   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by regular
first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but not later
than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an unsworn
report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the report is
complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn to by the
arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the
arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the sworn
report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge for
which the person was arrested.
   (g)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C. § 4511.197 relative
to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered
by the report.
   (h)   (1)   A suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in Ohio R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
immediately from the time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of
suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is
not guilty of the charge that resulted in the person's being requested to take
the chemical test or tests under division (a) of this section does not affect
the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
434.01(a) or (b), Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
434.011 or Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, regardless of whether the person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended
under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's
initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within
five days of the persons' arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her,
subject to any continuance granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. §
4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that section.

fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(9) and (b)(10) of this section. The end of every school zone

or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-Control
Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, SCHOOL means any school chartered under
Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding year

for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most

lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on
August 9,1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional school zone
boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when those
boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this
section.
         E.   As used in this division, CROSSWALK has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.

district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in
addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the
offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other
sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section, or any
combination of three or more violations of this section or R.C. § 4510.11,
4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the
court, in addition to any other sentence that it imposes on the offender, may
order the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle involved in the offense to the
state.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §§ 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable.
The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this section.

4301.99, 4510.032, 4510.22, or 4510.33, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(3)B. of this
section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be
sentenced pursuant to §

698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for

who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any public roads
and highways is guilty of driving under a 12-point suspension, a misdemeanor of
the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to a minimum term of
three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days of jail time
imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)
§ 436.072 OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road

vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section or one
equivalent offense, driving under O.V.I. suspension is a misdemeanor of the

         D.   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender’s name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender’s vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle
that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is
assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2).
   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver’s license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver’s license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person

§ 436.075 FAILURE TO REINSTATE LICENSE.
   (a)   No person whose driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit or nonresident’s operating privilege has been
suspended shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public road or highway or any
public or private property after the suspension has expired unless the person
has complied with all license reinstatement requirements imposed by the court,
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles or another provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person had not been reinstated by
the person at the time of the alleged violation of division (a) of this
section. The person charged with a violation of division (a) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to reinstate a
license, and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as provided in division (c)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
698.02(d) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of a violation of division (a) of this
section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or been convicted of two
or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.21 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.

suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary driver's license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
(R.C. § 4510.21)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non- economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section 408.02.

§ 440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.99)
   (c)   Chester Road; Wayne Avenue. No person shall operate a tractor-trailer,
semitrailer, tractor, truck, excavating machine or any self-propelled or
animal-drawn vehicle or equipment bearing a gross weight of more than 20,000
pounds, including load, upon Chester Road or Wayne Avenue within the corporate
limits of the Village. The gross weight, including the load, of any vehicle,
shall include the gross weight of any trailer attached to any vehicle, together
with its load. Notwithstanding the provisions of this division, the vehicles
described in this division may use Chester Road and Wayne Avenue for the
purpose of delivering goods or merchandise to, or receiving the same from,
premises located along such streets and not otherwise accessible. Such vehicles
so using such streets shall enter and leave the same at the intersection of

of five tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than State routes and
County roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked
as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is
necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of
storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act
other than passage through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating
from either a state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality
shall confine such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the
purpose of the departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated
local authority shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the
construction and material specifications for such roads and the load resistance
of such roads as determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be
posted with signs indicating such weight limits.
   (e)   Local permit and conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by §§
408.01 and
408.02.
§ 440.02 MAXIMUM WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be operated upon the public highways, streets,

   (e)   Special parking locations and privileges for persons with disabilities
that limit or impair the ability to walk, also known as disabled parking spaces
or disability parking spaces, shall be provided and designated by all political
subdivisions and by the State and all agencies and instrumentalities thereof at
all offices and facilities where parking is provided, whether owned, rented, or
leased, and at all publicly owned parking garages. The locations shall be

not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the
motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all
towing and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and
storing motor vehicles.

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the special

(Ord. 06-2006, passed 3-28-2006)
§ 452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief's territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of junk motor vehicle prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
§ 452.055 PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,

   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow- away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and

storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B.   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(H)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be
recovered.
         B.   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief's jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner's and lienholder's last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this
section.
         D.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (h)(6)C. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §

division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:

by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the

§ 606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 606.03 CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.

any element of which takes place in this Municipality;
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the

division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality;
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this Municipality;
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A
PUBLIC SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or

   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

§ 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it

(R.C. § 2901.13)
§ 606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are “involuntary acts.”
      (4)   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
§ 606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.

commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.

reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

county in which the victim of hazing resides or in which the hazing is
occurring or has occurred.

local or national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested,
commanded or tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee
or officer of the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing. If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary

under division (b)(2)A. of this section fails to match the information printed

shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan may require a seller or an agent or employee of

transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
         A.   Whether a person to whom the seller or agent or employee of a
seller sells, gives away, or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco

unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,
the remaining provisions of this chapter shall not be invalidated.

(ORC 2935.36(E))
§ 698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the offender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or
2947.19 and 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in §§
666.99 and
698.03 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a Department of
Probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the Department of Probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the Department of Probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e) or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition t to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if
the offender is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. §
2930.01, shall sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this
division (f) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as
required by this division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the
financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include,
but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
(f)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender's payment history available to the victim, victim's
representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
§ 698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections 666.99 or 698.02 of this
Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence upon an
offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or
combination of sanctions under Section 698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not
impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government
resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;

consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).

shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.

statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the

shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

§ 698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C) or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

§ 698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
Editor’s note:
   Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2005 updating and revision of
these Codified Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C.
2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.
§ 698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of
Ordinances that is substantially equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code,
and a court is permitted or required to suspend a person’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit for a violation of that provision, a
court, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privileges for the period of time the court determines appropriate,
but the period of suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this
Code of Ordinances shall not exceed the period of suspension that is permitted
or required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Revised
Code to which the provision of this Code of Ordinances is substantially
equivalent.

§ 812.02 INITIAL REVIEW AND ESTABLISHMENT OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notification of operators of village’s intent to regulate. Upon the
adoption of this section and the certification of the Village by the FCC, the
Village or the ICRC shall immediately notify all cable operators in the
Village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the Village intends
to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated
equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992, being 47 U.S.C. §§ 554 et

   (b)   Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the
Village or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the Village or the ICRC,
its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited determination of rates.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that a cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the Village.
      (2)   If Council or the ICRC takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the Village, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended review of rates. 
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates at issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
60 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the
Village, and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150-day
period, it shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (e)   Public hearings. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (f)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector’s name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
the Village Council or the ICRC’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall
be established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates, and the cable operator’s
rates will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. Council will review a
cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service
review. Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if
the cable operator makes the necessary showing. However, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable
operator’s September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent, will prescribe the
cable operator’s new rates.
   (i)   Decisions of Council.
      (1)   Contents of formal resolutions. After completion by the Village or
the ICRC of the cable operator’s proposed rates, Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of- service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) hereof, as applicable.
In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds
of the excessive portion of the rates, with interest (computed at applicable
rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional
tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any
refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as
directed in Council’s decision resolution.
      (3)   Statements of reasons for decisions and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved, in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and Council must give public notice of
its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official
newspaper of the Village.
   (j)   Appeals. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 9-1994, passed 2-8-94)
§ 812.03 REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF REQUESTS FOR INCREASES IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notification to Village and subscribers of proposed increases. A cable
operator in the Village who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the Village and the ICRC
and notify all subscribers at least thirty days before the cable operator
desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often
than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the
initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited determination of rates.
      (1)   If Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the Village.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the Village, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (c)   Extended review of rates.
      (1)   If Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of- service showing, Council
shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional
periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council or the ICRC needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase shall be tolled during the extended
review period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the 90 or 150-day period,
it shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the
cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of
the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public hearings. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (e)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit  the objection in writing anytime
before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made
part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector’s
name and address.
   (f)   Delayed determinations. If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issues a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, Council shall
review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard
form authorized by the FCC. Based on Council’s findings, the basic cable rate
shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing. However, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then-current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   (i)   Decisions of Council. Council’s decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved, in whole or in part, or if objections were
made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, then the resolution must
state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public
hearing by a person requesting the secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments, with
interest, if:
         A.   Council was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period described in subsection (c) hereof; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeals. Council’s decision concerning rate increases for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable Federal regulations.
(Ord. 9-1994, passed 2-8-94)
§ 812.04 CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (a)   Required.
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, Council or
the ICRC may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to
that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request that the
information be kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, Council or the ICRC may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accordance with the
standard.
   (b)   Requests for confidentiality. 
      (1)   A cable operator submitting information to Council may request, in
writing, that the information not be made routinely available for public
inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the
information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      (2)   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      (3)   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      (4)   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall not be considered.
   (c)   Council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of
subsection (b) hereof will be acted upon by Council. Council will grant the
request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a
case for nondisclosure consistent  with applicable Federal regulations. If the
request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the
information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a
case for nondisclosure and Council denies the request, Council shall take one
of the following actions:
      (1)   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the Village, the cable operator may request that the Village
return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the Village will
comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance when the public interest
so requires will the information be made available for public inspection.
      (2)   If the information was required to be submitted by Council, the
information will be made available for public inspection.
   (d)   Appeals. If Council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable
operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days
of Council’s decision, and the release of the information will be stayed
pending review.
(Ord. 9-1994, passed 2-8-94)
§ 812.05 AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
   (a)   Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per-channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI Index.
   (b)   Other external costs.
      (1)   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the
GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
State and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      (2)   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per-channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation, or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per- channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   (c)   Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the Village
at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment
items. The Village shall review the increase to determine whether the item or
items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the Village makes no objection
within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into
effect.
(Ord. 9-1994, passed 2-8-1994)
§ 812.06 REFUNDS.
   The Village may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion
of previously paid rates under the following circumstances:
   (a)   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in
excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or
   (b)   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued
by the Village.
(Ord. 9-1994, passed 2-8-94)
§ 812.99 PENALTY.
   If a cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order,
the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00)

for bodily injuries, including death at any time resulting therefrom, and for
damages to or destruction of property sustained during the terms of such policy
by any person other than the insured and employees of the insured, and

maintained or used with the consent or acquiescence of the owner, by one other

or property as indicated above, due to the negligent operation, maintenance or
use of such vehicle, that the insurer or the obligors in the bond, as the case
may be, shall pay to any judgment creditor of such person so maintaining, using
or operating such vehicle, any final judgment rendered against such person so
maintaining, using or operating such vehicle, provided that such judgment
creditor has filed his or her suit or filed notice of claim for such loss in
all respects as is provided for the judgment creditor of the insured in the
foregoing paragraph.

business in the State, approved as to sufficiency by the Mayor and as to form
by the Law Director, holding and binding the principal and sureties to the same
liability and subject to the same conditions as in the case of policies of
insurance provided for herein. It shall further be permissible for the
applicant to furnish insurance as to damages for personal injuries, including
death, and an indemnity bond or bonds as to the property damages, or vice
versa.
§ 868.07 TERMINATION OF INSURANCE OR BOND.
   Every such policy or certificate of insurance or bond shall contain a clause

notice before the cancellation, expiration, lapse or other termination of such
insurance or the expiration, withdrawal of the surety therefrom or other
termination of such bond, and the license granted shall be suspended upon the
termination of the insurance or bond or upon the termination of the liability
of the insurer or surety thereon, in accordance with such notice, unless and
until a new policy or certificate of liability insurance or a new indemnity

give the notice required shall operate to continue the liability of the insurer
or surety for the benefit of persons injured or damaged, and such policy shall
continue in full force and effect.

chapter within 30 days after the date of the sale of such business or
retirement therefrom, and his or her successor in business shall be required to

taxes so collected and unpaid, together with interest, if any, until such time
as the former owner produces a receipt from the Director of Finance showing
that the taxes have been paid or a certificate that no taxes are due. If the
purchaser of a business fails to withhold purchase money as provided in this
section, and the taxes so collected are due and unpaid after the 30-day period

ASSESSMENTS; SURCHARGE ON UNPAID TAX.

this chapter neglects or refuses to file any return required by this chapter
or, having tendered a return, neglects or refuses to pay the amount of tax
imposed by this chapter as shown by such return, the Director of Finance shall
make an estimated assessment of the probable amount of the tax payable by such
person, to which shall be added a penalty of ten percent of the amount
assessed. The Director of Finance shall promptly thereafter give or send by
mail a notice of such estimated assessment and penalty to the person against
whom such assessment and penalty has been made.
   (b)   The Director of Finance may make an estimated additional assessment,
to which shall be added a penalty of ten percent of the assessment, against any
person who files any return as required by this chapter but who refuses to
permit the Director of Finance or a duly authorized deputy to examine his or
her books of account and papers pertaining to the business for which the return
was made. The Director of Finance shall promptly thereafter give or send by

person, together with written notice of the time when and the place where such
person may be heard on a petition for reassessment, as provided in this
chapter.

   A person against whom an additional assessment, estimated assessment or
estimated additional assessment has been made by the Director of Finance may
file an application for reassessment with the Director of Finance. Such
application shall be filed within 30 days after receipt of notice of such
additional assessment, estimated assessment or estimated additional assessment
and penalty from the Director of Finance, and shall contain all the arguments
and reasons why such assessment and/or penalty should be reversed, vacated or
modified. Within 20 days of the filing of such application for reassessment,
the Director of Finance shall redetermine his or her former assessment,
estimated assessment or estimated additional assessment, and shall affirm,
reverse, vacate or modify such assessment.
   Such determination shall be final, and the assessment, estimated assessment
or estimated additional assessment shall become payable ten days after notice
thereof is given or sent by mail to the person filing the application, unless
such person, within such ten days, gives notice of intention to appeal to the
Common Pleas Court of the County. The appeal to such Court shall be filed
within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the Director of Finance.
§ 880.13 SERVICE OF NOTICES.
   A notice authorized or required under this chapter may be given by mailing
the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope
addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by him
or her pursuant to this chapter, or if no such return has been filed, then to
such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be prima-
facie evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom it was
addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to this chapter by
the giving of notice shall commence from the date of mailing such notice.

thereof, or his or her executors, administrators, successors or assigns, makes
application for a refund thereof, for the benefit of the person from whom the
tax was collected, and the Director of Finance determines that such tax or
penalty, or any portion thereof, was erroneously or illegally collected, and
that the same can and will be duly refunded to the person from whom the same
was collected, the Director of Finance shall pay such amount to the person
entitled to such refund, out of the Admission Tax Rotary Fund. For like cause
and within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the
Director of Finance, but no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid
pursuant to a determination of the Director of Finance, as provided for in §
880.12, unless the Director of Finance, after a hearing pursuant to §
880.12, or on his or her own motion, reduced the tax or penalty or it has been
established by an appeal to the Common Pleas Court of the County, pursuant to §
880.12, that such determination was erroneous or illegal, in which event a
refund shall be made as set forth in this section, upon the termination of such
appeal. An application for a refund made as provided in this section shall be
deemed a petition for reassessment within the meaning of §
880.12, and the Director of Finance may receive additional evidence with
respect thereto. After making his or her determination, the Director of Finance
shall give notice thereof to the applicant and the applicant shall have the
right to appeal as provided in §
880.12.

§ 882.013 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (a)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub H.B. 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
   (b)   As mandated by the above amendments, the Village passed Ordinance No.
20-2015, effective January 1, 2016, which comprehensively amended Chapter 882
in accordance with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the Village to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Village.
   (c)   Ordinance 20-2015, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding

beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (d)   House Bill 49, passed by the 132nd General Assembly, includes Section
803.100, purporting to require that municipalities, on or before January 31,
2018, adopt certain municipal income tax provisions to authorize state
officials to collect and administer municipal net profit taxes. Section 803.100
of House Bill 49 references and relies upon R.C. § 718.04(A), which purports to
make municipal income taxing authority conditional upon a municipality's
adoption of code sections as dictated by the State.
   (e)   As mandated by the above amendments, the Village passed Ordinance 05-
2018 which amends Chapter 882 to adopt the required code sections to authorize

beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.

for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter 882 effective
January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016,

   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the Village
during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if any, from
each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying wages paid
to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of every other
municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been withheld
from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other information
required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service
form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee, and other
information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal

employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
principal place of work with respect to those qualifying wages for the purposes
of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (b)(2) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

         C.   The employee is a resident of the Village and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in §
882.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,

services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Village.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
882.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the

defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the State to withhold and remit municipal income

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such

         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable

that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in

         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by of §
882.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which
the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
      A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
882.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's

that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add
to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law;
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is

municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.

taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
882.03(a) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
882.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
882.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
882.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under §
882.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village or Tax
Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in division (c)(1)A.
through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
882.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
882.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under §
882.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the
higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, commissions, or other personal service
compensation for work done outside the Village, if it is made to appear that
the taxpayer has paid a municipal income tax on the same income taxable under
this chapter to another municipality, will be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by the taxpayer or on the
taxpayer's behalf to such other municipality. The credit may not exceed the tax

§ 882.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
QUALIFYING LOSS means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   QUALIFYING TAX RATE means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by
the Village as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds
as provided in §
882.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the Village, but
was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to
collection and recovery by the Village. To the extent a refund of such tax or
withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in §
882.096, the Village will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other Village against the income tax the Village claims
is due. If the Village's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net
difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the Village, along
with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
882.096.

paid to another municipal corporation if the village has reduced credit for tax
paid to another municipal corporation. Section

REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by the Village. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
882.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in §
882.092, the provision in §
882.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due
is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this section.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
THE DATE OF POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in §
882.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Village shall accept for filing a generic
form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the Village in
accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions,
or rules adopted by the Village or Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the Village's ordinance or resolution
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, WORKSITE LOCATION has the same meaning
as in §
882.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location within the Village, and the person has filed all
appropriate and required returns and remitted all applicable income tax and
withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The Tax Administrator is not
required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not complied with the
provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the Village, and does
not expect to be subject to the Village's income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Village in the taxable
year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Village in accordance with this

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
882.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
882.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

withholding tax levied by the Village:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
882.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
882.10(a)(4).

or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted
such a form, the Tax Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax
Administrator considers appropriate, that a person is the authorized
representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of
such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
882.99 for a violation of §

   (a)   An OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR means an opinion issued under this
section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not
include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Village in accordance
with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Village's income
tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of
the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Village's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Village in order to obtain a
more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
882.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.

received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be

§ 882.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

Village, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Village. This member may be an employee of the
Village, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the
Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Village shall be two years. There is no limit
on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed
by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Village shall serve at the discretion of the
administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
882.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
882.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,

CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to §§
882.23 to
882.38 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in §
882.03(qq) is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95, §§

882.38, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the Village, on a form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   A.   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the Village of its
termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to §§
882.23 to
882.38, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer §§
882.23 to
882.38. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Tax Commissioner by
law, the Tax Commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as

882.03(pp).
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.24 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in §§
882.23 to
882.38 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall have
control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined
in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to Federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and §
882.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in §§
882.23 to
882.38. As used in §§
882.23 to
882.38 only:
   (a)   MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME. Income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under §
882.26, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME, for a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as
described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and §
882.03, means a C corporation's Federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of Federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing Federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted Federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's Federal taxable income in accordance with §
882.29(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's Federal taxable income in accordance with §
882.29(e)(3)B.
      If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that
has made the election described in §
882.03(ss), and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in §
882.03(u)(5)A., the taxpayer shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
      Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of Federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   TAXPAYER. Has the same meaning as in §
882.03, except that TAXPAYER does not include natural persons or entities

receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required
to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   TAX RETURN or RETURN. The notifications and reports required to be
filed pursuant to §§
882.23 to
882.38 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   TAXABLE YEAR. The calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year ending
during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for Federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§
882.23 to
882.38 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for Federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for Federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   ASSESSMENT. A notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax issued
pursuant to §
882.33.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.25 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under §
882.23.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under §
882.05;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
882.33(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
882.33(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided
that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from a
stock of goods located within the Village.
         B.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under §
882.03(gg) by the Village or substantially similar provision of the codified
ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount
that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net
profit that was apportioned to the Village any amount other than the amount
upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to
the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it receives in the
performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in §
882.23. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, the Village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax

   (e)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

either through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.

of this section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the
five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under §
882.063(b)(1) is terminated, a valid election made under this section is
binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated Federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in §
882.025, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under §
882.24(b) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
882.25, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
882.25, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated Federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in §
882.25, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
882.23 to
882.38 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under §
882.25 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
882.23 to
882.38 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.

§ 882.30 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
882.23 fails to pay any tax as required under §§
882.23 to
882.38, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the
date an assessment is issued under §
882.33, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.31 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   COMBINED TAX LIABILITY means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this State for a
taxable year.
      (2)   ESTIMATED TAXES means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year,
forty-five percent of the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §§
882.23 to 882.39 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income
tax return for that year.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.32 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by §§
882.23 to
882.38 or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §§
882.23 to
882.38 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the Commissioner may
impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month or
fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the
due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under §§
882.23 to
882.38 fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the
following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, five percent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
882.23 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §§
882.23 to
882.38 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or
contains information that on its face indicates that the return is
substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to
a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to
delay or impede the administration of §§
882.23 to
882.38, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §§
882.23 to
882.38, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§
882.34, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under §
882.33 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §§
882.23 to
882.38 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.33 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
882.23 to
882.38 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
      The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in §
882.34 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by §§
882.23 to
882.38, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. §
5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to
petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this State, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special
judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
      If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by §
882.34, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.34 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
882.23 to
882.38, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (a) of this
section. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director
of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax
refund fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than ten
dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.35 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
882.23 and used to determine the tax due under §§
882.23 to
882.38 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for Federal income tax purposes or after any Federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated Federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §
882.33 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in §
882.34, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
§
882.34. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
(Ord. 05-2018, passed 2-27-2018)
§ 882.36 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§
882.23 to
882.38 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to
investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal and State
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to §§
882.23 to
882.38 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Commissioner,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any person, by
notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Commissioner
determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the
extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
Federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

to §
882.064 or
882.065, shall be available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed

882.23, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A municipal
corporation shall submit the following information to the Tax Commissioner on

taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Village granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under §
882.064 or
882.065, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.

§ 1026.17 REVIEWING DEVELOPMENTS SUBJECT TO DISCRETIONARY REVIEW BY THE
VILLAGE.
   (a)   (1)   Except on residential properties of 6,000 square feet or less,
where the Village has discretionary development review of a proposed
development, either because of planned unit development, conditional use or
variance zoning review, the use of development contracts, or otherwise, the
Village shall require a property owner to provide a tree plan prior to approval
by the Village. That plan shall contain a complete survey plat of all trees
located on the development site with calipers in excess of two inches,
identifying each by species, size and location. Stands of trees may be
identified by designating a stand of trees on the survey plat and approximating
the number of each species and size of trees within the stand. The survey shall
also identify the trees to be removed and the trees to be retained as a part of
the development. Where trees are to be removed as a result of the development,
the developer shall provide a plan identifying what replacement of trees is to
take place on the site including the location, species and size of the
replacement trees. At a minimum, for every one tree removed, two shall be
planted of comparable size and value of the one removed, or in the case of
extraordinary circumstances, as otherwise agreed to by the Tree Board.
      (2)   The tree plan and supporting data shall be reviewed by the
Municipal Manager who may consult with the Board and who shall consider any
guidelines that have been established by the Board. The Municipal Manager may
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the tree plan and so advise the
Building Inspector, Zoning Inspector, Planning Commission, Board of Zoning
Appeals or Village Council, whichever is appropriate, depending upon the nature
of the zoning or development review underway. Tree approval by the Municipal
Manager does not authorize any building or development activity or constitute
zoning approval and the developer must still comply with any requirements for
and obtain a building permit or zoning approval.
   (b)   No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued pursuant to the Woodlawn
Code of Ordinances, unless inspection of the site by the Village Code
Enforcement Officer or other officer who may be from time to time empowered to
issue certificates of occupancy has determined compliance with the requirements
of the tree approval.
   (c)   Under appropriate circumstances, the Village may require the posting
of surety to ensure compliance with the conditions of a tree approval. If the
required tree approval conditions have not been met within the life of the
surety and provided the Municipal Manager or his or her designee have not
granted a written extension, the Village shall use the surety to ensure that
those conditions are met.
   (d)   All tree plan approvals shall be conditioned upon the maintenance of
the trees and require replacement where such trees fail to survive.
Replacements shall be required within 30 days of notice by the Municipal
Manager, except that during the winter season, at the request of the property
owner, the Municipal Manager may grant a longer period of time for the
replacement of trees.

§ 1026.18 APPEALS OF DECISIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL MANAGER.
   Decisions of the Municipal Manager relating to tree plans and compliance
with tree plans may be appealed to the Board.
   (a)   Whenever the Municipal Manager determines that there is a violation of
a tree plan or the maintenance of trees pursuant to such tree plans, the
Municipal Manager shall give notice of such violation to the person responsible
therefor and order compliance. Such notice and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, refer to the section of the Codified
Ordinances that has been violated and order remedial action which, if taken,
will affect compliance with the Code;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance and compliance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator or occupant of the right to appeal the
order; and
      (5)   Be served upon the owner or occupant or his or her agent, in
person, provide that such notice and order shall be deemed to be properly
served upon such owner, occupant or agent if a copy thereof is sent by
certified mail to his or her last known address and a copy is posted in a
conspicuous place in or on the property affected.
   (b)   Any person affected by any notice of violation and order to comply or
revocation or denial of a tree plan may request and be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Board provided that such person files in the Office of the
Municipal Manager, a written petition requesting such hearing and setting forth
the name, address and phone number of the petitioner and a brief statement of
the grounds for such appeal or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any
order issued by the Municipal Manager relating to tree plans. The petition
shall be filed within ten days after the date of the notice of order or the
denial of approval of a tree plan. Upon receipt of such a petition, the Board
shall set a time and place for a hearing before the Board and shall give the
petition written notice thereof. A hearing shall commence within a reasonable
time, not to exceed 15 days after a petition has been filed. At such a hearing,
the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why
any item appearing on such notice and order should be modified or withdrawn.
The failure of the petitioner or his or her representative to appear and state
his or her case at such hearing shall have the same effect if no petition were
filed.
   (c)   After a hearing, the Board shall sustain, modify or withdraw any item
appearing on the notice or order, by a majority vote, depending upon its
findings as to whether or not the ordinances of the Village relating to trees
have been complied with. The petitioner and the Municipal Manager shall be
notified in writing of such findings.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing including the findings and decisions
of the Board and reasons therefor, shall be summarized and reduced to writing
and entered as a matter of public record in the records of the Village and
maintained in the office of the Municipal Manager. Such records shall include a
copy of every notice and order issued in connection with the matter.

§ 1026.19 PENALTY.
   Violations of this chapter shall constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine up to $250 or a sentence of up to 30 days incarceration.
Nothing therein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful actions
as may be necessary to prevent or remedy any violations. Individuals found
guilty of destroying trees in violation of this chapter shall also be required
to pay for the damage or replacement of the trees. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.

thresholds for a substantial change.
Note: For clarity, the definition in this chapter includes only the definition
of a substantial change as it applies to installations in the public right-of-
way. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means
that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are
cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the
cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted wireless support
structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless facilities
not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated
deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site
dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012.

location to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided
the alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of
the right-of- way in or on which the new wireless support structure is
proposed, whichever is greater. The Village also finds that certain locations
and collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and
collocation configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only
be surpassed if in the determination of the Municipal Manager, clear and
convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds
for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement, If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next
preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available,
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the Village right-of- way. If no such wireless support structure is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the Village right-of-way. If no such existing pole
is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the Village right-of-way.
         B.   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 750
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Wireless facilities design.
         A.   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards:
            1.   Wireless support structure and any collocated antennas shall
be limited to 40 feet in height.
            2.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
            3.   New wireless support structures shall have the following
design elements:
               a.    Material - aluminum poles;
               b.    Color - black anodized;
               c.    Diameter - not greater than 12 inches;
               d.    Style - smooth round tapered profile; may be fluted in
certain areas if it better matches existing streetscape design;
               e.   Base - trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier not to exceed six inches above grade if feasible;
               f.    Exception - if the neighborhood context would be better
served by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined
by the Municipal Manager, then such design elements may be substituted with an
alternate design element. Such determination shall be based on the following
factors:
                  i.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a
similar capacity;
                  ii.    The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  iii.    The historical context of a district or specific
site;
                  iv.    A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
         B.   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
            1.   The Village reserves the right to require the following:
               a.    Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to
the extent deemed necessary by the Municipal Manager in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
                  i.    Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a
wireless support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome
that matches the color of the pole on which it is mounted and also conceals the
cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Municipal Manager may
approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, or approve an
alternate color, if in the Municipal Manager's discretion, the side-mounted
antenna or alternate color would be more appropriate given the built
environment, neighborhood character, overall site appearance and would promote
the purposes of this chapter.
                  ii.    GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
            2.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
            3.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna
and as identified by the R.C. § 4939.01(P)(2), shall not exceed 21 cubic feet
in volume per facility.
            4.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small cell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
               a.   Not exceed 21 cubic feet in volume;
               b.   Not exceed 90 inches in height, 20 inches in width, or 20
inches in depth;
               c.   Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on which
it is mounted;
               d.    Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to
which it is mounted;
               e.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               f.   Be mounted on the side of the pole opposite the side from
which the nearest traffic lane's direction of travel approaches the pole. The
Municipal Manager may approve an alternate mounting orientation, if in the
Municipal Manager's discretion, the alternate mounting orientation would be
more appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall
site appearance and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               a.    Material - The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent.
               b.    Material as determined by the Municipal Manager.
               c.    Color - The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of the small cell facility
is better suited to another color, as determined by the Municipal Manager.
               d.    Style - The enclosure shall match the style, or lack
thereof, of the pole on which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of
the small cell facility is better suited to another style, as determined by the
Municipal Manager.
               e.    Coordinated design elements - common enclosures when
located within 3,000 feet of an existing common enclosure shall match the
design elements of the existing common enclosure unless the surrounding context
of the small cell facility is better suited to an alternate design.
            6.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless a waiver is requested and the following conditions
can be satisfied as determined by the Municipal Manager;
               a.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. bus stop shelter), increased costs alone shall not be a consideration. If
a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Municipal Manager shall reserve the
right to require any of the following conditions:
                  i.    Concealed enclosure. All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Municipal Manager.
                  ii.    Smallest size. The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Municipal Manager.
                  iii.    Camouflage. Camouflaging elements may be required.
Such elements may include, but shall not be limited to strategic placement in
less visible or obtrusive locations, placement within an existing streetscape
element, landscape screening, and strategic painting or coating to camouflage
such enclosure or equipment.
                  iv.    The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 36
inches.
            7.   The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other
services on all small cell facilities collocated on new wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure. The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other
services on all small cell facilities collocated on existing wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure, unless it is determined not possible by the Municipal Manager. The
vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services on all small
cell facilities collocated on utility poles shall be mounted to the surface of
the pole within conduit.
            8.   Electric meters, telecommunications demarcation boxes,
grounding equipment, power transfer switches, and cut-off switches shall be
mounted on the same side of the pole as the small cell facilities common
enclosure and shall match the color of the small cell wireless facilities and
the color of the pole on which it is mounted. The Municipal Manager may approve
an alternate mounting orientation or color, if in the Municipal Manager's
discretion, the alternate mounting orientation or alternate color would be more
appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, or overall
site appearance and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
   (c)   Reservation of right-of-way. The Village reserves the right to reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the right-of-way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the Village in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the Village's pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.
   (d)   Independent power and communications sources required. Small cell
facilities located on Village-owned wireless support structures may not use the
same power or communication source providing power and/or communication for the
existing facility original to the purposes of the support structure. The
independent power source must be contained within a separate conduit inside the
support structure. The applicant shall coordinate, establish, maintain and pay
for all power and communication connections with utilities.
   (e)   Undergrounding. Wireless support structures shall be subject to
compliance with the Village's requirements for underground or buried utility
areas unless a waiver has been granted under Design Standards §
1048.05(b)(3)B.6. as stated herein.
   (f)   Nonconformity. A nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation and must
be brought into compliance with all of the provisions of this chapter, and all
other applicable Village laws and ordinances or be removed if any of the
following conditions are present:
      (1)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure or a part of the nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure is altered, modified, relocated, replaced, or changed in any
manner whatsoever;
      (2)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is damaged or deteriorated and requires any process of
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration, and the cost of said
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration exceeds fifty percent of
the small cell facility and/or wireless support structure's replacement cost;
      (3)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is abandoned.
   (g)   Conflict with other provisions. In the event that any other applicable
law or code requires any more restrictive requirements, the most restrictive
requirement shall control.
   (h)   Severability. The provisions of any part of this chapter are
severable. If any provision or subsection, or the application of any provision
or subsection to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining
provisions, subsection, and applications of such ordinance to other persons or
circumstances shall not be made invalid as well. It is declared to be the
intent of this section that the remaining provisions would have been adopted
had such invalid provisions not been included in this chapter when originally
adopted by Village Council.

§ 1248.01 COMPLIANCE GENERALLY.
   In designing the layout of a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with
the requirements and general principles set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.02 COMPLIANCE WITH MASTER PLANS.
   (a)   Thoroughfare Plan. A subdivision layout shall conform to the Official
Thoroughfare Plan if and when such a Plan is adopted by the Planning
Commission. Whenever any existing or proposed thoroughfare, parkway or other
major or collector street designated on the Thoroughfare Plan abuts or
traverses a tract to be subdivided, such part of such right-of-way shall be
platted by the subdivider in the location and at the width indicated on the
Thoroughfare Plan.
   (b)   General Land Use Plan. The layout of the subdivision shall conform to
the Official General Land Use Plan if and when such a Plan is adopted by the
Planning Commission. Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school
site or other public ground shown on such Plan is located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground, if not dedicated
to the Village or the Board of Education, shall be reserved by the subdivider
for acquisition by the Village or the Board, within a period of two years from
the Commission approval of the preliminary drawing, by purchase or other means,
unless released by the Village or the Board. If the Village notifies the
developer of its decision to buy public ground as shown on the General Land Use
Plan within the first year of the time specified in this division, the time
period will automatically be extended by one additional year.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.03 NEIGHBORHOOD PLANS.
   If a tentative plan has been prepared by the Planning Commission for the
neighborhood wherein a proposed subdivision lies, the subdivision layout shall
conform generally to such plan.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.04 STREET LAYOUTS.
   (a)   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares or unsubdivided lands as may be required by the Planning
Commission. Minor residential streets should be so planned as to discourage
their use by nonlocal traffic.
   (b)   Consistency with adjoining streets. The arrangement of streets shall
make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing or proposed
streets in adjoining areas, or their proper projection where adjoining land is
not subdivided, insofar as they are necessary for public requirements.
   (c)   Allowance for hardship to adjoining owners. The street layout shall be
designed so as not to cause a hardship to owners of adjacent property when they
plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. The
Planning Commission may require land to be reserved for future street purposes
to be developed by an adjacent land owner at a later date.
   (d)   Extensions to subdivision boundary lines. Proposed streets shall be
extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented
by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the
most suitable layout of adjacent tracts.
   (e)   Intersections. Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly
at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
   (f)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets at intersections
shall not be allowed unless the distance between such centerline offsets is at
least 200 feet on local and collector streets, 300 feet on secondary
thoroughfares and 500 feet on primary thoroughfares.
   (g)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs may be approved where necessitated by
topography or where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, they are
appropriate for the type of development contemplated. Turnarounds of the
circular type shall be required. Except in unusual circumstances, the
Commission shall not approve a cul-de-sac with a length greater than 700 feet,
and in no case shall such length be greater than 800 feet.
   (h)   Temporary dead-end streets. Except as otherwise provided in these
Subdivision Regulations, temporary dead-end streets may be approved where
necessitated by the layout of the subdivision or staging of development,
provided that temporary paved turnarounds shall be constructed at the end of
such streets in cases where more than eight lots front on such streets. The
widths of rights-of-way or temporary easements shall be the same as that
required for permanent turnarounds. The extra right-of-way in excess of the
street right-of-way shall be vacated upon extension of the temporary street,
and the reconditioning of such street and all surface improvements and front
yards concerned shall be carried out at the expense of the subdivider
responsible for the extension of such temporary dead- end street.
   (I)   Half streets. Dedication of half streets shall not be permitted,
except in special situations which are in the public interest. Where there
exists a dedicated or platted half street adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, it is necessary to promote proper development.
   (j)   Private streets. Except in unusual conditions when held desirable by
the Planning Commission, or in cases permitted in accordance with the Zoning
Code, private streets will not be approved.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.05 BLOCKS.
   (a)   Width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depth, except in the case of approved double frontage lots
abutting a primary thoroughfare.
   (b)   Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,800 feet in length.
   (c)   Crosswalks. Crosswalks shall be suitably located where required by the
Planning Commission to provide adequate pedestrian circulation.
   (d)   Irregularly shaped blocks. Irregularly shaped blocks, including those
indented by cul-de-sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds and adequate
parking space, will be acceptable when properly designed and covered by
agreements as to maintenance of such park areas.
   (e)   Intersecting streets on primary thoroughfares. The number of
intersecting streets along primary thoroughfares shall be held to a minimum.
Wherever practical, blocks along such thoroughfares shall be not less than
1,200 feet in length.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.06 MINIMUM RIGHTS OF WAY FOR STREETS, CROSSWALKS AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Primary thoroughfares and existing highways. Rights-of-way of primary
thoroughfares and existing highways shall be as specified in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan, but not less than 100 feet in any case.

   (g)   Utility Easements. Utility easements, where required, shall be at
least ten feet wide along rear or side lot lines.
   (h)   Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, and open drainage is
to be permitted, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement along each
side of the stream or open drainage course for the purpose of widening,
deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream or open drainage
course for drainage or recreational use.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)

   (a)   Primary and secondary thoroughfares and collector streets. Minimum
widths for primary thoroughfares shall be 58 feet; for secondary thoroughfares,
48 feet; and for collector streets, 38 feet. In cases of primary or secondary
thoroughfares usually requiring pavements wider than the minimum, the matter of
financial and other arrangements for installing such wider pavements or
expanding the pavements at some future date shall be taken up by the developer
with officials having jurisdiction therefor, except as provided in §
1250.04(a)(1).
   (b)   Collector street exceptions. In cases where a collector street does
not front directly on a public school site, or, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, where such street will not provide the shortest and most logical
route from at least 250 dwelling units within the neighborhood, as delineated
in the Official Comprehensive Master Plan, to destinations outside the
neighborhood, a pavement width of 28 feet measured back-to-back of curb may be
permitted. In all cases, the costs of collector streets shall be financed by
the subdivider.
   (c)   Local streets. The minimum width for local streets shall be 30 feet.
The pavement of a turning circle at the end of a cul-de-sac shall have a
minimum outside diameter of 80 feet back-to-back of curb.
   (d)   Alleys and service drives. The minimum width for alleys and service
drives shall be 20 feet, unless planned for one-way directional movement.
   (e)   Sidewalks and crosswalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides
of all streets and within the right-of-way or easement of any crosswalk and
shall have a minimum width of four feet.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
§ 1248.08 STREET GRADES AND CURVES.
   The Planning Commission shall establish standards for all street grades and
curves. Such standards may be changed at any time by a majority vote of the
Commission.
   Street grade and curve standards, as established by the Commission, are
included in Appendix B following the text of these Subdivision Regulations and
shall be complied with in the design and approval of subdivisions.

APPENDIX A: PLAN APPROVAL PROCEDURE
   (a)   Procedure for Approval. In accordance with §
1244.03, the Planning Commission should establish procedures for the
submission, review and approval of all preliminary plans, improvement plans and
record plats. Time requirements for processing, as well as the number of prints
needed for review of various public agencies, should also be included. In cases
where other agencies exercise approval authority, a complete description of
such procedures should also be included.
   (b)   Method for Plan Approval.
      (1)   Preliminary plans. The developer shall work out layout and road
patterns with the County Regional Planning Commission staff and deliver an
approved and initialed plan and three copies thereof to the Village offices for
review by the Village Engineer and the Building Commissioner/Inspector. All
plans submitted to the Village for review shall not be folded, but may be
rolled.
         When such plans are approved, the Village Engineer and Building
Commissioner/Inspector shall submit one signed copy to the Planning Commission
with their approval report and one copy to each Commission member.
         The Commission will discuss and approve the plan after any required
changes are accomplished.
         After approval by the Commission, the developer shall submit seven
copies of the corrected plan to the Village Administrator, to be distributed as
follows: one for the Regional Planning Commission; two for the Village
Engineer; one for the Building Commissioner/Inspector; one for the Planning
Commission; and two for the developer.
      (2)   Water works plan. The developer shall submit two copies of a water
works plan to the Village Administrator for review by the Village Engineer. All
plans submitted to the Village for review shall not be folded, but may be
rolled.
            The Village Engineer shall mark revisions on one copy of the water
works plan and return such copy to the developer. The developer shall make the
necessary revisions on such plan, resubmit two sets of the corrected plan to
the Engineer for Planning Commission approval and submit approved copies of the
corrected plan to the Cincinnati Water Works Department for its approval.
            After approval by the Cincinnati Water Works Department, the
developer shall submit three copies of the final approved plan to the Village
Administrator to be distributed as follows: two for the Village Engineer and
one for the Fire Department.
      (3)   Subdivision improvement plans. Subdivision improvement plans must
follow the approved preliminary plans as to lot layout and road pattern.
            The developer shall deliver three copies of improvement plans,
grading plans and supporting data for sanitary and storm sewer design to the
Village Administrator for review by the Village Engineer. All plans submitted
to the Village for review shall not be folded, but may be rolled.
            The Engineer will mark revisions on one copy of these plans and
supporting data for sanitary and storm sewer design and send them along with
one unmarked copy of each to the Metropolitan Sewer District (M.S.D.) for
review and approval. The District’s Sanitary Engineer will add his or her
notations to the marked copy and return such copy to the developer. The absence
of any required data shall be sufficient cause for immediate rejection by the
Village Engineer.
            The developer shall correct all revisions and send three corrected
copies and the original marked copy to the Metropolitan Sewer District. The
Sanitary Engineer shall review such plans to see that all revisions for
sanitary and storm sewers have been corrected, and if so, he or she will sign
two copies and send them along with the original marked copy to the Village
Engineer.
            The Village Engineer shall review such plans to see that all other
revisions have been corrected, and if so, he or she will approve and sign such
plans. If corrections are not satisfactory to the Village Engineer, he or she
will send one marked copy to the developer with instructions to correct the
resubmitted plans.
            As a matter of policy the Village Engineer may, in all cases
mentioned in this division, correspond directly with the developer’s
consultant, with the developer’s permission in writing. The Village Engineer
will submit one signed copy to the Planning Commission with his or her approval
report.
            The Commission will discuss and approve the plans after any
required changes are accomplished.
            To ensure placement on the Commission agenda, all plans which are
presumably correct must be submitted to the Village Engineer at least two weeks
prior to the Commission agenda closing date.
            The developer shall submit ten copies of the approved plan to the
Secretary of the Planning Commission for signature. Such signed prints will be
distributed by the Village Administrator as follows: two for the Metropolitan
Sewer District, one for Cincinnati Gas and Electric, one for the County Board
of Health, one for the Cincinnati Water Works Department, two for the Village
Engineer, one for the Planning Commission, and two for the developer.
      (4)   Record plats. The developer shall submit two copies of the record
plat to the Village Administrator for review by the Village Engineer. All plans
submitted to the Village for review shall not be folded, but may be rolled.
            The Village Engineer will mark revisions on one copy and send such
copy back to the developer. The developer shall correct all revisions and send
the marked copy and corrected copies to the Engineer. The Engineer shall review
the plans to see that all revisions have been corrected, and if so, he or she
shall sign and approve the plans. If the corrections are not satisfactory to
the Engineer, he or she shall send one marked copy to the developer with
instructions to correct and resubmit the plans. The Engineer will send two
copies of the corrected plans to the Metropolitan Sewer District.
            The Engineer shall determine the amount of bond required, including
predicted inflation increase, if any, for roadway improvements. The
Metropolitan Sewer District shall determine the amount of the bond required, if
any, for underground improvements and send this bond amount to the Engineer.
The Engineer shall notify the developer of the total amount of bond required,
if any. The Engineer may elect to determine the amount of the bond for storm
sewers.
            The developer shall post the necessary bond with the Finance
Director, who will notify the Village Engineer, in writing, that the bond has
been received.
            As a matter of policy, the Engineer may, in all cases mentioned in
this division, correspond directly with the developer’s consultant, with the
developer’s permission in writing.
            The Engineer shall submit his or her approval report, one corrected
copy of the record plat and the original corrected tracing to the Planning
Commission, and shall submit one copy to each member after all bonds have been
received.
            The Commission will approve the record plat for recordation and the
Secretary of the Commission will sign the original tracing.
            The original polyester film tracing will be given to the developer
so it can be recorded, and five copies of it will be given to the Village
Administrator for distribution as follows: one for the Planning Commission; two
for the Engineer; one for the Metropolitan Sewer District; and one for the
Cincinnati Water Works Department.
            After the streets indicated on his or her record plat have been
accepted by the Village, the developer shall submit the original tracing to the
Village Administrator. The Engineer shall have the Clerk of Council sign this
tracing and return it to the developer. The developer shall furnish the Village
Administrator five copies of the final record plat for distribution, as
mentioned in this division. The Planning Commission meeting agenda closing date
shall be ten days prior to the regular Commission meeting.
APPENDIX B: STREET GRADE AND CURVE STANDARDS
   (a)   Establishment. In accordance with §
1248.08, the Planning Commission shall establish standards for all street
grades and curves.
   As a means of coordinating development with the standards of the County, the
Planning Commission hereby establishes all County street grades and curve
standards as requirements for all subdivisions within the Village, provided
that any amendment to County standards dated after the adoption of this
Appendix (Ordinance 22-1979, passed September 11, 1979) shall not take effect
in the Village without prior approval of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Specifications.
      (1)   Curves. The minimum radius of curvature on the centerline shall be
500 feet for primary or secondary thoroughfares, 200 feet for collector streets
and 100 feet for minor residential streets.
      (2)   Grades. Maximum grades shall not exceed six percent for primary or
secondary thoroughfares or twelve percent for collector or local streets. The
minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.8 percent. Grades across intersections
shall not exceed four percent except at the discretion of the Village Engineer
and/or the County Engineer.
            Changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum
length equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in rate of grade for
thoroughfares, and one-half such minimum length for minor or local streets.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
APPENDIX C: ENGINEERING RULES AND REGULATIONS; BACKFILL REQUIREMENTS
   (a)   Engineering Rules and Regulations. In all cases not specifically
covered by these Subdivision Regulations and appendices thereto, the
appropriate sections of the existing County Engineering Rules and Regulations,
as amended, shall remain in effect. However, all amendments to the County
Engineering Rules and Regulations taking effect after the passage of these
Subdivision Regulations (Ordinance 22-1979, passed September 11, 1979) shall
not be binding, unless approved by the Planning Commission and adopted by
Council.
   The requirements for backfilling of trenches set forth in division (b)
hereof are an exception to this division.
   (b)   Backfill Requirements. Excavations for any purpose under street
pavements, sidewalks or areas to be paved shall be backfilled with granular
material meeting the requirements for 310 material as per the State
Construction and Material Specifications. No paving operation shall be
permitted until all excavations have been backfilled, compacted, inspected and
approved.
   All trenches made in the subgrade of the proposed roadbed or sidewalk area,
and all trenches parallel to the roadway where the edge of the trench is nearer
than one foot to the edge of the proposed pavement or the proposed curb, shall
be backfilled with granular material. All transverse trenches shall be
backfilled two feet outside the limits of the proposed roadbed of the pavement.
   Granular material used for bedding and backfilling shall be compacted, with
mechanical tampers, under and around the conduit and to the top of the trench
in layers not to exceed four inches in thickness. Granular material may be
compacted with water if satisfactory drainage is provided for the free water.
When compacting with water, the granular material may be deposited in ponded
water, or it may be placed in layers not to exceed twelve inches loose depth
and each layer thoroughly saturated with water. The material shall be filled
and compacted to the final grade, line and cross-section of the subgrade as
shown on the improvement plan. The granular material shall be compacted to 95
percent of its maximum laboratory dry weight.
   Trenches in areas in the unimproved portion of the right-of-way shall be
backfilled with suitable soil placed in layers not to exceed four inches in
thickness and compacted with mechanical tampers. The soil shall be compacted to
95 percent of its maximum laboratory dry weight. Granular material may be used
in backfilling such trenches. The granular material shall be placed and
compacted as mentioned in this division.
(Ord. 22-1979, passed 9-11-1979)
CHAPTER D: DITCHES, CHANNELS AND SWALES
   (a)   Generally. As used in this appendix, “ditches” means open watercourses
for the purpose of carrying water overland to or in lieu of closed conduits or
to other ditches, channels or swales. “Ditches” includes channels and swales.
   Ditches shall be shown on the improvement plan as part of the drawings and
in profile at the same scale as storm and sanitary sewers.
   The plan shall also contain a typical section of the ditch, showing width of
bottom, side slopes and type and dimensions of lining.
   (b)   Design. The design of ditches shall consist of the following:
      (1)   Hydraulically determining the depth and configuration of ditch
necessary to carry the design peak flow at the design velocity. The cross-
section of the ditch shall be as shown in the standard drawings.
      (2)   Determining the type and dimensions of the ditch lining needed to
maintain proper erosion control to prevent scour or needed to prevent
undesirable sedimentation.
   (c)   Design Criteria. All ditches shall be designed for the ultimate use of
the land and in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Review information. The information necessary for proper review is
the station on the ditch of the point being considered; discharge (Q); velocity
(v); coefficient of friction (n); depth (d); and the type, limits and
dimensions of ditch lining.
      (2)   Design sheets. The ditch design sheet recommended by the Village
Engineer, or a reasonable fascimile thereof, shall be used in the design and
shall accompany the plans submitted for review.
      (3)   Points of design. Each ditch shall be checked for the information
required in division (c)(1) hereof at each point where a concentrated discharge
enters the ditch, at each point where the type of ditch lining changes, at each
change in grade and at various points throughout its length at a maximum of
400-foot intervals. The entire reach of ditch shall be designed for the total
discharge at the lower end of the reach.
      (4)   Surface run-off. The quantity of surface run-off or discharge shall
be computed by the rational formula Q=ciA.
         A.   Coefficient of run-off (c). A weighted value of c shall be
computed for each contributing area using the following values:
                     0.9      -   roof and hard surfaced areas
                     0.7      -   steep grassed areas (4:1 or steeper)
                     0.4      -   for unpaved areas, lawns and yards
         B.   Intensity of precipitation (I). The intensity of rainfall shall
be obtained by use of the rainfall duration-versus-intensity chart D-802 - Area
D - Ohio Department of Highways Location and Design Manual. The duration of
rainfall shown on the graph is the concentration time or an estimate of the
time for the water to flow from the most remote part of the drainage area to
the point in the ditch being analyzed. Such time can best be estimated by the
use of the overland flow chart found in Volume One of the Date Book for Civil
Engineers by Seelye. The minimum time to the first point shall be 15 minutes.
         C.   Design frequency. The design frequency for depth shall be a ten-
year storm and for velocity a two-year storm, except where existing or proposed
buildings would be flooded, then in which case a 25 year design frequency shall
be used for depth.
      (5)   Hydraulic design. The ditch will be hydraulically designed by the
use of Manning’s formula for open-channel flow. In order to expedite the
determination of velocity and depth, the charts contained in the Bureau of
Public Roads, Hydraulic Design series No. 3, “Design Charts for Open Channel
Flow” may be used.
         A.   Coefficient of friction (n). The coefficient of friction shall be
determined as follows:
                     n =      .015 paved lining of precast concrete riprap
                     n =      .03 bare earth (seeding)
                     n =      .04 sodding of grouted riprap
                     n =      .08 dumped rock channel protection
         B.   Allowable velocities. The maximum allowable velocities for
various linings shall be as follows:
                     Bare earth (seeding) - to 2.5 feet per second (fps)
                     Sodding - 2.5 fps to 5.5 fps
               Dumped rock channel protection - Over 5.5 fps, or paved lining,
precast concrete riprap or grouted riprap
         C.   Minimum grades or velocity. The minimum grade on any ditch shall
be 0.3 percent. On occasion it may be necessary to establish a minimum velocity
to preclude any undesirable sedimentation in the ditch. These minimum
velocities will be at the discretion of the Village Engineer and will be
handled individually.
   (d)   Grading Plan. The developer shall furnish a grading plan to the
Village Engineer unless specifically advised otherwise. If the grading plan is
not submitted, the improvement plan review will be delayed and acceptance of
the subdivision will be postponed until the grading plan can be reviewed.
   (e)   Culverts and Storm Sewers.
      (1)   Generally. Culverts and storm sewers that begin as an open pipe
shall be checked for headwater depth. The headwater depth shall be such that no
property damage will result at the design storm and all water shall be
contained within the established drainage easement.
      (2)   Inlet and outlet ditches. Inlet and outlet ditches for culverts and
storm sewers shall be hydraulically checked, and where, in the opinion of the
Village Engineer, excessive velocities exist, erosion control shall be
provided. The centerline profile of the existing ditch at the inlet and outlet
of a culvert or storm sewer shall be shown at least 100 feet beyond the point
of the beginning or end of the work.
   (f)   Interpretation and Extra Data. The interpretation of this appendix is
the sole responsibility of the Village Engineer. The Engineer may, at his or
her discretion, require any other data he or she deems necessary for a proper
review.

   Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses designated as
conditionally permitted in a particular use district. Such particular use may
be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not without consideration
in each case of the effect of the use upon neighboring land and the effect the
neighboring land will have on the use. The application of the planning
standards for determining the location and extent of such use is a planning

and condition of all adjacent uses and structures and the consistency therewith
of the proposed Conditional Use and any potential nuisances.

      (18)   Such other information as required by the Planning Commission to
determine the conformance with this Code.
   (c)   Standards for conditional use. The Commission shall not grant a
conditional use unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific written
findings of fact directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it,
that support conclusions that:
      (1)   The proposed conditional use will comply with all applicable
regulations of this Code, including lot size requirements, development

the standards set out in this chapter to reduce or minimize potentially
injurious effects of such conditional uses upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Code.
   (e)   Period of validity.
      (1)   A Conditional Use Permit granted by the Commission shall terminate
at the end of one year from the date on which the Commission grants the

§ 1254.09 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Uses other than those specifically mentioned in this Zoning Code as
permitted uses in each district may also be allowed therein, provided that, in
the judgment of the Planning Commission, such other uses are of a similar
character to those mentioned and will have no adverse influence or no more
adverse influence on adjacent properties, the neighborhood or the community
than the permitted uses specifically mentioned for the district, in accordance
with the following standards.
   (a)   The determination as to whether a main or accessory use is similar to
uses permitted by right shall be considered as an expansion of the use
regulations of the district and not as a variance applying to a particular
situation. Any main use found similar shall thereafter be included in the
enumeration of main uses permitted by right. In the case of an accessory use,
the accessory use shall thereafter be permitted as accessory by right in that
district to the main use to which it is accessory. Application for similar use
shall be made to the Planning Commission by submitting a site plan as set forth
in §
1254.12, Site Plan Review.
   The Planning Commission shall grant or deny the similar use permit utilizing
the following standards:
      (1)   That such use is found to be compatible with the intent statement
of the district for which it is being considered;
      (2)   That such use is not listed in any other main classification of
permitted uses, or in the case of accessory uses that the use is not listed as
an accessory use to the main use in any other district;
      (3)   That such main use conforms to the basic characteristics of the
classification to which it is to be added, and is more appropriate thereto than
to any other main classification;
      (4)   That the use does not create dangers to the health or safety, and
does not create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or
other objectionable influences to an extent greater that normally resulting
from other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added; and
      (5)   That such use does not create traffic to a greater extent than the
other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
   (b)   If approved, the use shall be identified as a conditional permitted
use, subject to the standards and regulations of §
1254.08, Conditional Use Permits, in this Zoning Code unless a formal Zoning
Code text amendment is conducted, as per §
1254.11, Amendments, incorporating such use as a principal permitted or
accessory permitted use.

   Site plan review shall be as follows:
   (a)   Applicability. This section shall apply to new property development
and any collective substantial expansion of existing structures, except for
individual single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings (duplexes) and
parking lots of five spaces or smaller. Substantial expansion of existing
structures shall be defined as an increase of the existing structure by 20
percent or more in gross floor area. Furthermore, no building shall be erected
or structurally altered on any lot or parcel in zones where a site plan is
required, except in accordance with the regulations of this section and an
approved site plan. No Zoning Certificate or Zoning Certificate of Compliance
shall be issued prior to the approval of a site plan.
   (b)   Contents of Site Plan. Before a permit is issued for construction,
copies of a site plan at a scale no smaller than 1 inch to 100 feet (1"=100')
shall be filed with the Zoning Officer setting forth, identifying and locating
the following:
      (1)   The total area in the development in square feet and acres.
      (2)   The existing zoning of the property in question and all adjacent
properties including properties located across a street from the subject
property.
      (3)   All right-of-way and easement lines located on or adjacent to the
property which is proposed to be continued, created, relocated or abandoned.
      (4)   Existing topography with a maximum of ten-foot contour intervals.
      (5)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not larger than five feet.
      (6)   The locations of all existing and proposed buildings in the
described parcels, the uses to be contained therein and the total number of
buildings including dimensions, heights, gross floor area and number of
stories.
      (7)   Location and dimension of all curb cuts, driving lanes, off-street
parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, angles of stalls,
grades, surfacing materials, drainage plans, and illumination of facilities.
      (8)   All sidewalks and other open areas.
      (9)   Location of all walls, fences, and buffer yards.
      (10)   Location, size, height, colors, typeset, materials, lighting, and
orientation of all signs.
      (11)   Location of all existing proposed streets, highways and alleys.
      (12)   All existing and proposed water and sanitary sewer lines
indicating pipe sizes, types and grades.

determine the conformance with this Code.
   (c)   Site Plan Review guidelines. The following principles shall guide the
exercise of site planning review by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   The use or expansion is in conformance with the most recent
Woodlawn Master Plan.
      (2)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site shall be
incorporated into the plan and the development to the greatest extent feasible.
      (3)   Buildings and open spaces should generally be in proportion and in
scale with existing structures and spaces in the area within 300 feet of the
development site.
      (4)   A site that has an appearance of being congested, overbuilt or
cluttered can evolve into a blighting influence and therefore such should not
be congested, over built or cluttered.
      (5)   Open spaces should be linked together.
      (6)   Natural separation should be preserved or created on the site by
careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural
features and open spaces for separation. Existing vegetation removal should be
kept to a minimum.
      (7)   Screening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing
landscaping, fences or walls to enclose internal areas.
      (8)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion. Long,
unbroken building facades should be avoided.
      (9)   In connection with the siting of buildings taller than one story,
the location should be oriented to maximize the privacy of the occupants of
adjacent buildings.
      (10)   Short loop streets, cul-de-sacs and residential streets should be
used for access to low- density residential land uses in order to provide a
safer living environment and a stronger sense of neighborhood identity.
      (11)   Street location and design should conform to existing topographic
characteristics. Cutting and filling shall be minimized in the construction of
streets. Flat as possible grades should be utilized proximate to intersections.
      (12)   Pedestrian circulation in nonresidential areas should be arranged
so that off-street parking areas are located within a convenient walking
distance of the use being served. Handicapped parking should be located as near
as possible to be accessible to the structure. Pedestrian and vehicular
circulation should be separated as much as possible, through crosswalks
designated by pavement markings, signalization or complete grade separation.
      (13)   Path and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there
is a good sight distance along the road, preferably away from sharp bends or
sudden changes in grade.
      (14)   Parking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to
provide safe, convenient ingress and egress. Whenever possible there should be
a sharing or curb cuts of more than one facility. Parking areas should be
screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect
circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
      (15)   Drive-through establishments such as restaurants and banks should
be located to allow enough automobile waiting space for peak hour operation
without interference with other parking lot circulations.
   (d)   Action by Planning Commission for Site Plan Review. Upon submission of
the complete application as outlined under §
1254.12(b) for site plan review to the Zoning Officer, the application shall be
transmitted to the Planning Commission within 30 days, where they shall review
the site plan pursuant to this section. A public hearing shall be held by the
Planning Commission in reviewing a site plan. Notice shall be given not less
than ten days prior to the date of public hearing, by posting notice on or near
the parcel of land involved, at places which will be conspicuous to the
neighboring properties and to the public, by mailing notice to the adjacent
property owners, and by publishing notice in a newspaper of general
circulation. The Planning Commission may approve, disapprove or approve with
modifications the site plan as submitted.
   The Planning Commission shall act upon all site plans within 30 days after
the receipt of the complete application from the Zoning Officer. Within the
said 30-day period, a majority of the members of the Planning Commission
present at a meeting thereof may vote to extend the said period for a period of
time not to exceed an additional 60 days.
   (e)   Appeal of Planning Commission decision for Site Plan Review. An appeal
can be made to the Woodlawn Council regarding a decision by the Planning
Commission regarding approval of a site plan review. An applicant, or other
aggrieved party, may appeal to the Woodlawn Council to evaluate the decision of
the Planning Commission as related to a site plan review application. The
Council may uphold the decision of the Planning Commission, overturn the
decision of the Planning Commission or modify the decision of the Planning
Commission. An affirmative vote of five members of the Council is required to
overturn or modify the recommendation of the Planning Commission. Appeals to
the Planning Commission decision shall be made within 30 days of action by the

provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest provided. Such variances shall be granted only in such cases

secured and substantial justice done. Variances shall not be granted for uses
not permitted in the zoning district applicable to the property.

or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;

substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;

         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (c)   Every variance granted or denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on testimony and evidence
and specifying the reason for granting or denying the variance.

time of enactment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013),
the use authorized thereon and the other district requirements applying to the
least restricted portion of such lot under this Zoning Code shall be considered

determined by Zoning Officer. When the streets or alleys on the ground differ
from the streets or alley on the Zoning Map, the Planning Commission may apply
the Zoning District designations on the map to the property on the ground in

   (b)   Territory annexed to or consolidated with the Municipality subsequent
to the effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 17-2013, passed 9-24-
2013), shall, upon the effective date of such annexation or consolidation,
become a part of the R-S District, provided that such territory is not
currently subject to County or Township zoning regulations at the time of the
annexation. Such districting shall be temporary and the Planning Commission
shall recommend to Council, within one year from such date of the annexation or
consolidation, a final zoning district designation on the official Zoning Map
for the annexed territory. However, nothing shall prevent the Commission from
recommending such final zoning map at the time of annexation and consolidation.
   (c)   Upon annexation of territory which is subject to County or Township
zoning regulations at the time of annexation, the zoning regulations in effect
shall remain in full force and shall be enforced by the respective County or
Township zoning officials until the Woodlawn Municipal Council, upon

§ 1288.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of the Planned Unit Development District to permit an
applicant, through consultation with the Planning Commission and Council, to
develop a site according to a plan which may supersede normal zoning
requirements of a particular zoning district(s) through an overlay process. The
uses approved within a Planned Unit Development must conform to the uses as
specified in the existing zoning district. Planned Unit Developments would
permit creative site planning and permit an applicant to incorporate such
amenities as common open space into the overall site design. The Council may
approve Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning based on the guidelines and
procedures in this chapter.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.02 TYPES OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   A Planned Unit Development may be approved within any zoning district,
provided that the use(s) approved in the development plan by Council for the
Planned Unit Development complies with those uses identified as permitted or
conditionally permitted within the existing zoning district. For example, an
applicant can request approval for a Planned Unit Development within an R-
2 Single-Family Medium- Density Residence District or I-P Industrial Park
District; the subsequent designation would be R-2-PUD or I-P-PUD and would
permit the uses in those respective districts.
   (b)   The Planned Unit Development shall be comprised of a parcel or parcels
of land not less than two contiguous acres in size.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.03 REQUIRED OPEN SPACE.
   Required open space in a Planned Unit Development shall be regulated as
follows:
   (a)   There shall be reserved a minimum land area of 20 percent of the
overall tract for use as open space.
   (b)   This open space may include such areas as: pedestrian walkways, park
land, open areas, drainage ways, greenbelts and other lands of essentially open
character. Preferred open space includes: woodland, stream corridors and other
naturally preserved areas.
   (c)   If common open space is provided, ownership of this common open space
shall be transferred to a legally established Homeowners Association, or deeded
with permanent restrictions for its preservation, or other method approved by
the Municipality, and the proper legal documents necessary for such transfer be
prepared by the owner(s) and approved by the Municipal Law Director.
   (d)   The common open space shall be usable by residents/occupants of the
Planned Unit Development and shall not consist of isolated or fragmented pieces
of land which would serve no useful purpose.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.04 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
   The following procedures shall be followed in applying for rezoning to a PUD
District.
   (a)   Application submission. An applicant shall submit a complete
application requesting that the Zoning District Map be amended to rezone the
subject property as a PUD Overlay. Such applications shall be processed,
noticed, and heard in a manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (b)   Informal consultation. Applicants are encouraged to engage in informal
consultations with the Zoning Officer and Municipal Administrator prior to
preparing plans. No statement or representation by staff or Planning
Commission, however, shall be binding.
   (c)   Concept Plan. Concept Plan contents are established in §
1288.05, Required Contents of the Concept Plan.
   (d)   Preliminary and Final Development Plan. An applicant may submit a
Preliminary Development Plan, and subsequently submit a Final Development Plan
for any portion of the approved Preliminary Development Plan that the applicant
wishes to develop. The applicant may also submit a combined Preliminary and
Final Development Plan as identified in §
1288.09, Preliminary and Final Development Plan Procedure.
   The Planning Commission or Council may determine that the review of the
Planned Unit Development submission requires the assistance of engineers,
architects, planners or attorneys to assist in its evaluation of the
Preliminary or Final Development Plan. In such event, the Planning Commission
or Council may require that the applicant pay the fees of such persons so
retained to assist the Planning Commission or Council. By the submission of an
application for Preliminary or Final Development Plan approval, the applicant
agrees to pay such fees.
   (e)   Zoning Certificate. No Zoning Certificate shall be issued for any
property for which a rezoning is requested and no construction shall begin
until the Final Development Plan is approved as per the requirements in this
chapter.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.05 REQUIRED CONTENTS OF THE CONCEPT PLAN.

         M.   Other information as may be required by the Municipality for
review.
      (2)   Time schedule of projected development if construction is to extend
beyond a two-year time period.
      (3)   All necessary legal documentation relating to the transfer of
common open space, if proposed, to the legally established Homeowners
Association or protection of common open space, or other mechanism approved by
the Municipality.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall study the application and Concept Plan
and shall hold a public hearing within 35 days of the time of application.
Following this public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a report to
the Municipal Council within 35 days recommending approval or disapproval and
the reasons therefor. The Planning Commission may explicitly impose special
conditions relating to the planned unit development with regard to type and
extent of public improvements, maintenance of common open space, and any other
pertinent development characteristics as needed in making a determination. The
time period for review may be extended if agreed upon by the applicant.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.06 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE CONCEPT PLAN.
   Upon receipt of the report of the Planning Commission, the Municipal Council
shall study and review the proposed concept plan and shall approve or
disapprove the application for rezoning on the basis of: (1) all application
submission requirements have been satisfied; and (2) finding that the following
specific conditions are met:
   (a)   That each individual section or phase of development, as well as the
total development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained.
   (b)   That the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not
be achieved under other zoning districts in these regulations.
   (c)   That the internal streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and
adequate to carry anticipated traffic.
   (d)   That the minimum open space area has been reserved, a means has been
established to maintain the area, and is either to be dedicated to the
Municipality, be transferred to a legally established Homeowners’ Association
or other legally established entity, or other mechanism approved by the
Municipality.
   (e)   That any part of a Planned Unit Development not used for structures,
parking and loading areas or streets shall be landscaped or designated as
natural open space.
   (f)   That the Planned Unit Development is in conformance with the Woodlawn
Master Plan, as may be amended from time to time.
   (g)   The development will not impose an undue burden on public services and
facilities such as fire and police protection.
   (h)   That the density of each individual phase of the Planned Unit
Development, as well as the density of the entire project shall not exceed the
maximum allowable density as permitted in the underlying districts, except as
provided for in §
1288.07, Increase in Density.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.07 INCREASE IN DENSITY.
   An increase in density of 15 percent may be permitted over the maximum
allowable density of the underlying zoning district(s) upon review and approval
by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.08 PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL ACTION ON CONCEPT PLAN.
   Council shall have 45 days to hold a public hearing and consider the
recommendation of Planning Commission. The time frame for review shall begin
when it has been determined by the Zoning Officer that a complete application
has been submitted with the correct fee as established by Council.
   Action by the Planning Commission and the Council shall be as follows:
   (a)   If from the facts presented, the Council is unable to make the
necessary findings specified in §
1288.06, Conditions of Approval of the Concept Plan, the application shall be
denied or returned to the applicant for clarification. In taking action, the
Planning Commission and Council may deny the Concept Plan or may recommend
approval of said plan subject to specified amendments.
   If the application is approved by Council, the approval of the Concept Plan
shall be limited to the general acceptability of the land uses proposed,
density levels and their interrelationship, and shall not be construed to
endorse precise location of uses, configuration of parcels, or engineering
feasibility which are to be determined in subsequent preparation of preliminary
and final development plans.
   Approval of the Concept Plan shall constitute the approval of the creation
of a separate PUD Planned Unit Development Zoning District. The new zoning
designation shall incorporate the existing zoning classification (e.g. R-2-
PUD).
   (b)   At the time of adopting any ordinance establishing a PUD District, the
Council shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant, which will
ensure the accomplishment of the public improvements and reservation of common
open space of the public improvements shown on the approved Concept Plan. The
developer shall post a bond in the amount determined by the Municipality to
ensure completion of the necessary improvements should the developer fail to
complete such improvements as agreed upon.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1288.09 PRELIMINARY AND FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   Once the Concept Plan has been approved by the Planning Commission and
Council, Preliminary and Final Development Plans for each section of the
overall planned unit development landholding must each be reviewed and approved
by the Planning Commission prior to the issuance of any Zoning Certificate of
Compliance by the Zoning Officer.
   The Preliminary and Final Development Plans shall be in accordance with the

advertising matter or which are not an integral part of the sign message shall
not be included in the computation of surface area (See illustrations on
following page).
   (b)   The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point.
   (c)   In the case of irregularly shaped three dimensional signs the area of
the display surface shall be measured on the plane of the largest vertical
cross- section.
   (d)   The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical
distance between the top part of the sign to the elevation of the ground
beneath the sign prior to construction, excluding additional elevation added by
creation of berming or mounding. If the grade prior to construction cannot be
determined, the elevation of the base of the sign shall be computed using the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the premises,
whichever is lower.

with respect to each category. Nonresidential Districts shall include the D-
1 Downtown District, the I-P Industrial Park District, Glendale Milford
Corridor Overlay District, the Springfield Pike Overlay District, the C- C
Civic Center District, and the O-S Open Space District.
   All other provisions of this shall apply to such categories, where
applicable.
   (a)   Wall signs. The owner or occupant of any commercial, business,
industrial or institutional use located in a nonresidential district may erect
and maintain, a wall sign, either illuminated or non- illuminated, for the
business or service that is being conducted in the building on which the sign
is posted.
      (1)   Such signs may be attached to the exterior walls or other vertical
surfaces of such buildings but may not extend beyond the parapet of such
building.
      (2)   The face of such signs shall be parallel to the face of the
building.
      (3)   The total permissible wall sign area on a building shall not exceed
10 percent of the front building face area. For example, if the front building
face was 1,200 square feet (80 feet in length by 15 feet in height), the total
permissible square footage for wall signs shall be 120 square feet.
      (4)   No portion of any wall sign shall project more than one foot beyond
the face of the building, nor extend beyond the end of the building face.
      (5)   No building shall have a sign or lettering painted directly on the
building surfaces.
      (6)   No building shall have a roof-mounted sign, except for signs
mounted on the face of a mansard roof.
      (7)   A property owner may allocate up to 50 percent of the allowable
total wall sign area to a building wall other than the front wall of the
building, however, in no case shall the total wall sign area for the entire
building exceed 10 percent of the front building face.
      (8)   No wall sign shall exceed 150 square feet in area.
      (9)   When there more is one building on a lot, the allowable sign area
may be distributed among the buildings so long as the maximum permitted sign
area is not exceeded.
   (b)   Ground signs. A ground sign shall be set on the ground or mounted on a
foundation which is set directly on or into the ground. Materials used for the
base of the sign should be similar in material or color to the principal
building on the lot.
      (1)   Height and setback - requirements for ground signs. No portion of
any ground sign may be closer than five feet to any property line. No portion
of any such sign may be closer than 15 feet to any street right-of-way. All

No portion of any such sign shall exceed six feet in height.
   (c)   Distance between ground signs. No ground sign shall be closer than 50
feet to any other such sign. Distance shall be measured on a straight line
directly between such signs.
   (d)   Number of signs permitted. Every commercial, business or industrial
use or multiple development located in a nonresidential district, the road or
street frontage of whose premises measures 100 feet or more, may erect and
maintain one ground sign. As used in this section, “multiple development” means
a shopping center or other nonresidential development containing two or more
separate uses in one building or in a collection of buildings located on one
tract or parcel of real estate so as to give the visual impression of a unified
development. In the case of a use or multiple developments located on a corner
lot, the minimum frontage shall be computed by adding together the frontages on
each abutting street or road. Every commercial, business or industrial use or
multiple developments whose street frontage is less than 100 feet may erect a
sign which conforms to the regulations provided in §
1292.04(a) for professional signs.
   (e)   Number of ground signs permitted. Shall be as follows:
      (1)   Every commercial, business or industrial use or multiple

401 to 800 feet  Two signs
801 feet or more Three signs
 
      (2)   In the case of a user or multiple development located on a corner
lot, the aforesaid minimum frontage shall be computed by adding together the
frontages on each abutting street or road.
      (3)   If the premises upon which a ground sign is erected fronting on
more than one public street, other than a corner lot, the street frontage
nearest the sign(s) shall be used in determining the maximum number of
permitted signs on such streets.
   (f)   Display surface area for ground signs. The aggregate area of any
display surface of a ground sign may not exceed one square foot for each linear
foot of street frontage of the premises upon which such sign is located,
provided that in no event shall such sign have a single face area exceeding 80
square feet, nor shall the total area of all display surfaces exceed 160 square
feet for ground signs. If the premises upon which a ground sign is erected
front on more than one public street, other than a corner lot, the longest of
such frontages may be used in determining the maximum permitted sign area in
accordance with this subsection. However, in the case of a multiple
development, the permitted total aggregate area of display surfaces of a ground
sign shall include all of the display surfaces of any individual signs
identifying separate uses in such multiple developments which may be attached
to such ground sign. The allowable area of a ground sign may include a section
for changeable letters. Such area shall not exceed 50 percent of the sign area.
   (g)   Motor vehicle service stations and motor vehicle filling stations.
Motor vehicle service stations and filling stations may have, in addition to
the signs permitted and regulated in this section, an additional area for

attachment to the ground.
      (3)   Where the required landscaped area is adjacent to a paved surface
accessible to vehicular traffic, a raised curb suitable to prevent the
encroachment of vehicles is required. The minimum horizontal distance between
the face of any required curb and any part of the sign is 36 inches.
      (4)   The landscaped area shall include live plantings that provide year
around coverage and shall be maintained at all times. The use of concrete,
asphalt or other paved surface inside the required landscaped area beneath the
sign is prohibited with the exception of the supports for the base of the sign.
      (5)   Landscaping shall include living plant material. The use of grass,
crushed rock, mulch or stone by itself shall not be considered landscaping. An
example of landscaping is identified in the illustration below:

   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent or alleviate the congestion of the
public street, to minimize any detrimental effects of parking lots on adjacent
properties, to enhance parking lots with landscape elements for improved
traffic circulation and visual amenities and to promote the safety and welfare
of the public. To accomplish this purpose minimum requirements are established,
while more landscaping may be included depending on site specific conditions.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1294.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Provision of spaces. When applicable in all districts, in connection
with every use, there shall be provided at the time any building or structure
is erected, enlarged or increased in capacity or has a change of use, off-
street parking spaces for motor vehicles in accordance with this chapter.
      (1)   New building or structure. The off- street parking and loading
requirements of this chapter shall apply to any application for a permit for
the erection of a new building.
      (2)   Alteration, expansion or change in use. For an alteration,
expansion or change of use of an existing building; or for an alteration,
development or change of land use that requires more parking; or for changes of
the capacity of an existing parking area or parking structure the off-street
parking and loading requirements of this chapter shall apply only to the area
of the alteration, addition or change of use.
   Such required space(s) shall be provided with vehicular access to a street
or alley. This space shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any
manner unless written approval is provided by the Planning Commission.
   Off-street parking spaces are not required for uses in any building existing
at the time of adoption of this Code where no off-street parking had been
provided previously, unless there is a change use or an enlargement of the
building or structure as identified above.
   (b)   Maintenance. The duty to provide and maintain all such areas shall be
the joint responsibilities of the owner, operator and lessee of the use for
which parking lots are required. Off-street parking areas shall be maintained
in good condition without holes and free of all trash, abandoned or junk
vehicles, weeds and other rubbish.
   (c)   Plan review. For any off-street parking area required under this
chapter a plan shall be submitted with the application for a Zoning Permit to
the Zoning Officer to review for compliance with these regulations and for any
other applicable regulations. Any such parking plan shall show the number of
parking spaces, the arrangement of parking aisles, the location of driveway
entrances, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, the location or
typical location of sidewalks, wheel stops, lighting and curbs on or adjacent
to the property, the location of utilities, barriers, shelters, and signs, the
location of landscaped areas and the types and location of vegetation to be
planted in them, typical cross-sections of pavement, storm water drainage
facilities, and any other relevant information requested by the Zoning Officer.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1294.03 NUMBER OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   Except as otherwise provided in this section, off- street parking spaces for
each new principal use on a lot shall be provided according to the units of
measurement indicated for that use in §
1294.08, Required Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces.
   (a)   Computation of required spaces. The following provision shall govern
the computation of the number of off-street parking spaces required:
      (1)   Fractions. When determination of the number of required parking
spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction 1/2 or
less shall be disregarded and any fraction over 1/2 shall require one parking
space.
      (2)   Bench seating calculation. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and
other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or
other similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating facilities
shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for
off- street parking facilities.
      (3)   Use of “Maximum”. When parking spaces are required on the basis of
the number of faculty, staff, students or employees, the maximum number present
at any one time shall govern. The “maximum number” shall be the same as the
“maximum occupancy” as identified on the Building Permit or as identified by
the Fire Chief.
      (4)   Interpretation. For uses not expressly listed in §
1294.08, parking spaces shall be provided on the same basis as required for the
most similar and restrictive listed use as determined by the Zoning Officer for
that specific use based on the intended use, the location of such use and the
expected patronage by individuals operating motor vehicles.
      (5)   Floor area defined. For the purposes of applying “floor area,”
floor area shall be the sum of the gross leasable horizontal area of all floors
of a building.
   (b)   Spaces for the handicapped. Parking spaces for handicapped individuals
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Building Code
and Ohio R.C. § 3781.111.
   (c)   Shared parking. Shared or joint use of up to 50% of required parking
spaces may be permitted for two or more uses located on the same parcel or
adjacent parcels provided that the developer can demonstrate to the Zoning
Officer that the uses will not substantially overlap in hours of operation or
in demand for the shared spaces. This shall be guaranteed by a written
agreement from the owner or between the owners involved and all future owners
or assigns which shall be submitted with the required plan. Shared parking
spaces shall be located no more than 300 feet from the uses they are intended
to serve. For shopping centers, parking requirements may be located on
adjoining parcels if the parking requirements for the entire shopping center
are met, the total number of required parking spaces are located within 300
feet from the uses they are intended to serve, and there is a recorded
agreement from the owner or between the owners involved and all future owners
or assigns which shall be submitted with the required plan.
   (d)   Maximum number of parking spaces permitted. In order to prevent
excessive lot coverage, the artificial increase in air temperature, and surface
water runoff, no minimum off-street parking space requirement in §
1294.08, Required Number of Off- Street Parking Spaces. shall be exceeded by
more than 15 percent unless good cause can be shown by the applicant and
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Single-Family Dwellings, Two-Family
Dwellings and accessory apartments are exempt from this provision.

   Figure 1294.04(A)(2)
 
      (2)   Where continuous curbs are used, the paved area of the parking
stall length may be reduced by two and one-half feet, provided that the vehicle
overhang will not encroach on pedestrian circulation or the required setback
for screening and desirable plant growth. Where wheel stops are used, the paved
area of the parking stall length required shall not be reduced. If the wheel
stop or continuous curb is located adjacent to a sidewalk, the sidewalk shall
be constructed to a minimum dimension of five and one- half feet to provide a
clear sidewalk area of not less than three feet for pedestrian access.
   (b)   Access. All parking spaces shall be entered and exited directly from
parking aisles arranged perpendicular to access drives wherever possible.
Parking spaces shall not be permitted along access drives or within thirty feet
of the right-of-way or easement line (and at greater distances as may be
required by the Planning Commission depending on the traffic generation and
parking lot size). Parking spaces shall not be located within eight feet of the
curb or pavement edge of such restricted access drive area. The parking setback
areas along the entry drive, as required in this section, must be a pervious
surface consisting of grass or other landscaping material excluding pavement,
gravel or other rock material.

shall be made, to permit cars to exit the parking lot or garage without backing
onto any street or sidewalk.
      (2)   Back-up area. Each parking space shall be provided with a
sufficient back-up area to permit egress in one maneuver, consisting of one
backward and one forward movement.
   (d)   Surface and drainage. Every off-street parking lot shall be surfaced
with an asphaltic or Portland cement binder pavement providing an all- weather,
durable, and dustless surface. Individual stalls shall be graded to drain so as
to dispose of all surface water within the parking area in accordance with the
subdivision regulations. No surface water from parking areas shall accumulate
or drain over a public sidewalk. Interior landscaped areas may be used for
surface drainage. The use of pervious asphalt or pavers for nonresidential use
is encouraged to prevent surface water runoff. Pervious asphalt or pavers for
nonresidential use shall be approved by the Planning Commission prior to
installation.
   (e)   Lighting. Fixed lighting shall comply with the provisions contained in
§
1294.07 and be so arranged to prevent direct glare of beams onto any public or
private property or street.
   (f)   Wheel stops and continuous curbs. Wheel stops or continuous curbs
shall be provided, located, and designed to protect required screening,
landscaping and pedestrian ways from damage or encroachment of vehicles and to
provide necessary traffic control in the parking area.
      (1)   Wheel stops. Each wheel stop shall be a singular block of
reinforced concrete, stone, or other durable material six inches in height, six
inches in width, and eight feet in length. Wheel stops shall be placed as shown

      (3)   Placement. The wheel stop or continuous curb shall be located a
minimum of four feet from any structures, buildings, walls, or plant material,
excluding ground cover to prevent a vehicle from driving onto the landscape
area or hitting any structure or plant material at the edge of the parking
area. The mature size of the plant material shall be specified to determine if
the landscape meets the setback requirements.

   (b)   Residential parking.
      (1)   On any residential use parcel or residential district, no off-
street parking area, maneuvering area for parking spaces, or loading area shall
be located within any required front yard. This restriction shall not apply to
driveways providing access from the street to the required parking area located

vehicles on such drive serving a detached dwelling. Within ten feet of the
right-of-way, the maximum width of the driveway shall be 24 feet in a Single-
Family District.
      (2)   No residential parking area or garage shall be utilized for more

reproduction value.
   Under such circumstances, all off-street parking shall conform to these
regulations.
   (c)   Boats, trailers, recreational vehicles and mobile home units.
      (1)   No person shall occupy any boat, camping vehicle, mobile home or
trailer on any premises in the Municipality.

no business shall be conducted in such vehicle while it is parked or stored,
and provided, further, that no front or side yard shall be occupied by such
boat, camping vehicle, mobile home or trailer for more than ten calendar days
in one year. If such unit is temporarily parked in the side yard, it shall not
be parked any closer than the required front yard setback or front building
line, whichever is greater.
      (3)   In addition, in any district, the wheels or any similar
transporting devices of any boat, camping vehicle, mobile home or trailer shall

1295.05, Landscaping and Screen Standards.
   (d)   Parking of inoperable or abandoned vehicles. The parking or storage of
inoperable or abandoned vehicles is prohibited outdoors in all districts and as
further provided in this section. The location and duration or temporary
parking or storage of an unlicensed operable vehicle may be approved by the
Zoning Officer through the issuance of a Temporary Zoning Permit on the basis
of the adequacy of the parcel size, condition of the vehicle, visibility from
other properties and absence of undue adverse impact on adjacent property or on
the area as a whole.
   (e)   Commercial vehicles. No commercial motor vehicle exceeding two tons in
rated capacity may be parked in any residential district for longer than 72
consecutive hours unless that commercial vehicle is performing construction or
service work, at which point it shall be removed immediately upon the
completion of work.

less than 20 contiguous parking spaces is expanded and thereby contains 20 or
more contiguous parking spaces, landscaping and screening for the entire
parking area shall be provided and not merely to the extent of its expansion.
      (3)   Maintenance. The duty to provide and maintain landscaping or
screening for all such areas shall be the responsibility of the owner or agent
of public record of the use for which parking lots are required. Landscaped
areas shall be healthy, maintained in good condition and free of all trash,
weeds and other rubbish.
   The Municipality reserves the right to maintain the landscaping or screen if
the owner or his or her agent fails to do so within six months of notification
by the Zoning Officer. The Municipality reserves the right to assess the cost
of maintenance to the property tax bill for the subject property.
   (b)   Total landscaping required. The total landscaping and screening
required for parking lots is 22 square feet per parking and stacking space.
Interior and streetscape landscaping count toward the minimum square feet of
landscaping required per parking space.
   (c)   Screening and interior landscaping standards. Screening and interior
landscaping shall comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Design.
         A.   Interior landscape areas shall be peninsular or island types.
This shall include landscaped parking islands or peninsulas, natural or
landscaped detention basins located in the front or side yards, and the
required streetscape landscaping area.
         B.   Boundary screening areas shall not be counted as landscape areas
for purposes of this section.
         C.   Screening for off-street parking lots shall be required when the
parking lot is located within the front yard in order to soften the visual
impact of the parking lot and parked vehicles. Screening shall follow the
requirements of Sections 1295.05, Landscaping and Screen Standards and 1295.06,
Screening and Buffering Required. With the exception of trees, screening
materials are recommended to be between three and one-half and four and one-
half feet in height.
      (2)   Location. All parking spaces must be at least within 125 feet of a
landscaped area.
      (3)   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area shall be 100 square feet
with a minimum width and length of ten feet.
      (4)   Surface. Any landscape area provided for under this section shall
not contain bare soil. Any ground area shall be covered with stones, mulch,
vegetative ground cover, or other surface permeable by water.
      (5)   Retention basins. Natural or landscaped detention basins may count
toward minimum square footage landscaping requirements when the basins are in
the front or side yards. Retention basins are encouraged to be designed as rain
gardens which naturally filter surface runoff water prior to transmitting it
into the ground. Rain gardens shall follow the general design guidelines
established in the handbook, Rain Garden Guidelines for Southwest Ohio
published by the Ohio State University Extension Office and shall be reviewed
and approved by the Municipal Engineer.

      (6)   Traffic visibility. No landscaping shall obscure visibility at
vehicular intersections with the parking area or other areas where clear
visibility is necessary to assure safe circulation. Where safe visibility is
impaired, canopy trees shall have branches removed from the trunk at least five
feet above the ground and shrubs or ground cover shall not exceed two feet in
height. Evergreen trees and understory trees that would impair visibility for
safe circulation shall not be planted in these areas.
   (d)   Determination of interior landscape requirements. The landscape
requirements shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Interior landscape area requirement. Determine the landscape area
by multiplying the landscape area requirement of 22 sq. ft. per parking and
stacking space by the total number of parking spaces on the lot.
      (2)   Planting requirements. To determine the minimum number of canopy
trees, use the rate of one canopy tree for each ten parking spaces for retail
uses and two canopy trees for each ten parking spaces for non-retail uses. Any
fractional number of trees shall be calculated to the next highest whole
number. To determine the total number of required shrubs, multiply the total
number of required canopy trees by three. One canopy tree may substitute for
three shrubs. Trees and shrubs do not have to be equally spaced, but may be
grouped.
   (e)   Overlap. When any portion of the parcel is subject to more than one
set of landscape or buffer requirements as set forth in this or any other
chapter, the most stringent requirement shall control. The most stringent
requirements shall be defined as those which require the highest fence, wall or
screen or, if no fence, wall or screen is required, the requirements with the
greatest quantity of landscaping.
   (f)   Credit. Existing trees and shrubs, fences, walls or berms on a parcel
may be used to meet the requirements if they meet the standards established in
this chapter and are approved as credit by the Planning Commission.
   (g)   Plant installation and maintenance standards. All new plant material
as part of the requirements for this chapter shall be in accordance with
Chapter 1295 Screening and Landscaping.
   (h)   Modifications. In the event that the unusual topography or elevation
of a development site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the extent of
expansion or redevelopment of the site or parking area is deemed to be
insignificant, or the presence of existing buffers on adjacent developed
property would make strict adherence to the requirements of this chapter serve
no meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and
maintain the required landscaping, the Planning Commission may, upon proper
application by the property owner, and upon making findings of fact, modify the
requirements of this chapter provided the existing or resulting landscape
features of the development site comply with the spirit and intent of this
chapter, Chapter 1295 and other related chapters.
   (i)   Authority. The Planning Commission has the authority to review and
approve any proposed landscape modifications.

§ 1294.07 OUTDOOR LIGHTING FOR OFF- STREET PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.
   The following restrictions shall apply to any outdoor lighting located in
any district or parcels where there are nonresidential off-street parking
spaces.
   (a)   Lighting plan required. A lighting plan is required for any off-street
parking and loading area lighting. The following information shall be
submitted, as a minimum, in order to effectively evaluate the proposed
lighting:
      (1)   Pole height or mounting height of lighting fixture;
      (2)   Type of luminaries;
      (2)   Site coverage;
      (4)   Uniformity including the maximum, average and minimum footcandles;
      (5)   Intensity at property line in footcandles.
   (b)   Height. All outdoor lighting shall be designed, located, and mounted
at heights no greater than 16 feet above grade for non-cutoff lights and 32
feet above grade for cutoff lights. A greater height may be authorized in any
district by a Variance approved pursuant to, Chapter 1254. Cutoff and non-
cutoff lights are illustrated below:

   (c)   Illumination. All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located with
a maximum illumination of 1.0 footcandles as measured at the property line.
   (d)   Shielding. All outdoor lighting for nonresidential uses shall be
located, screened, or shielded so that adjacent lots located in residential
districts are not directly illuminated.
   (e)   Color and glare. No outdoor lighting shall be of such an intensity or
color distortion as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers or
pedestrians.
   (f)   Location. Outdoor lighting need not comply with the yard requirements
of this Code, except that no such light shall obstruct sight triangles as
defined in §
1296.04, Obstructions to Traffic Visibility on Corner Lots.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)

(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1295.05 LANDSCAPING AND SCREEN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Maintenance of landscaping and screening. All landscaping materials
shall be installed and maintained according to accepted nursery industry
procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
property maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a
proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times
and shall remove all noxious, invasive or poison type plants. All unhealthy or
dead plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by the next planting
period, whichever comes first. Violation of these installation and maintenance
provisions shall be grounds for the Building Official to refuse an occupancy
permit, require replacement of the landscape material or institute legal
proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section.
   (b)   Screening establishment. Once a screen has been approved by the
Planning Commission and established by the owner, it may not be used, disturbed
or altered for any purpose that would decrease its effectiveness.
   (c)   Quality and installation. All specifications for the quality and
installation of trees and shrubs shall be in accordance with the most recent
edition of
American Standards for Nursery Stock published by the American Association of
Nurserymen. Trees shall be identified on the approved Street Tree List located
in Appendix F of the Woodlawn Subdivision Regulations. In addition:
      (1)   All plant material shall be free from disease and damage.
      (2)   All plant material shall be planted in a manner that is not
intrusive to utilities, pavement, pedestrian traffic or vehicular traffic.
      (3)   All required plant material shall be planted within one year or by
the next planting season, as outlined in the latest edition of American
Standards for Nursery Stock, after all construction activity in the area of the
new planting has ceased.
   (d)   Size.
      (1)   Canopy trees shall be deciduous trees with a minimum of 12 feet
overall height or a minimum caliper of 2-1/2 inches when installed, and have an
expected height of at least 35 feet at maturity.
      (2)   Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five feet in height when
installed.
      (3)   Understory trees shall be a minimum of five feet in height in clump
form or 1-1/2 inch caliper in single stem form when installed.
      (4)   Shrubs shall be at least 18 inches in height or 24 inches in spread
when installed.
   (e)   Screens. The objective of providing a screen is to visually hide
whatever is behind the screen. The screen shall be 100% opaque. The following
standards for each screening material shall be required.
      (1)   Plant material height requirements. When plant material is used as
screening it shall meet all height requirements in accordance with this
chapter. Height requirements will be considered met when plants are selected
whose height at maturity meet such requirements as certified by a licensed
landscape architect or certified horticulturist.
      (2)   Planting requirements. To be counted towards screening
requirements, evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs shall be planted close
enough to fulfill the objective as defined in this section. Recommended spacing
to achieve this is as follows:
         A.   Spreading evergreen trees should be planted eight feet on center.
Narrow evergreen trees should be planted four feet on center. Designation of
evergreen trees as spreading or narrow shall be certified by a licensed
landscape architect or certified horticulturist.
         B.   Evergreen shrubs should be planted at a maximum of four feet on
center.
      (3)   Combination of materials. Plant material may be used in conjunction
with fences, walls and berms but the overall effect shall be a continuous 100%
opaque screen at maturity. Plants may be planted in rows or be staggered, but
the overall effect shall be a 100% opaque screen.
      (4)   Fences and walls. Natural screening (plantings, berming, etc.) is
preferred, however fences or walls can be used, where appropriate, to create an
effective screen between incompatible uses.
         A.   Fences or walls used to fulfill screening requirements shall be
detailed on the landscaping plan. They are to be of weather-proof materials.
This includes pressure treating, staining or painting of lumber if it is not
redwood or cedar and using aluminum or galvanized hardware. Chain link fences
with or without wooded or synthetic slat material shall not be permitted to
satisfy screening requirements.
         B.   Fences or walls to be used as screens shall be approved by the
Planning Commission during review of the landscape plan and shall be in
conformance with regulations as established in §
1296.24, Fences, Walls and Hedges.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1295.06 SCREENING AND BUFFERING REQUIRED.
   In order to provide protective screening and buffers for residential areas
adjacent to nonresidential areas or for off-street parking lots located in the
front yard or are adjacent to public rights-of-way, the Planning Commission
shall require a wall, fence or greenbelt to be provided by the nonresidential
property owner in accordance with the screening requirements set forth in §
1295.07, Screening Requirements. The Planning Commission shall also use the
following criteria to evaluate proposed screening requirements:
   (a)   Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the
conflict between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and
functional quality of new development.
   (b)   Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions that provide a natural
screening and buffer exist prior to development of properties in question,
every effort shall be made to retain such conditions. In such cases, additional
screening may not be required, provided that provision is made for maintenance
of such areas.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for a wall, fence or
greenbelt if equivalent screening is provided by existing or planned parks,
parkways, recreation areas or by topography or other natural conditions.

   (a)   Purpose. To ensure that landscape materials do not constitute a
driving hazard, a clear sight triangle will be observed at all street and
access drive intersections.
   (b)   Definition. A “clear sight triangle” is the triangular area formed by
a diagonal line connecting two points located on intersecting lines of a right-
of- way, easement of access, or pavement edge of an access drive, each point
being 20 feet from the intersecting lines. See illustration in §
1295.09(d), Restrictions Within Clear Sight Triangles.
   (c)   Design. The entire area of the clear sight triangle should be designed
as illustrated in §
1295.09(d), Restrictions Within Clear Sight Triangles, to provide the driver of
the vehicle entering the intersection with an unobstructed view to all points
nine feet above the roadway along the centerline. The recommended distance
depends upon the design speed of the higher-order street and therefore is
greater for arterial streets than for collectors.
   (d)   Restrictions within clear sight triangles.
      (1)   Within the sight triangle no landscape material with a mature
height greater than 12 inches shall be permitted with the exception of trees
which conform to the following standards. Trees shall be permitted within the
sight triangles as long as, except during early growth stages, only the tree
trunk (no limbs, leaves, etc.) is visible between the ground and nine feet
above the ground, or otherwise does not present a traffic visibility hazard.
Restrictions shall not apply to the following:
         A.   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography,
rise 12 or more inches above the level of the center of the adjacent
intersection;
         B.   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental
signs, and traffic control devices.
      (2)   The restrictions contained in this section shall also apply to any
areas outside the clear sight distance triangle that fall within the sight
distance requirements of the Municipal Engineer.

§ 1295.10 SCREENING FOR SERVICE STRUCTURES.
   Service structures shall include but not be limited to: loading docks,
propane tanks, and dumpsters, electrical transformers, above-ground utility
vaults and other equipment or elements providing service to a building or a
site. The screening height shall be based upon the tallest of the structures
but in no case shall the screening be required to exceed eight feet in height.
   (a)   Location of screening. A continuous planting of evergreen, fence or
wall must enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structure
must be frequently moved or accessed. In such cases, screening may not be
required on the side of the service structure where frequent service is
occurring.
A fully closable gate shall effectively screen the service structure at the
point of service or access.
   (b)   Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any dumpster, trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which
is emptied or removed mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the
placement of the container shall be provided within the screening material. The
curbing shall be at least one foot from the material and shall be designed to
prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or
emptied.

used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious,
noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosion or other hazard; noise or
vibration; smoke; dust; odor or other form of air pollution; heat; cold;
dampness; electrical interference; or other substance, condition or element
(referred to herein as “dangerous or objectionable elements”), in such a manner
or in such an amount as to adversely affect the adjoining premises or
surrounding area, provided that any use permitted or not prohibited by this
Zoning Code may be established and maintained if it conforms to this section at
the point of the determination of its existence.
   (b)   Nonconforming uses. Certain uses established before the effective date
of this Zoning Code and nonconforming as to performance standards, shall be
given a reasonable time in which to conform with this section, as determined by
the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Existing and new uses.
      (1)   Investigation by Zoning Officer. Whenever it is alleged that a use
of land or structure creates or is likely to create or otherwise produce
dangerous and objectionable elements, the Zoning Officer shall make a
preliminary investigation of the matter and shall forward its report, together
with all preliminary findings and evidence, to Planning Commission. If the
Commission concurs in the allegation that dangerous or objectionable elements
exist or are likely to be created, it shall request Council to authorize the
employment of a competent specialist or testing laboratory for the purpose of
determining the nature and extent of such dangerous or objectionable elements
and of practical means of remedying such condition.
      (2)   Determination of existence. The determination of the existence of
any dangerous and objectionable elements shall be made at the location of the
use creating the same and at any points where the existence of such elements
may be more apparent. However, the measurements necessary for enforcement of
performance standards shall be taken, in any “I” District, at the boundary of
such District, or at any point within an adjacent nonindustrial district.
      (3)   Enforcement. Upon receipt of the findings and recommendations of
such specialist or laboratory, the Commission may approve, partially approve or
disapprove the measure recommended therein and instruct the Zoning Officer to
proceed with the enforcement of measures in accordance with Chapter 1254,
Administration and Enforcement.
      (4)   Costs of investigation. The Municipality shall bear the costs of
various tests, consultant fees or other investigations which are required in
this section, provided that the owner of the property under investigation shall
reimburse the Municipality for all such expenses if the operation or use of
such property is found to be in violation of this section by the Commission, or
if contested, by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such reimbursement shall be
made within 30 days from the date of a final Planning Commission ruling or
court judgment.
      (5)   Continued compliance. Any use authorized under this section shall
comply continually herewith and shall remedy any additional dangerous or
objectionable elements which may develop in the course of its operation.
      (6)   The following minimum performance standards shall apply to all uses
in the Municipality:
         A.   Fire and explosion hazards. All activities including storage,
involving flammable or explosive materials, shall include the provision of
adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion. All standards
enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be adhered
to. Burning of waste materials in open fire is prohibited, as enforced by the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
         B.   Air pollution. No emission of air pollutants shall be permitted
which violate the Clean Air Act Amendment, as amended from time to time, as
enforced by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
         C.   Glare and heat. Any operation producing intense light or heat,
such as high temperature processes like combustion, welding or otherwise, shall
be performed within an enclosed building and shall not be visible beyond any
lot line bounding the property whereon the use is conducted.
         D.   Dust and erosion. Dust or silt shall be minimized through
landscaping, paving or other adequate means in a manner as to prevent their
transfer by wind or water to points off of the lot in objectionable quantities.
         E.   Liquid or solid wastes. No discharge at any point into any public
sewer, private sewage disposal system, or stream, or into the ground, of any
materials of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any water supply or
interfere with bacterial processes in sewage treatment shall be permitted. The
standards of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency shall apply.
         F.   Vibrations and noise. No uses shall be located and no equipment
shall be installed in such a way as to produce intense, earth-shaking
vibrations which are discernable without instruments at or beyond the property
lines of the subject premises.
         G.   Odors. No use shall be operated so as to produce the continuous,
frequent, or repetitive emission of odors or odor causing substances in such
concentrations as to be readily perceptible at any point or beyond the lot line
of the property on which the use is located. The applicable standards of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency shall be adhered to.
         H.   Electrical interference. No use shall operate so as to produce an
electrical interference with adjacent properties.
         I.   Light and glare. All areas containing outdoor lighting, including
but not limited to floodlighting, security lighting, canopy or parking lot
lighting shall be regulated as follows:
            1.   Exterior lights shall be fully shielded to prevent the
visibility of the light bulb from adjacent properties. Furthermore, all
external lighting shall be so designed and situated so as not to cause glare on
adjacent properties.
            2.   Compliance shall be achieved by utilizing fixture shielding,
directional control designed into fixtures, fixture location, fixture height,

(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1297.05 STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL FOR CELLULAR OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
ANTENNA AND TOWERS.
   The following standards shall apply to all cellular of wireless
communications antennas and towers. The Municipality may deny application to
construct a new cellular or wireless communications tower if the applicant has
not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
   (a)   Tower placement. The cellular or wireless communications company shall
demonstrate, using the latest technological facts, why the antenna or tower
must be placed in Woodlawn in order to serve its necessary function in the
company's grid system. Part of this demonstration shall include a drawing
showing the boundaries of the area around the proposed location which would
probably also permit the antenna to function properly in the company's grid
system. Said location shall be within the Industrial Park Zoning District.
   (c)   Co-location. If the communications company proposes to build a
cellular or wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna
on an existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that is has contacted
the owners of nearby tall structures within the allowable zone, asked for
permission to install the cellular communications on those structures, and was
denied for either non- economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic
demand was made by the owner, based on prevailing market values. “Tall
structures” shall include, but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers,
buildings over 35 feet in height, antenna support structures or other cellular
or wireless communication towers.
   (c)   Antenna/tower height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower is no higher than necessary to function satisfactorily and to
accommodate the co-location requirements as set out in subsection (b). No
antenna that is taller than the necessary height shall be approved. The maximum
height of the antennae/tower permitted shall be 185 feet.
   (d)   Setbacks from the base of tower. If a new cellular or wireless
communications tower is to be constructed in the Industrial Park Zoning
District, the minimum distance between the base of the tower or any guy wire
anchors and any property line which abuts a zoning district other than a
residential district shall be no closer than the greater of the following:
      (1)   Forty percent of the tower height;
      (2)   The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district; or
      (3)   Fifty feet.
   (e)   Cellular or wireless communications tower safety. All cellular or
wireless communications towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as
approved by the manufactures. Furthermore, the applicant shall demonstrate that
the proposed cellular or wireless communications tower and its antenna are safe
and that the surrounding properties will not be negatively affected by tower
failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio frequency
interference. However, if a specific safety issue in question is determined to
be regulated by either FCC Regulations or applicable Building Code Regulations;
and, the operation or construction is in compliance with such regulations, then
this requirement for safety shall be deemed to have been met.
   Subsequent to the installation of a cellular or wireless communications
tower site, if it is determined by the Municipal Council, upon presentation of
proper and sufficient documentation, and after a public hearing, that the
operation of a cellular or wireless communications tower is inherently
dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or wireless
communication tower shall be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall
cease. The tower or antenna shall also be removed as provided under §
1297.07. However, no order of removal shall be made if it is inconsistent with
existing FCC Regulations.
   (f)   Fencing. A fence shall be required around the cellular or wireless
communications tower and its support structure(s), unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be a minimum of eight feet in
height and shall be erected to prevent access to non-authorized personnel.
   (g)   Landscaping. Landscaping with proper drainage in compliance with a
plan approved by the Building Commission shall be provided to screen as much of
the support structure and equipment shelter ground level features as is
possible. In addition, existing vegetation on or around the site shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible. No exposed dirt shall be permitted.
   (h)   Limiting the number of cellular or wireless communications towers. In
order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the
Municipality in the future, the owner of an existing cellular or wireless
communications tower shall not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other
uses, including other cellular or wireless communications companies, and the
antenna of local police, fire, and ambulance departments. The owner of the
existing cellular or wireless communications tower may request reasonable
compensation for the use of the tower.
   For the purposes of encouraging co-location of cellular or wireless antenna
and other uses, cellular or wireless communication towers shall be designed,
engineered, and constructed as follows: unless waived for good cause to
minimize impact on adjoining property by Building Commissioner. There shall be
no towers 30 feet or more unless there are two or more users.
      (1)   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to support antennas installed by two or more cellular or wireless
communication service users; and
      (2)   Towers more than 75 feet in height but less than 150 feet shall be
designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by three or
more cellular or wireless communication service users; and
      (3)   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by four or more cellular or
wireless communication service users.
   As used in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, the term “users” shall include
the antennas of police, fire, and ambulance departments. In addition, an
applicant must demonstrate that the area acquired by lease or otherwise
acquired for the use and construction of the cellular tower and accessory
structures is sufficient in size to accommodate any additional structures that
may be required if additional users are added to the tower.
   (i)   Licensing. The communications company must demonstrate to the
Municipality that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC). The owner of the tower must also annually provide to the Municipality
prior to January 31 of each year, a list of all users of the tower and each
user shall provide the Municipality with a copy of each users license with the
FCC. No permits will be granted to any applicant unless proof of current FCC
license for the proposed use of the tower is provided.
   (j)   Required parking. If the cellular or wireless communications site is
fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If
the site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall be
equal the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in the Zoning Code.
   (k)   Appearance. Cellular or wireless communications towers under 185 feet
in height shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order
to reduce visual impact. Cellular or wireless communications towers shall meet
all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. No cellular or wireless
communications towers may be artificially lighted except when required by the
FAA. Furthermore, no cellular or wireless communication tower or antenna and
accessory buildings and structures shall contain any signage. All utility lines
serving the towers shall be underground.
   (l)   Site plan required. A full site plan shall be required for all
proposed cellular or wireless communications sites, except antenna to be placed
on existing structures, at a reasonable scale, but not smaller than 1 inch to
50 feet (1"=50'), indicating, as a minimum, the following:
      (1)   The total area of the site.
      (2)   The existing zoning of the property in question and of all adjacent
properties.
      (3)   All public and private right-of-way and easement lines located on
or adjacent to the property which is proposed to be continued, created,
relocated or abandoned.
      (4)   Existing topography with a maximum of two-foot contours intervals.
      (5)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not exceeding two- foot intervals.
      (6)   The locations of all existing buildings and structures and the
proposed location of the cellular or wireless communications tower and all
cellular or wireless communications support structures including dimensions,
height, and where applicable, the gross floor area of the buildings.
      (7)   The locations and dimensions of all curb cuts, driving lanes, off-
street parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, grades,
surfacing materials, drainage plans and illumination of the facility.
      (8)   All existing and proposed sidewalks and open areas on the site.
      (9)   The location of all proposed fences, screening and walls.
         (10)   The location of all existing and proposed streets.
         (11)   All existing and proposed utilities including types and grades.
         (12)   The schedule of any phasing of the project.
         (13)   Documentation which shows all buildings and structures on
adjacent lots and any additional lot which has a lot line within 100 feet of
the lot on which the cellular tower is proposed to be located. The approximate
elevation of the highest point of each building or structure shall be noted.
Applicant may identify any additional features in the area (such as existing
screening, fences and topography) which may be helpful in considering the
impact of the proposed tower on nearby property.
         (14)   Any other information as may be required to determine the
conformance with this Zoning Code. For cellular or wireless communications
antenna to be placed on an existing structure, the applicant shall submit such
information as required by the Zoning Inspector to ensure compliance with the
applicable provisions of this section.
         (15)   Applicant shall maintain and demonstrate adequate liability
insurance on the structure and shall hold harmless the Municipality of Woodlawn
from any and all liability that may arise for the use of the structure.

Commissioner of its intent in writing within 30 days of its cessation of
business, its discontinuance of service, or transfer of ownership.
(Ord. 17-2013, passed 9-24-2013)
§ 1297.07 REMOVAL.
   Any owner of property used as a cellular or wireless communications site
shall provide the Municipality of Woodlawn with a performance bond for the
removal of a cellular or wireless communications tower that has discontinued
use.
   Any cellular or wireless communications tower that has discontinued its
service for a period of 12 continuous months or more is hereby determined to be
a nuisance. A tower declared to be a nuisance must be removed, along with all
accessory structures related thereto. “Discontinued” shall mean that the
structure has not been properly maintained, has been abandoned, become
obsolete, is unused or has ceased the daily activities or operations which had
occurred.
   Whenever, upon inspection it shall appear that a cellular or wireless
communications tower has been abandoned or its use discontinued, the Municipal
Manager or a designated representative shall notify, either by personal
delivery or by certified mail, the owner of the property on which the tower is
located that the tower must be taken down and removed within 90 days. The
Building Commissioner or a designated representative, in addition to any other

§ 1470.01 VACATIONS.
   (a)   The Building Commissioner/Inspector shall be authorized to order any
building or portion of any building vacated, or if it is vacant to remain
vacated for one or more of the reasons set out below:
      (1)   When a building is occupied, or any work, operation or construction
is performed therein or thereon in violation of any of the provisions of the
Ohio Building Code, the Woodlawn Property Maintenance Code, Woodlawn Zoning
Code, or any other applicable provisions in the Village Code of Ordinances.
      (2)   When one or more of the following has occurred:
         A.   The building is unfit for occupancy as it fails to meet the
minimum standards set out by Village ordinances before a certificate of
occupancy can be granted;
         B.   The building is unfit for human habitation because it fails to
meet the minimum standards set out in the Woodlawn Property Maintenance Code
(PMC); or
         C.   The doors, windows, and other openings into the building are
boarded up or otherwise secured by means other than the conventional method
used in the original construction and design of the building.
      (3)   When the owner, agent, or tenant fails or refuses to comply with
any lawful order issued by the Building Commissioner/Inspector.
      (4)   When the building is vacant and unoccupied for the purpose which it
was erected and for which purpose a certificate of occupancy may have been
issued.
      (5)   When it is determined by the Building Commissioner/Inspector and
the Fire Chief that a building constitutes an immediate hazard to the public
health and/or safety.
   (b)   If, after service of any lawful order from the Building Commissioner/
Inspector, the owner, agent, contractor or other person responsible for the
work or violation refuses to comply with such order or does not comply within
the period stated in the order of notice, such failure to comply shall
constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable as provided for in §
1468.99.
(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.02 VACANT BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES DECLARED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Buildings which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of
time become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an
invitation to derelicts, vagrants, and criminals as a temporary abode, and an
increased fire hazard, and the unkept grounds surrounding such property invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish thereon. The use and maintenance of property
in such condition and manner endangers the public health and safety and
constitutes unreasonable use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort, and
repose of a considerable number of the public, is detrimental to the public
good and common welfare and renders a considerable number of the public
insecure in the use and enjoyment of their property, and thus constitutes a
nuisance condition.
(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.03 VACATION NOTICES.
   (a)   Every order of vacation shall be in writing stating the reason for the
order or vacation and directing that the building or portion of the building,
if it is occupied, be vacated by a specified time and shall be served upon the
owner, agent or tenant by personal service, priority mail with delivery
confirmation, or certified mail with return receipt requested. In addition to
providing service to the owner, agent or tenant, the Building Commissioner/
Inspector shall post a notice of vacation in a conspicuous place on the
building. After the posting of such notice or order of vacation, it shall be
unlawful to occupy or permit the occupancy of the premises or any portion
thereof until the provisions of law and the orders issued by the Building
Commissioner/Inspector are complied with.
   (b)   When it shall appear to the Building Commissioner/Inspector that the
reasons for the order of vacation have ceased to exist and that the building or
portion of the building and the occupancy thereof are in substantial compliance
with law, he shall rescind the vacation order in writing.
(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.04 VACATED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR DWELLING UNITS NOT TO BE RENTED.
   When any person, being the owner, agent or having control; of a building,
structure, or dwelling unit, fails to comply with an order of vacation issued
by the Building Commissioner/Inspector and allows the building, structure, or
dwelling unit to be occupied by persons other than himself, such person shall
be in violation of §
1470.03 unless he can show that the property is being occupied without his
knowledge or consent. Proper service of an eviction notice and the good faith
maintenance of forcible entry and detainer proceedings against occupants shall
be prima facie evidence of lack of knowledge and consent. The penalty for
violation shall be as provided in §
1470.99.
(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.05 SECURING OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   If a vacant or vacated building or structure is open to access by
trespassers and/or the elements, the Building Commissioner/Inspector may order
any openings secured to prevent trespassers and/or the elements from entering
such building. The securing of such doors, windows and other openings shall be
maintained as long as the building is vacant or until the windows, doors and
other openings are repaired in an approved manner.
   (b)   If, after service of an order to secure a building or structure, the
owner or agent fails to comply with that order of the Building Commissioner
within the time allowed by that order, or fails to maintain the building or
structure secure from entry, the Building Commissioner/Inspector may at any
time thereafter proceed under §
1470.06 to secure the building and restore the premises to a safe condition.
(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.06 SECURING OF BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER/
INSPECTOR.
   (a) The Building Commissioner/Inspector may secure and barricade any
building whatsoever if:
      (1)   The building or structure has been deemed dangerous and unsafe
pursuant to §

the time provided, but the building has not been determined as threatening to
collapse or posing other immediate peril, pursuant to §
1468.03; or
      (2)   The owner or person responsible has failed to comply with an order
of the Building Commissioner/Inspector to secure the building or structure

1470.06 and for service of notice.
   (e)   The owner or owners shall be billed directly by priority mail with
delivery confirmation certified mail, return receipt requested, or by posting a
copy of the bill upon the building if the Building Commissioner/Inspector is
unable to contact the owner for the cost. The bill for the cost shall be paid
within 30 days after receipt of the bill.
   (f)   If the costs are not recovered, the Building Commissioner/Inspector
shall recover all costs, including administrative and related costs incurred
from the persons liable for such costs by either of the following:
      (1)   The costs shall be certified to the County Auditor, who shall place

provide evidence of the insurance to the Building Commissioner/Inspector.
   (c)   An owner who keeps a property vacant or is subject to §

that:
      (1)   The building is in compliance with the vacated Building Maintenance
standards in §

      (2)   The building is adequately protected from intrusion by trespassers
and from deterioration by the weather.
      (3)   The presence of the building will not be detrimental to the public

(Ord. 23-2014, passed 4-29-2014)
§ 1470.11 FEES.
   (a)   The fee for application for a Vacant Building Maintenance License is
based on the duration of time the building has been ordered vacated or kept
vacated as determined by the following scale:
      (1)   $900.00 for properties that have been ordered vacated or kept
vacant for less than one year;
      (2)   $1,800.00 for properties that have been ordered vacated or kept
vacant for at least one year but less than two years;
      (3)   $2,700.00 annually for properties that have been ordered vacated or
kept vacant for at least two years but less than five years;

§ 1472.01 CERTIFICATE OF RENTAL LICENSE, INSPECTION AND OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   No owner, authorized agent or representative, or person in charge of
any dwelling unit(s) or structure, used or designed or intended to be used as a
single family or multi-family dwelling, up to three units, shall rent or lease
such unit(s) or structure or any part thereof for residential occupancy unless
the owner(s) thereof hold a current and valid certificate of rental license for
each such unit or structure issued by the Code Enforcement Officer. For
purposes of this chapter, a dwelling unit or structure that is subject to a
land sale contract shall be considered a rented or leased dwelling unit or
structure requiring a certificate of rental license.
   (b)   Certificates of rental license shall be valid for a period of one year
from the date of issuance.
   (c)   A certificate of rental license shall be issued after the structure or
unit is inspected by the Code Enforcement Officer. This inspection will enable
the Code Enforcement Officer to identify and list any repairs or other work
necessary to eliminate any unsafe or hazardous conditions, to ensure compliance
with the applicable requirements of the Zoning Code, Fire Code, Property
Maintenance Code, and other Village pertinent ordinances. The owner, occupant,
or authorized representative has the right to be present during such
inspection.
   (d)   Applications for a certificate of rental license shall be made on such
form and in such manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the Code
Enforcement Officer. The application shall include the name(s) of all tenants
who reside in each dwelling unit. The owner or authorized representative shall
notify the Code Enforcement Officer of any change in tenancy for any dwelling
unit or structure that has obtained a certificate of rental license under this
chapter within thirty days of the date the new tenant(s) takes occupancy.
   (e)   If the owner or authorized representative of the unit or structure
does not consent to the proposed inspection, the Code Enforcement Officer, or
his or her designee, may determine that, based upon the condition of the
property, including its age, exterior appearance, lack of complaints, and
rental history, the owner or authorized representative may conduct a self-
inspection of the property by completing and returning a department-issued
inspection checklist. In the event the owner or authorized representative self-
inspects the property, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee, shall
also conduct a plain view exterior inspection of the property. If the Code
Enforcement Officer, or his designee, determines that an inspection is
warranted, based on all facts known to the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or
her designee, at the time, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her
designee, may seek an administrate search warrant to allow an inspection. The
applicationfor the warrant shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is
being sought and shall include a statement that the inspection will be limited
to a determination as to whether there are violations of the provisions of the
applicable Zoning Code, Fire Code, or Property Maintenance Code. The following
factors shall be relevant in determining whether a warrant shall issue:
      (1)   Eyewitness accounts of violation(s);
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;
      (5)   Violations apparent from Village records;
      (6)   Property deterioration;
      (7)   Age of the property;
      (8)   Previous violations on the property.
   (f)   If a warrant is issued, no owner, occupant, or agent thereof shall
fail or neglect, upon presentation of a warrant, to permit entry therein to the
Code Enforcement Officer for the purpose of inspection pursuant to this chapter
and consistent with the terms of the warrant. If the court declines to issue
the warrant, or if no such warrant is sought, the inspection shall be limited
to such areas as are in plain view. A limited-scope inspection conducted
pursuant to this section shall be considered as "inspection" for purposes of
issuing a certificate of rental license.
   (g)   Upon completion of the inspection, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
either certify that the property meets the minimum necessary code requirements,
or shall issue of notice to the owner of violations that must be corrected
prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Rental License. Such notice shall be
provided to the owner or authorized representative within ten days of the
inspection. No certificate of rental license shall be issued until all
violations have been abated.

§ 1472.02 APPLICATION; ISSUANCE; REVOCATION.
   (a)   An application for certificate of rental license shall be made
annually or upon a change in ownership of the unit or structure, whichever
occurs sooner.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the application and payment of the necessary fee, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall cause for an inspection to be conducted as
provided in this chapter.
   (c)   If it is found that the unit or structure is in compliance with all
applicable codes, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a certificate of
rental license for such unit or structure.
   (d)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall have the power to revoke a
certificate of rental license if:
      (1)   Any statement made by the applicant in connection with the issuance
of such certificate is determined to be false;
      (2)   If it is determined that a unit or structure or its use is not in
compliance with the requirements of the Building Code.
(Ord. 12-2017, passed 5-30-2017; Ord. 02-2018, passed 2-28-2018)
§ 1472.03 FEES.
   Applications for a certificate of rental license shall be accompanied by a
nonrefundable fee in the amount of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per structure
or unit, which includes one inspection and one follow-up inspection. Any
additional re-inspections shall require an additional fee of fifty dollars
($50.00). In the event that the application for a certificate of rental license
is required due to a change in ownership which occurs within twelve months of a
previous inspection, the updated license fee shall be reduced to fifty dollars
($50.00).
(Ord. 12-2017, passed 5-30-2017; Ord. 02-2018, passed 2-28-2018)
§ 1472.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, being the owner, agent, or having control of any building or
premises, who violates any provision of this chapter, or fails to conform to
any provision thereof or fails to obey any order of the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her duly authorized agent, shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor of the first degree. However,

than twenty days and not later than one year of the same section of this
chapter shall be charged with a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
