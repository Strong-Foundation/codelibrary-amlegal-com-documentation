HISTORICAL DATA
WHEN FREMONT BECAME A CITY
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The following historical note was discovered in one of the
old city ordinance books. Its author was Basil Meek, attorney, who acted at
various times in the past century as Clerk of Courts of Sandusky County and as
City Postmaster and as a member of the School Board.
   On July 16, 1866, at a meeting of the Village Council, a resolution offered
by Col. Haynes, then a member, was adopted providing for certification to the
Governor, the Auditor and Secretary of State of the fact that Fremont had a
population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, which fact had been established
by a recent enumeration. The Resolution also provided that such State officers
were to be requested to declare the Village a City of the second class.
   On July 23, 1866, at a meeting of the Village Council, a document was
entered in the Journal of the Council in the following words:
   Whereas in accordance with the provisions of the Statutes in such cases made
and provided, satisfactory evidence has been furnished to the undersigned
authorities that the incorporated Village of Fremont, Sandusky County, Ohio,
has a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, and has through its
trustees certified its desire to accept the advancement to the grade of the
City of the Second Class.
   Therefore by virtue of the power conferred upon us by said Statute, we do
declare the incorporated Village of Fremont to have become a city of the Second
Class.
   In testimony whereof we have hereunto affixed our official signatures, and
caused the Great Seal of the State of Ohio, to be affixed at Columbus, this
18th day of July A.D. 1866.
 
   J.D. Cox, Governor,
 
   J.H. Godman, Auditor of State,
 
   Wm. Henry Smith, Sec'y of State.
   On December 17, 1866, at a Council meeting, an ordinance to perfect the
organization of the City with respect to wards and election districts and
dividing the City into wards was introduced by Col. Haynes and passed. The
following division was made:
   First Ward:   All west of the Sandusky River and south of the center line of
Croghan Street.
   Second Ward:   All west of the Sandusky River and north of the center line
of Croghan Street.
   Third Ward:   All east of the Sandusky River.
                                                                                                                
   On April 8, 1867, the first meeting of the Council as the City Council of
Fremont was held. The venerable John Bell was Mayor and it is an interesting
fact that he was the first Mayor of the Village of Lower Sandusky, which was
organized in 1829.
   The members of the First City Council were called Trustees; they were David
Belts and Plate Brush from the First Ward; Ambrose Ochs and T.M. Quilter from
the Second Ward; and J.D. Botefur and Thomas Kelley from the Third Ward. The
Council was organized by the election of J.C. Botefur, President, and Dr. F.
Wilmer, Clerk.
   Thus it appears that Fremont became, in law, a City on April 8, 1867.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   137.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION ADVISORY COMMISSION;
MEMBERSHIP; TERMS; DUTIES.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission.
The Commission shall consist of six residents; two appointed by the Mayor for
an original term of three years, two appointed by Council for an original term
of two years, and two appointed by the Board of Education of the City of
Fremont for an original term of one year. After the original term, all
appointments shall be for terms of three years. Members of the Commission shall
serve without pay. Vacancies in the Commission, occurring other than by
expiration of term, shall be for the unexpired term and shall be filled in the
same manner as original appointments.
   (b)   The Commission members shall elect a President, Vice-President, and a
Secretary who shall service without pay. Election of officers shall be held
annually.
   (c)   The members of the Commission shall meet at least once a month.
   (d)   The purpose of the Commission shall be to gather input from the many
different areas of the community for the purpose of revitalization of our Park
System and on new Recreation Programming and Facilities.
      (1)   The Advisory Commission has no legal powers and can only recommend.
Its function as its name implies, is simply advisory. Its recommendations may
be accepted and implemented or they can be disregarded. It has no power to
enforce its determinations. The Advisory Committee provides municipal
authorities with a community sounding board through the participation of
representative local citizens.
      (2)   Policy developments and implementation in these municipalities
become the responsibility of the Recreation Director with the approval of the
municipal administration. The Advisory Board is valued for its ability to
interpret community needs and desires as well as to interpret official
municipal actions to the various community constituencies represented by
advisory committee members.
      (3)   Citizen input is critical on the Park and Recreational Advisory
Committee, for example, some such citizens have specialized professional
knowledge that is very valuable; others provide general interpretation of
citizen needs and reactions, which is essential to sounding planning. Manpower
for data collection and other elements of the planning process also frequently
depends on the cooperation and support of individual citizens and groups they
represent.
      (4)   Neighborhoods and community committees also form other leisure
services concerns; holiday and special events programs; studies of fees and
charges, concession policies, and related fiscal issues; and facility
development and design. All these require effective citizen involvement in
support of board or commission policy determinations.
         (Ord. 95-2907. Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.02  SPECIAL RECREATION TRUST FUND.
   There is hereby established a Special Recreation Trust Fund, and there shall
be paid into the Fund all donations received by the City of Fremont. The Fund
shall be held in trust by the City and used for any lawful purpose. The Fund is
created under the authority of Ohio R.C. 5705.09(H).
(Ord. 95-2907. Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.03  EXPENDITURE OF TRUST FUND MONIES.
   Funds in the Special Recreation Trust Fund are to be expended on
authorization of the Mayor and the City Auditor is authorized to draw his
warrants on the City Treasurer for payments therefrom upon receiving proper
certificates and vouchers therefor approved by the Mayor or officers authorized
by law to approve the same. (Ord. 95-2907. Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.04 INSTRUCTIONAL CONTRACTS.
   The City may contract with independent contractors to provide self-
supporting instructional courses for members of the public on property under
the jurisdiction of the City. Such contracts shall fix the fee to be paid by
participants, the fee of the instructor and may authorize the instructor to
receive the fees, retain his portion thereof and pay the balance into the
Public Recreation Fund together with an accounting, in a form approved by the
City Auditor.
(Ord. 95-2907. Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION FINANCIAL BOARD.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Parks and Recreation Financial Board, which
shall review and establish fees and charges for all Parks and Recreation
Department memberships, programs, rentals and services and report the same to
the City Council.
   (b)   The Parks and Recreation Financial Board shall consist of the
following members: Mayor, Safety-Service Director, City Auditor, Parks and
Recreation Director, and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission
Chairperson.
   (c)   That the Mayor shall serve as the Chair of the Parks and Recreation
Financial Board, which shall meet at least once each year and as otherwise
determined by the Mayor.

   (a)   On or before April 15th of each year, every resident subject to the
provisions of Section
171.03 shall, except as hereinafter provided, make and file with the Tax
Administrator, a Municipal tax return on a form prescribed by and acceptable to
the Tax Administrator, whether or not a tax is due. When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the end of such fiscal year or period. The Tax Administrator is
hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said employer or
employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other
taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax
Administrator may be accepted as the return of a nonresident employee whose
sold income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such qualifying wages,
commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
   (b)   Joint filing is permitted.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator; or on
a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality’s prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession,
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.

if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal income tax
return does not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of
the tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the
period of extension at the rate set out by Section
171.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due.
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
171.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.11 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
171.11. The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the

(Ord. 2004-3353. Passed 11-18-04.)
   171.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate provided in Section
171.03 hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such
taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   Payment of taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality during
the measurement period are to be made quarterly on or before the last day of
the month following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator may require monthly filing and payments
whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe it is in the best interest
of the Municipality to do so. Notice of a change in filing and payment
requirements shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must
begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (g)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
171.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (j)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 2003-3303. Passed 12-4-03.)

shall be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth, and thirteenth
months after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (5)   The mere submission of a declaration estimating a tax liability
shall not constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.

(1/2%) per year for the years July 1, 1956 through December 31, 1963, one
percent (1%) per year for the period January 1, 1964 through March 31, 1988,

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this chapter:

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal

for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

172.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
172.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

individual's annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a
credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
 172.04 of this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation. Nothing in this division
prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under this division after
properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 172.04 of this chapter.
         (Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15; Ord. 2023-4190. Passed 11-2-23.)
   172.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Municipality. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
172.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
172.01 of this chapter, of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%). An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
    
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator such that the payment is postmarked not later than 15 days after
the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
such that the payment is postmarked not later than the last day of the month
following the last day of each calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
            (Ord. 2017-3874. Passed 12-7-17.)
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Municipality
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
   (C)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
         (d)    "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services
in a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.

events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Municipality income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Municipality if the employee performed such services in the Municipality
on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
172.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order
to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property
that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Municipality under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
172.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.04.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Municipal income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
172.04 of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Municipality.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Municipality
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality. No remittance is required if the
net amount is due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates.An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's the Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
172.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
172.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter and of the Municipality's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Municipality's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period. (Ord. 2018-3888. Passed 3-15-18.)
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
172.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to
the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Municipality
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
172.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   172.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject
to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed one hundred
percent (100%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such other Municipality or
the tax rate imposed under this chapter.
   (B)    The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Municipality's income tax
for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Municipality for
the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled,
and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit

withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

provided in this section.
         (Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of

         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax

3874. Passed 12-7-17.)
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05 of the ORC.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
172.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Municipality under Section
172.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
172.18 (A)(4).

have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by the
Municipality. If the Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the

municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality's tax rate. However, if the Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
172.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of
Section
172.11 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
172.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipality's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Municipality tax return showing
income subject to the Municipality income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional Municipality income tax shown due thereon or a claim for refund of
any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.

   172.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
172.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
172.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
172.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
172.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.13 AUDITS. 
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipality's income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. 
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Municipality ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.18 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)    As used in this section:

accordance with division (A)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,

         (a)    Any return required to be filed under applicable law for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Municipality on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be
made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

   172.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

      (6)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
172.03;
      (7)   (a)    Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made;
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
172.04.
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
172.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
172.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
172.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 for a violation of Section
172.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 2015-3785. Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.20 REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the
Municipality shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that
a member may serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority.
The board member appointed by the administrative official of the Municipality
shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine

   Whenever the Safety-Service Director, upon recommendation of the City
Engineer and upon consideration of all other information, determines that the
particular conditions of a public alley result in the likelihood that motorists
will frequently violate the normal speed limit and are not likely to be readily
apprehended, and provided that he further finds that it is necessary in the
interest of safety to reduce the speed limit to ten miles per hour and to erect
pavement rises to discourage speeding, he shall have the authority to construct
pavement rises in such alley at such location or locations to effectively
discourage excessive speeding, provided the pavement rises are identified with
yellow markings and are constructed to permit the safe passage of a motor
vehicle at the speed of ten miles per hour, and provided suitable signs are
posted to indicate the existence of the pavement rises and the speed limit of
ten miles per hour. It shall thereafter be prima-facie unlawful to operate a
motor vehicle at a speed exceeding ten miles per hour in such alley, and such
reduced limit shall supersede that of alleys generally.

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH HIGHWAYS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or highway traffic signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and no highway
traffic signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under the Director’s jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs
or removes a stop sign under this paragraph, the Director shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or highway
traffic signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices.
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no highway traffic signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.
Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a
vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on
the through highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or highway traffic
signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through highways, or may
designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection and shall erect like
signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.

      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official highway traffic signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

indication is located is about to be closed to vehicle traffic in that
direction and will be followed by a steady red “X” signal indication, either
within the same signal face or in a downstream signal face.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow means that the lane over
which the signal indication is located is open to traffic making a left turn
from either direction of travel, but not for through travel.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow means that the lane over
which the signal indication is located is open to traffic making a left turn in
that direction, without opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through
travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X” means that the lane over which the signal
indication is located is closed to vehicle traffic in the direction viewed by
the road user.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
 303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court
shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of
thirty consecutive days. The court shall impose the thirty-day mandatory jail
term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this
section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4503.231.
      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the
vehicle as determined by publications of the national auto dealers association.

that results in the death of another or the unlawful termination of another’s
pregnancy may result in the person being guilty of aggravated vehicular
homicide under Ohio R.C. 2903.06. The court may warn the person of the
applicable penalties for that violation under Ohio R.C. 2903.06 and 2929.142.
      (9)   As used in subsection (h) of this section, “electronic monitoring”,

same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.
   (i)   Vehicle Operation After Underage Alcohol Consumption Penalty. Whoever
violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle after

the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the offender’s

the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if
the offense could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the
court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall
order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult
probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on
behalf of the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   921.04 SERVICE OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS; RATES.
   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated outside the City
and having any connection with the City's sewerage system or otherwise
discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly
or indirectly, into the City's sewerage system, the charge shall be based upon
the quantity of water used thereon or therein as the same is measured by a
water meter or meters there in use, as hereinafter described, and there shall
be charged the rates set out in Section
921.03 plus thirty percent (30%).
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.05 WATER METERS FOR SOURCES OTHER THAN CITY WATER.
   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharging sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into
the City's sanitary sewerage system obtains part or all of the water used from
other sources than the City water works, which is not measured by a water meter
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the Safety-Service Director
then, in each such case, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or
their expense, install and maintain water meters satisfactory to the Director
on all supplies other than City water and the quantity of water used to
determine the sewerage charge shall be the sum of the quantities of water
measured by all meters.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.06  WATER NOT ENTERING SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharges sanitary
sewerage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City's sanitary
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in the excess of
the amount allowed for a minimum bill per month or quarter year, and it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the Safety-Service Director that a portion of
water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the
sanitary sewerage system, then the Director may determine in such a manner and
by such methods as he may find practicable the percentage of metered water
entering the sanitary sewerage system or he may require or permit the
installation of additional meters in such a manner as to determine the quantity
of water actually entering the sanitary sewerage system. The sewerage charge
shall be based upon the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system
subject to the minimum charge provisions set up in Section
 921.03 and
921.04.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.07 INDUSTRIAL WASTES; SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: This section was repealed by Ordinance 79-2028 passed
October 18, 1979. See Chapter
922 for relevant provisions.)
   921.08 INDUSTRIAL WASTES; RATES.
   (a)   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises having or proposing
to have any connection with the City sanitary sewerage system or otherwise
proposing to discharge industrial wastes, either directly or indirectly, into
the City sanitary sewerage system, a written permit must first be duly issued
by the Safety Service Director. Such written permit shall be granted after a
determination is made that no injurious acids, alkalies, toxic substances, oils
and greases, ammonia or dissolved gases are contained in the wastes which may
injure the sanitary sewerage system, its appurtenances or parts thereof, or may
hinder the treatment and purification of sewage. Where the industrial wastes
contain such injurious materials or have a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in
excess of 200 milligrams per liter or suspended solids (SS) in excess of 325
milligrams per liter, as determined by an analysis of composite samples,
satisfactory pretreatment may be required. Where industrial wastes contain BOD
in excess of 200 milligrams per liter and SS in excess of 325 milligrams per
liter, a surcharge shall be levied using the following formula:
   Surcharge ($/month) = ($7.93 x lbs BOD) + ($10.56 x lbs SS)
   The determination of pounds shall be calculated in the following manner:
      Average Monthly Flow in MGD x 8.34 x monthly flow weighted average BOD
(mg/l) = lbs of BOD
      Average Monthly Flow in MGD x 8.34 x monthly flow weighted average SS
(mg/l) = lbs of SS
Where:
   MGD = millions gallons per day
   Mg/l = miligrams per liter
   lbs. = pounds
   The rates charged per pound of BOD and per pound of SS used in the surcharge
formula listed above shall increase or decrease by a percentage equal to the
change of rates charged to customers for over 12,200 cubic feet per month
listed in Section
921.03.
(Ord. 2024-4202. Passed 3-21-24.)
   921.09 PAYMENT OF CHARGES.
   The sewerage charges provided in this chapter shall be payable monthly or
quarterly at the office of the City Department of Water and may be made payable
at the same time as water bills are payable in the district in which the lot,
parcel of land or premises is located. The due date shall be that specified on
the statement for the sewerage service charge presented to the user of the
sewerage system.
   The average service charge as provided for in this chapter shall be payable
in four quarterly or twelve monthly payments in each year, as provided in
Sections
921.03 and
921.04.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-46.)
   921.10 NONPAYMENT; CITY'S REMEDY.
   Each sewerage service charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter is hereby
made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection
to the sanitary sewerage system of the City and if the same is not paid within
thirty days after it is due and payable, it shall be certified to the Auditor
of Sandusky County who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the County
with the interest and penalties allowed by law to be collected as other taxes
are collected.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.11  COLLECTION OF CHARGES; REGULATIONS.
   The sewerage service charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter shall be
collected by the City Department of Water and the Safety-Service Director shall
make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be deemed necessary for
the safe, economical and efficient management and protection of the City
sewerage system, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections
to the sewerage system and for the regulation, collection, rebating and
refunding of such charges.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.12  SEWER FUND; PURPOSE.
   The funds received from the collection of such sewerage service charges as
hereinbefore authorized shall be deposited daily with the City Treasurer and
shall be deposited in an account known as the "Sewer Fund". When appropriated
by Council, such moneys shall be available for the payment of the cost and
expense of the operation, maintenance, management and repair of the sanitary
sewerage system, and any surplus in the Fund may be used for the enlargement or
replacement of the same, for the payment of the interest on any incurred debt
for the construction of such sewerage system and for the creation of a sinking
fund for the payment of such debt, but shall not be used for the extension of
sewers to serve unsewered areas or for any other purpose whatsoever.
(Ord. 952. Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.13  SEWAGE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   The Safety-Service Director, subject to the approval of Council, shall and
is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the County, with cities and
villages and with corporations and individuals whose premises are located
outside the City and who desire to discharge sewage, industrial wastes, water
or other liquids into the City's sewerage system, which agreements shall fix
the terms and conditions under which such sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids may be discharged into the sewerage system. All funds received in
connection with such agreements shall be deposited and expended in conformity
with Section
921.12.

the City Engineer.
   (b)   Anyone desiring a sewer within the City streets shall construct the
sewer from the source to the furtherest end of the property to be served at the
expense of the person requesting such sewer. The sewer so constructed shall
become the property of the City upon its completion and acceptance of the City
Engineer.
   (c)   In the event that the City determines that a larger sewer line should
be constructed than the one requested then upon construction of the larger
sewer line the City shall assume an additional expense of the material for such
sewer only and so much of such expense that exceeds the size of the sewer
necessary and adequate to serve the property for which such sewer service is
requested.
(Ord. 1271. Passed 12-17-70.)
   921.16 RESIDENT SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS AND TAP-IN CHARGES.

   For any use not shown herein, the number of units shall be determined by the
City Engineer on the basis of accepted engineering practice on the basis of
anticipated flow from applicant when compared to a single-family residence
where the flow of 400 gallons per residence per day will be considered as a
unit of one.
   The tap-ins charge will be calculated in accordance with this schedule by
multiplying the benefitted number of units by the rate for a unit of one.
   (d)   Where connection is made directly into a trunk or interceptor sewer,
and where the property to be connected has not been assessed for at least the
equivalent cost of construction on eight inch lateral sewer to serve such
property, the charge as prescribed by subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall be
increased by an amount equal to the frontage of the parcel of land for which

within a street right of way, the charges as prescribed by subsections (b), (c)
and (d) hereof shall be increased by one hundred dollars ($100.00) to defray
the cost of restoring the City street to its original condition.
   (f)   Charges for connections made outside the boundaries of the City and
not subject to any separate agreements (County Sewer District No. 1) shall be
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable charge for a connection made

   (g)   The initial tap-in charge as set forth in the preceding subsections
shall be increased by an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the initial charge
on January 1, 1975, and on January 1 of each year thereafter until January 1,
1998, and such charges as so increased shall remain in effect and by the tap-in
charges applicable during the calendar year in which the tap-in permit is
obtained. Such incremental charges are designed to offset the interest costs
involved by the City in constructing such sewers.
   (h)   The permits and charges provided for in this section shall not be
deemed to preclude the subsequent levy of assessments against benefitted
properties to provide funds for the construction of sanitary sewers required to
provide local sewer service to such properties, and the permit and charges
provided for by this section shall be in addition to any other permits and
charges required by any other legislation and regulations of the City.
   (i)   In the event that the Safety-Service Director shall ascertain that any
property has been connected directly or indirectly to the municipal sewerage

charge as calculated in accordance with the applicable subsection (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f) and (g) hereof in installments the Engineer shall calculate the
installment payment by adding fifteen percent (15%) to the total tap-in charge
to offset interest charges and the total so calculated divided then by sixty,
this amount then so determined shall be the monthly installment payable over
sixty installments. The Engineer shall so certify the monthly installment
amount to the Safety-Service Director to be billed and collected in the same
manner as sanitary sewer charges are billed and collected as provided for in
this chapter.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 2-21-74.)
   921.17 NONRESIDENT TAP-INS.
   (a)   Persons owning property immediately adjacent to the corporate limits
of the City, who are desirous of tapping into the City sewer immediately
available to their property shall make application for permission to tap into
the sewer to Council for its consideration.
   (b)   The application shall state the name of the property owner, give a
description of the property and buildings thereon to be served and promise and
covenant that if the permit is issued the privilege shall not be extended to
include other houses or buildings on such property described in the application
and that the applicant will pay all costs of constructing the sewer. The
applicant shall be sworn to and subscribed before a notary public as being true
in every respect.
   (c)   Council, after duly considering the application, shall refer the same
to the City Engineer and Safety-Service Director for information as to the size

   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted
stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to the
sewage system. Any existing roof drain connections carrying unpolluted
stormwater to the sewage system shall be disconnected above ground in a manner
approved by the Engineer.
(Ord. 90-2655. Passed 7-5-90.)
   922.03 SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   The following described substances, material, waters or wastes shall
be limited to discharge to the City's sewage system to concentrations or
quantities which will not cause interference or harm to either the sewers,
sewage treatment process or equipment; will not have an adverse effect after
treatment on the receiving stream; will not cause violations of the NPDES
permit, requirements or regulations; or will not endanger the public's lives or
property or constitute a nuisance. The Director may set limitations more severe
than the following if such limitations are necessary to meet the above
objectives. These local limits may be found in the Fremont Local Limits
Document, the most recent technologically based local limits evaluation as
approved by the Ohio EPA. In setting these limitations to the acceptability,
the Director will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject
wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials or
construction of sewers, the wastewater treatment processes employed, the
capacity of the Water Pollution Control Center and its sludge recycling
program, the degree of treatability of the wastes, and other pertinent factors,
including cost effectiveness.
      (1)   When limits in a Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms
in mass pollutant per limit of production, the Director may convert the limits
to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutants discharged per
day or effluent concentrations for purpose of calculating effluent limitations
applicable to individual Industrial Users (IU).
      (2)   Any IU operating under a Wastewater Contribution Permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production based standard shall notify the Director within two business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Failure to adequately
notify the Director will require the IU to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its Wastewater Contribution Permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
         
   (b)   The limitations included in this chapter or restrictions of materials
or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sewage system which
will not be violated without the approval of the Director are as follows:
      (1)   Industrial wastes containing floatable oil, fat or grease.
      (2)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
       (4)   Any wastewater which, by interaction with other water or wastes in
sewage system releases obnoxious gases, forms suspended solids which interfere
with the sewage system, or creates a condition injurious to structures and
treatment processes. The Director shall require all discharges to conform to
all NPDES permit requirements and any other applicable State or Federal
requirements.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes that create a hazard to humans or animals or
creates any hazard in the receiving waters of the Water Pollution Control
Center, or directly causes the City of Fremont to violate its NPDES permit.
   While direct limits for these wastes are usually included in a Wastewater
Contribution Permit, those users that are not required to have a Wastewater
Contribution Permit or that do not have a specific limit listed in the
Wastewater Contribution Permit shall not exceed background concentrations of
these wastes.
   These concentrations may be changed as necessary pursuant to applicable
promulgated limiting concentrations established by State or Federal agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-lives or
concentrations to exceed State or Federal regulations.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute "slug"
as defined in Section
922.01(a)(30).
   (c)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitations developed by the City or State.
   (d)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility. All affected existing users shall complete such a
plan within 180 days after the effective date of this chapter. Review and
approval of such plans and procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, the user
will be required to immediately notify the Director of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration,
volume and correction.
      (1)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
sewage system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by its chapter or other applicable law.
 
   (e)   In the event that an industrial user experiences an "upset" that
causes a discharge of prohibited or limited materials regulated by this
chapter, the user shall notify the Director, the police, and the Fremont WPCC
immediately. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of wastes, concentration, volume and corrective action. Within five days
following the "upset" discharge the user shall submit to the Director a
detailed written report, including the following facts:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the IU can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The IU has submitted the following information to the Fremont WPCC
within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset;
         A.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance.
         B.   The period of non-compliance including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue.
         C.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (f)   The Industrial User seeking to establish the affirmative defense of an
"upset" shall have the burden of proof.
   (g)   The Industrial User shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (h)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described water or wastes into the sewage system:
      (1)   Any gasoline benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosives liquids, solids or gas or pollutants which create fire or explosion
hazard in the sewer system including but not limited to, wastestreams with a
closed cup flash point of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees
Centigrade using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (2)   Any water containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any waste treatment processes, result in toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a hazard in
the receiving water's of the Water Pollution Control Center.
      (3)   Any water or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 10.0
or as otherwise required. For Industrial User (IU's) utilizing continuous pH
monitoring, the total time during which the pH values are outside the required
range of pH values shall not exceed one hour maximum on any day, and the total
time during which the pH values are outside the required range of pH values
shall not exeed 7 hours and 26 minutes in any calendar month.
      (4)   Solid viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction of flow in sewers or other interferences with the process
operation of the sewage system.
       (5)   No person shall access the sewer system or the Water Pollution
Control Center for any activity including discharge of hauled septic or
industrial waste except at locations and at times as designated by the Director
with the Director's approval. Any removal of manhole lids, or other access to
the sewer system for the purpose of discharging wastes at times and/or location
other than those designated by the Director, or without the expressed
permission of the Director, shall be considered a violation and shall be
subject to the remedies specified in Section
922.04 and/or Section
 922.99.
      (6)   Any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that cause pass through or interference or of
concentrations of 50 mg/l, whichever is less, to be determined by approved
solvent extraction methods as prescribed in the most recent revision of 40 CFR
136.
   (i)   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure or equipment which is
part of the sewage system.
   (j)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited and the Director may initiate enforcement
activities against an IU for a bypass unless:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life; personal injury
or severe property damage or;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance and;
         C.   The IU submitted notices as required.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
         A.   If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass.
         B.   An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Director and
Fremont WPCC within twenty-four hours from the time the IU becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission must be provided within five days from the time
the IU becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass, its cause, its duration, including exact times and
dates, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report is received within twenty-four hours.
       (3)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the
conditions listed in
922.03(j)(2).
   (k)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
(Ord. 09-3485. Passed 2-19-09.)
   922.04 REMEDIAL OPTIONS OF DIRECTOR; ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS AND ORDERS.
   (a)   If any wastewater discharged or proposed to be discharged into the
sewage system contains the substances or characteristics herein described, the
Director may:
      (1)   Suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or Wastewater
Contribution Permit when such suspension is necessary, in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, causes interference to the
Water Pollution Control Center or its sludge program or causes the City to
violate its NPDES permit. Any person or Significant Industrial User (SIU)
notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the
Wastewater Contribution Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of failure of the person or SIU to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed
necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or
minimize damage to the sewage system or endangerment to any individuals. The
City shall reinstate the Wastewater Contribution Permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A
detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence
shall be submitted to the City within fifteen days of the date of occurrence;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition or acceptable
amount of contaminant before discharge into the sewage system;
      (3)   Require payment to cover added costs of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing charges;

corporation, or organization.

corporation, or organization after such park or facility is named.

individual, corporation, or organization.

the rights of way of two (2) streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a
curve with a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet joining the two (2) sidelines
of such rights of way.
   (e)    Setback Line.
      (1)    On secondary and minor streets. The minimum setback line shall be
twenty-five (25) feet measured from the property line, and shall be required in
all subdivisions unless larger setbacks are required by zoning ordinances, plat
restrictions or other existing covenants or laws.
      (2)    On major thoroughfares. The minimum setback line shall be thirty-
five (35) feet on all major thoroughfares.
   (f)    Lots Using Septic Tanks. Lots presently served with septic tanks may

regulations of the Sandusky County Public Health Department or until such lots
are accessible to a sewer, at which time such septic tank use shall terminate
and connection shall be made to the sewer.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1115.05 COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL SITES.
   These subdivision regulations may be modified by the City Planning
Commission for subdivisions that are proposed for commercial or industrial use.
Such modifications shall be made and required by the Planning Commission as
will assure lot sizes and shapes, landscaping or buffering, sign age, lighting,
street standards and arrangements, and off-street parking and loading areas
that are carefully designed to serve the industrial or commercial land uses
which are proposed or permitted.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1115.06 LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENTS.
   Large-scale developments, planned unit developments, multi-use and variable
density or cluster developments not otherwise anticipated by these rules and
regulations, shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission for
consideration. The City Planning Commission shall review such developments to
ensure the adequacy of public open spaces and improvements, traffic
circulation, recreation, education, light, air and the overall needs of the
tract when fully developed and populated. The Planning Commission shall
ascertain that the proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
development; that it will be in harmony with development in adjoining areas;
and that such covenants, restrictions, financial guarantees and other legal
assurances to guarantee the plan will be followed and fully achieved.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1115.07 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)    Procedure for Allocating Open Space. The allocation of areas for
parks, playgrounds, school sites and other public open spaces shall be by one
(1) of the following methods:
      (1)    Dedication to the City;
      (2)    Reservation of land for use of property owners by deed or
covenants.
   (b)    Conformance with the City Open Space Plan. Conformance with the City
plan for parks and other open public grounds shall be required where a
designated site shown on the City plan is located in whole or in part within a
proposed subdivision. The Planning Commission may request the subdivider to
dedicate or reserve such area which lies within the subdivision, provided that
the amount of land to be dedicated for park purposes shall not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total area of the subdivision.
   (c)    Large-scale Developments. For large-scale developments, the Planning
Commission may request the subdivider to dedicate or reserve sites for
playgrounds and parks whose character, extent and location will be suitable to
the needs created by such development, whether or not such sites are shown on
the City open space plan. Such areas shall be in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, of reasonable size for the particular use. In general, the
subdivider shall be required to set aside ten percent (10%) of the gross area
of the subdivision for this purpose.
   
   (d)    Money Payments. In lieu of a provision of land for parks and
playgrounds, particularly where such public land will be too small for use, the
Planning Commission may request payment of money to the City. This payment must
be not more than ten percent (10%) of the market value of the entire tract
prior to subdivision and cannot be used by the City except to create, improve,
expand or maintain public recreational uses serving the neighborhood created by
or including the subdivision.
   (e)    Surface Water Areas.
      (1)    Easement along streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide a permanent easement dedicated to the proper authority for the
purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream
for drainage or public use.
      (2)    Flooding and poor drainage. The right is reserved to disapprove
any subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains
extremely poor drainage facilities. However, if the subdivider agrees to make
such improvements as will make the area completely safe for residential
occupancy, the subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval
of the City Planning Commission, the Sandusky County Public Health Department,
and the City Engineer.
   (f)    Preservation of Outstanding Features. The preservation of outstanding
features such as scenic spots, historic sites, watercourses or exceptionally
fine groves of trees shall be shown due regard. Dedication to and acceptance by
a public agency is usually the best means of assuring their preservation.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1115.08 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
subdivision design standards of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the City
Engineer for recommendations as to possible variances.

   1123.02 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   (a)    R-1 Single-Family Residential District. The purpose of the R-
1 District is to provide an area for medium to low density, residential
development. The only permitted residential use shall be single-family.
   (b)   R-2 Mixed Residential District. The purpose of the R-2 District is to
permit a variety of residential development in areas that can accommodate them
without disturbing the character of the surrounding neighborhoods. Residential
uses permitted in the R-2 District include one- and two-family dwellings.
Three-family dwellings may be permitted if a valid conditional use permit is
obtained.
   (c)    R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District. The purpose of the R-
3 District is to provide areas for the introduction of multiple-family
residential development including apartment buildings, condominiums,
manufactured home parks and other similar developments.

to provide increased flexibility to those areas that are intermediate between
commercial and residential areas.
   (e)    B-1 CBD Central Business District. The purpose of the B-1 Central
Business District is to encourage the viability of the commercial core of the
City of Fremont. By locating more intensive commercial uses in close proximity
to each other, each use will support and benefit the others.
   (f)    B-2 General Commercial District. The purpose of the B-2 District is
to accommodate extensive commercial uses that require large lots, usually for
display and/or outdoor storage purposes, and highway oriented businesses that
require highway or thoroughfare frontage for visibility and ready accessibility
for their customers who come from a sizeable trade area extending well beyond
the City of Fremont.
   (g)    I-1 Wholesaling and Light Industry District. The purpose of the I-
1 District is to allow for wholesale operations and limited nuisance industry.
   (h)    I-2 General Industrial District. The purpose of the I-2 District is
to reflect the existing pattern of industrial establishments in the community,
to allow for their future expansion and to delineate additional industrial land
for new industry. The intent is to designate those lands that have the best
industrial development potential by virtue of good access to the state highway
network and/or railroad right of way, that are capable of being fully served by
all necessary utilities, and are somewhat removed from adjacent residential
development and housing.
   (i)    C Conservancy District. The purpose of the C Conservancy District is
to preserve areas of open space. In some cases, construction shall be
restricted so as to protect lands necessary to convey floodwaters.
   (j)    IC Institutional Campus District. The purpose of the IC,
Institutional Campus District is to accommodate large institutional uses in
campus-like settings, such as hospitals, schools and colleges. The IC District
is intended to promote and enhance the development and expansion of medical,
educational and other large institutional uses while minimizing the adverse
impacts that can result when such uses are located near residential
neighborhoods.

imaginative site planning that provides both a variety of dwelling types and
lot sizes and usable common open space as an integral part of the development.
   (b)   Downtown Historic District (DHD).  The purpose of the Downtown
Historical District is to provide for the restoration and preservation of the

(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1129.03 ANIMALS.
   (a)    Intent. The regulations of this Section are established to permit the
keeping of farm animals in a manner that prevents nuisances to occupants of
nearby properties and prevents conditions that are unsanitary or unsafe.
   (b)    Agricultural livestock.
      (1)    Agricultural livestock, except as provided in Subsection (b)(2),
(d) and (e) below, shall not be permitted in any zoning district.
      (2)    In a residential district, horses may be kept if the total lot
area exceeds five (5) acres, provided that no structure, pen or corral for such
use shall be within 100 feet of any lot line, and a conditional use permit is
obtained from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)    Dogs and Cats. Any lot, building, structure, enclosure or premises
wherein four (4) or more dogs or four (4) or more cats, four (4) months of age
or older, are maintained shall be construed to be a kennel and shall not be
permitted in any residential district.
   (d)    Chickens, Ducks, Rabbits and Similar Animals. The keeping of
chickens, ducks, rabbits and similar farm animals, and cages, coops, and
enclosures for the keeping of such animals, shall be governed by the following
regulations:
      (1)    Number. No more than one (1) such animal shall be kept on a parcel
of land for each eight hundred (800) square feet of parcel or lot area. For a
residential lot of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) square feet, this
regulation would permit no more than a total of six (6) such animals.
      (2)    Setbacks. The coops or cages housing such animals may not be
located in front yard or side yard areas and shall not be located within ten
(10) feet, of a side yard line or of a rear yard line. No animals shall be kept
in required front yard or side street yard areas.
      (3)    Prohibitions. No roosters, geese or turkeys may be kept in a
residential district except on a parcel that is at least one (1) acre in area
and only if the coop or cage housing the bird(s) is at least one hundred (100)
feet from all property lines. For parcels greater than one (1) acre in area,
one (1) additional such bird may be kept for each 24,000 square feet in excess
of one (1) acre. No predatory birds may be kept on any property under the
regulations of this Section.
   (e)    Bee Keeping. The keeping of bees, and associated beehives, shall be
governed by the following regulations.
      (1)    Number.
         A.    In residential districts no more than one (1) beehive shall be
kept for each 2,400 square feet of lot area, and no beehive shall be kept on a
lot less than 2,400 square feet in area.
         B.    In non-residential districts the number of beehives shall be
limited to one (1) for each 1,000 square feet of lot area.
      (2)    Location and Setbacks. No beehive shall be kept closer than ten
(10) feet to any lot line and ten (10) feet to a dwelling or the permitted
placement of a dwelling on another parcel, and no beehive shall be kept in a
required front yard or side yard. The front of any beehive shall face away from
the property line of the Residential property closest to the beehive.
      (3)    Fences and Shrubs. A solid fence or dense hedge, known as a
“flyway barrier” at least six (6) feet in height, shall be placed along the
side of the beehive that contains the entrance to the hive, and shall be
located within five (5) feet of the hive and shall extend at least two (2) feet
on either side of the hive. No such flyway barrier shall be required if all
beehives are located at least twenty-five (25) feet from all property lines and
for beehives that are located on porches or balconies at least ten (10) feet
above grade, except if such porch or balcony is located less than ten (10) feet
from a property line.
      (4)    Water Supply. A supply of fresh water shall be maintained in a
location readily accessible to all bee colonies on the site throughout the day
to prevent bees from congregating at neighboring swimming pools or other
sources of water on nearby properties.
      (5)    All beekeeping shall be in compliance with Ohio R.C. 909:
Apiaries, and all other applicable State of Ohio rules and regulations.
Property owners keeping bees must post a copy of their certificate of
registration from the Ohio Department of Agriculture on or near the hives.
      (6)    Prohibitions. No Africanized bees may be kept on a property under
the regulations of this Section.
   (f)    Sanitation and Nuisances. Farm animals shall be kept only in

provisions of this Chapter and those of other sections of this Zoning
Ordinance, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
   (c)    Permitted Uses. Residential and nonresidential uses shall be
permitted in the PUD District provided that all pertinent requirements are met
or exceeded.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1141.02 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   (a)    Minimum Project Area. The minimum size for a PUD District shall be
eight (8) contiguous acres. Smaller sites may be considered by the Planning

to be compatible with each other and not to adversely affect adjacent property
and/or the public health and general welfare.
   (h)    Building and Use Arrangements. The design and development standards
set forth in this Chapter are intended to provide considerable latitude and
freedom in order to encourage variety in the arrangement of uses and of the
location, bulk and shape of buildings, open space and landscape features.
Buildings and uses shall be arranged, designed or located in order to screen
and preserve uses within and nearby the PUD from adverse effects of uses within
or nearby the PUD. The buildings and uses may be arranged in various groups,
courts, sequences or clusters with open spaces organized and related to the
buildings and space, and to maximize the peace and tranquility of the residents

   (a)    Measurement. The area of a lot includes the total horizontal surface
area within the lot’s boundaries, not including rights-of-way.
   (b)    Contiguous Parcels. Two or more parcels, lots of record or platted
lots that are contiguous and held in common ownership may be treated together
as a single lot for purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, provided such lots are
located in the same zoning district and provided they are combined on the same
tax card. For nonconforming lots see Section
1175.04: Nonconforming Lots of Record.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1143.06 REDUCTION IN AREA PROHIBITED.

   (b)    Yards Required for Buildings. A yard or other open space required for
a building shall not be included as part of a yard or other open space for
another building.
   (c)    Variation in Front Yard. In any residential district, no front yard
depth shall be required to exceed the average minimum depths of the existing
front yards on the lots adjacent to each side, if each of such lots is within
the same block and within 100 feet of the principal building. Modification of
the front yard in accordance with this Section will not create a nonconforming
lot unless the lot or structure does not meet other applicable provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance.

inoperative vehicles or for motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind,
except emergency repairs.
      (2)    For exception see Section
1131.14: Outdoor Sales.
         (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1145.04 RULES FOR COMPUTATION.
   (a)    On-Street Parking. On-street parking spaces shall not be counted
toward off-street parking spaces requirements except as may otherwise be
provided in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    More than One Use. Where there exists two (2) principal uses on the
same lot, the parking requirements of each use shall be totaled to determine
the number of spaces required.
   (c)    Driveway Space Meeting Parking Requirements. Entrances, exits,
aisles, or driveways shall not be computed as part of the required area for
off-street parking spaces, except in the case of single-family and two-family
dwellings where driveways may be used in calculating the amount of off-street
parking.
   (d)    Fractions. When a measurement of the number of required spaces
results in a fractional number, any fraction must be rounded to the next
highest whole number.
   (e)    Unlisted Uses. Off-street parking spaces for any use not specifically
listed in Section
1145.05: Off-street Parking Schedule, shall be the same as for a similar
permitted use in the particular zoning district, as determined by the Zoning
Inspector.
   (f)    Electric Vehicle Charging Station Spaces. Parking spaces that are

intervening building or structure from the adjacent property lines shall be
landscaped in accordance with Section
1147.06: Perimeter Landscaping for Parking Areas.

limousines, or other large commercial vehicles are not permitted to be stored
or parked outside overnight on residentially-zoned property.
      (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1145.12 STORAGE OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (a)    Storage or parking of recreational vehicles is subject to the
following conditions:
      (1)    No recreational vehicle or trailer licensed to transport
recreational vehicles or equipment may be parked in the public right-of-way or
the front yard of a residential district for more than seven (7) days.
      (2)    Recreational vehicles may be stored in a residential district
either within a fully enclosed structure or carport, or within the rear or side

and shall be abated.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1145.13 OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Applicability. In connection with every building or part thereof,
except dwellings, erected after the passage of this Zoning Ordinance, there
shall be provided on the same lot with such building off-street loading spaces
or berths for uses which customarily receive or distribute material or
merchandise by vehicle. Requirements for any use not specified in this Section
shall be the same as for a similar permitted use in the particular zoning
district, as determined by the Zoning Inspector. If the commercial or
industrial establishments are such that shipping and/or receiving goods are not
an integral part of the business, the requirements listed below may be varied
or waived with provisions of written notice by the Zoning Inspector.
   (b)    Number of Loading Spaces Required.
      (1)    Office buildings, hotels, hospitals and institutions, schools and
colleges, public buildings, recreational or entertainment facilities, and any
similar use which has a gross floor area of 100,000 square feet or more shall
provide off-street truck loading or unloading berths in accordance with the
following:
 
Square Feet of Floor Area Number of Loading Spaces Required
Less than 100,000         0
100,000 to 200,000        1
200,000 and over          2 plus 1 for each additional 150,000 square feet or
                          portion thereof
      (2)    Commercial, industrial, and public utility uses, which have gross
floor area of 5,000 square feet or more, shall provide off-street truck loading
or unloading berths in accordance with the following:
 
Square Feet of Floor Area Number of Loading Spaces Required
Less than 5,000           0
5,000 to 30,000           1
30,00 and over            2 plus 1 for each additional 50,000 square feet or
                          portion thereof
   (c)    Location of Loading Spaces. Loading spaces and facilities shall be
located off-street on the same lot as the building or use being served; and may
occupy all or part of any required side or rear yard area, except that no
loading area shall be located closer than twenty (20) feet to any lot in any
residential district unless wholly enclosed within a building.
   (d)    Dimensions. Each off-street loading space shall be at least ten (10)
feet in width, fifty (50) feet in length, and shall have a vertical clear
distance of twenty-five (25) feet. The loading berth shall be designed and
located to preclude the need of a delivery vehicle to back onto a public right-
of-way.
   (e)    Screening. Loading area shall be landscaped in accordance with
Chapter
1147: Landscaping. (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1145.14 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   (a)    Purpose. The purpose of a Traffic Impact Study (TIS) is to provide
information to the City to allow for an assessment of the impact major
development projects will have on the City's transportation network. The study
provides guidance for site access, on-site circulation, parking, and off-site
improvements necessary to permit the street system to operate at a satisfactory
level of service.
   (b)    Applicability. A TIS for a proposed development shall be submitted
with the site plan, preliminary plat, or preliminary PUD plan when the
development meets any of the following criteria:
      (1)    The proposed development generates 100 or more added new peak hour
trips to and/or from the site during the adjacent roadway's peak hours or
during the development's peak hour, and the proposed development generates more
than 1,000 trips daily.
      (2)    The City Engineer determines that other conditions exist in the
vicinity of the proposed development that may be negatively impacted by the
development. Final determination of such conditions shall be determined by the
City Engineer.
      (3)    The City Engineer may waive the requirement for a TIS based on his
or her initial review of the proposed use and information available on the
streets adjacent to the subject property.
         (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1145.15 TRAFFIC ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   (a)    Applicability. These requirements shall apply to all arterial and
collector type streets, as identified in the City’s thoroughfare plan.
   (b)    Alignment and Separation of Driveways.
      (1)    To reduce left-turn conflicts, driveway ingress and egress points
shall be aligned with those across the street. If alignment is not possible,
driveways should be offset at least 150 feet.
      (2)    The offset shall be measured from edge of pavement to edge of
pavement between the two closest edges of the driveways.
      (3)    Development in the B-1 Central Business District and single-family
and two-family residential uses shall be exempt from this provision.
   (c)    Review of Access Control. In reviewing site plans which involve the
creation, or substantially increased utilization of, access points onto
arterial and collector streets, the Planning Commission shall, after City
Engineer review and recommendation, require the following:
      (1)    Provision of Reserved Turning Lanes. At those access points where
the Planning Commission determines that vehicles turning to and from the
arterial and collector streets will have a substantially negative effect on the
roadway capacity, reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
      (2)    Provision of Frontage Road. When deemed needed and feasible, after
City Engineer review and recommendation, the Planning Commission, may require
the construction of a frontage road. However, access to the arterial or
collector streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway shall be
investigated if such a design is not reasonable.
   (d)    Location of Access Points.
      (1)    Arterial Streets.
         A.    Access points on arterial streets shall be spaced a minimum
distance of 500 feet apart. Turning restrictions and/or reserved turn lanes may
be required when determined necessary by the Planning Commission after review
and recommendation from the City Engineer or a traffic impact analysis.
         B.    One access point per existing tract will be permitted; however,
if the spacing requirements for a direct access point onto an arterial street
(as provided in Subsection
1145.15(d)(1)(A) above) cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a
frontage road or on an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway
that meets the spacing requirements. In order for the intersecting local street
or frontage road to function properly, access onto them shall be located a
minimum distance of 150 feet, measured from point of curb return to point of
curb return, from the arterial street.
         C.    Where the frontage of a tract is greater than 500 feet
additional access points may be permitted. The type of turning movements
permitted from such access points may be restricted by the Planning Commission
in accordance with Subsection
1145.15(d)(1)(A) of this Section.
         D.    If an existing tract of land has no means of access that would
meet the requirements of this Section, one access point shall be provided.
      (2)    Collector Streets.
         A.    On two lane roadways, one access point per existing tract will
be allowed; however, if the frontage is greater than 400 feet, turning
restrictions and/or reserved turn lanes may be required when determined
necessary by the Planning Commission after review and recommendation from the
City Engineer or a traffic impact analysis. An additional access point may be
permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing between adjacent access points on
this type of facility shall be 100 feet, measured from point of curb return to
point of curb return, except in the case where the collector intersects another
collector street or any arterial street, in which case such access points shall
be spaced a minimum of 100 feet from the intersection, unless determined by the
Planning Commission that a greater distance from the intersection shall be
required based on traffic flow and usage.
         B.    If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the
requirements of this Section, one access point shall be provided.
   (e)    Exceptions to Access Point Requirements. The Planning Commission,
upon the recommendation from the City Engineer, may modify or waive the
requirements of this Section where the characteristics or layout of abutting
properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation
system impractical.
   (f)    Approval of Access Points Required.
      (1)    No curb cuts shall be permitted without approval from the City
Engineer as specified in Section
901.02 of the City of Fremont Codified Ordinances.
      (2)    Plans for all access points and modifications thereto, (including
plans to use existing access points where a change of use for any tract of land
would generate more traffic than the previous use, thus producing an adverse
effect on the adjacent roadway) shall be submitted to the City Engineer in a
form and number as established by the department. A separate access plan will
not be required if such access points are being located on plans, in
conjunction with off-street parking or loading and/or unloading facilities, in
accordance with this Chapter or as part of a site plan review.

   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to permit the continuance of a
lawful use of any sign existing at the effective date of adoption of this
Chapter, although such sign may not conform to the provisions of this Chapter.
It is also the intent that nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended. Sign face changes of nonconforming signs, however, are
permitted if the replacement is of equal size or less of the existing
nonconforming sign and no structural or foundation work of the existing
nonconforming sign is changed or altered as evidenced in writing by a third
party entity (i.e. a sign company) acceptable by the Zoning Inspector.
Nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition consistent with
applicable property maintenance and building code provisions. Further, it is
the intent that nonconforming signs shall be gradually eliminated and
terminated upon their natural deterioration or accidental destruction. The
continuance of all nonconforming signs within the City shall be subject to the
conditions and requirements set forth herein.
   (a)    An existing nonconforming sign may be changed or modified subject to
approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). In reviewing such cases, the
BZA must find that specific circumstances are consistent with Section
1165.01: Intent of Appeal or Variance; Subsection
1165.02(f): Decision by Board; Section
1165.05: Review Criteria for Variance Applications; and that the proposed
changes reduce the degree of nonconformity.

altered on any property prior to receipt of a required permit, a fine of fifty
dollars ($50.00) shall be imposed and the specified permit fee shall be
multiplied by four (4). However, payment of the fee shall not relieve any
person of any other requirements or penalties prescribed in this Zoning
Ordinance. Signs erected outside the provisions of this Chapter may be removed
by the City. The cost of removal and storage of such signs will be assessed
back to the property owner or the business or individual who receives the
advertising benefit of the sign.

   1155.05 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy these standards
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual, the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide
for Sandusky County, or the Ohio EPA standards, whichever are more stringent.
   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right of the
City Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent requirements,
nor shall the standards limit the right of the City Engineer to waive, in
writing, individual requirements where reasonably necessary and based upon
sound engineering practice.
   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of the
County soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (a)    The Storm Water Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so
as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)    Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen (14) days.
   (c)    Sediment Barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below.
 
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    2% but < 20%
0.125                                   20% but < 50%
   This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw bale
barriers are not acceptable.
   (d)    Storm Water Diversion Practices. Storm water diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)    All Sediment Control Practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)    Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)    Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices.  Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of earth disturbing activity.
Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended to trap
sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)    Stabilization of Denuded Areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever are most restrictive.
 
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls

                                        Within seven (7) days of the most
For all construction activities, any    recent disturbance within the area for
disturbed areas that will be within     residential subdivisions, disturbed
seven (7) days of the most recent       Areas must be stabilized at least seven
disturbance within dormant for more     (7) days prior to transfer of NPDES
than twenty-one (21) days but less than permit coverage for the individual lot
one year, and not the area for          (s). Proof of permit coverage transfer
residential subdivisions, disturbed     from Ohio EPA must be submitted to the
within fifty (50) feet of a stream      City Engineer. The City Engineer shall
                                        then inspect the lot to ensure that the
                                        temporary seeding has been done.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
      Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
   (i)    Sediment Settling Ponds: Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)    Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
              A.    Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner
can show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives in the
(Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Construction Activity) Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the site.
              B.    It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than
ten (10) acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)    Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (3)    Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least seventy-two (72)
hours, or meet the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual
whichever is most stringent.
      (4)    The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two (2) units of length for each one unit
of width (>2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)    The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five (5) feet.
      (6)    Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by forty percent (40%).
      (7)    Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)    Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)    Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)    All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the City Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)    Once final stabilization is accomplished, the developer/owner
shall remove the inlet protection devices and hydraulically clean the storm
sewers to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and the Public Works
Superintendent. All sediment shall be removed from the system and shall not be
flushed downstream.
   (k)    Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets.  All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream, channel banks, channel bottom or other areas in which the water
is outletted.
   (l)    Working Near, or Crossing Streams and Wetlands.
      (1)    Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross such
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)    No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource, unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)    If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)    No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
   (m)    Construction Entrance.
      (1)    Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)    Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be
implemented as required by the City Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be
planned and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition
of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)    Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed.
      (4)    Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (for example, wood and stone)
can be used.
   (n)    Unstable Soils.
      (1)    Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)    The City Engineer may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.
      (3)    Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)    Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ration of 3:
1 (the horizontal will be three (3) times the vertical).
   (p)    Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels. Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)    Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, has eighty percent (80%)
vegetative density over the entire disturbed area, provides adequate cover, and
is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)    Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the City Engineer. Trapped sediment shall
be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
   (s)    Underground Utility Construction.  The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)    Trenches shall remain open for no more than five (5) days.
      (2)    There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)    When discharging clean ground water, care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)    Inspections.
      (1)    If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)    The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected
for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
(7) calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a five-tenths (0.5)
inch or greater rainfall event until the City Engineer or designee inspects and
verifies the site as being stable. Such verification does not relieve the
permitee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)    The owner, or owner's designated representative, shall keep a
written log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil
erosion, sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections
shall include the date of inspection, the name of the inspector, weather
conditions, and the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)    The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (5)    If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all the required inspection sheets will be submitted to the
City Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the inspection was
conducted.
      (6)    Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)    Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Management and Sediment and Erosion Control Plan shall be observed to ensure
that they are operating correctly.
      (8)    Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving waters.
      (9)    Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
           (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need
of repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it
must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection.
Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of
the inspection.
    (11)    If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Storm Water Management and Sediment and Erosion Control Plan must
be amended and the new control practice must be installed within ten (10) days
of the inspection.
               (12)    If the inspection reveals that a control practice has
not been implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed
within ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
        (13)    If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is
not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)    Control of Materials and Debris. Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the City of Fremont's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and other such materials. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the
proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)    Excess concrete material shall not be washed into a street, catch
basin, other public facility or natural resource. A designated area shall be
made available and used for all concrete washouts.
      (3)    All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the volume of the largest container
in the storage area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority
must be followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will
be maintained in the "dike" tank at all times.
      (4)    Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)    On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminants, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)    Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)    Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of such wastes into surface or
ground waters.
              A.    Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of
excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected
sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
              B.    All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning
materials will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)    Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)    All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)    Pre-winter Stabilization. If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting before October 1st. The owner
shall invite the operator, developer, engineer, contractor, City Engineer and
anyone else requested by the City Engineer to the meeting.
      (Ord. 2021-4065. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1155.06 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and volumes
may include, but are not limited to permanent retention ponds and lakes, dry
detention basins, and subsurface detention systems.
   (a)    Storm Water Basins.
      (1)    Pool geometry.  The recommended length-to-width ratio for the pond
is 3:1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)    Riser in embankment. The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)    Water drains. Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposits from plugging the drain.
      (4)    Principal spillway.  Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)    Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on
each storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the City Engineer.
   (b)    Embankments.  Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rainwater and Land Development manual, the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide
for Sandusky County, and the Ohio EPA standards, whichever are more stringent.
Anti-seep collars shall be proved for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (1)    Safety features.
              A.    The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
              B.    The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than
three (3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.    A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three percent (3%),
which extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a
minimum of twenty-five (25) feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals
and maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench
may be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the
water pool.
            2.    Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.    An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of fifteen (15) inches
below the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped
to prevent access to the deeper water pool.
            4.    Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.    The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.    Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and
shall terminate on a safety bench.
   (c)    Runoff Rate.  The peak runoff rate from the development area shall
not be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations demonstrating no increases in the runoff rates from
the one (1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one
hundred (100) year storms.
   (d)    Runoff Volume.  Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)    Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)    From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development (2) using this percentage,
select the critical storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase In volume of Runoff is:
Equal To or  And Less The 24-Hour
Greater Than Than     “Critical Storm”
                      For Discharge Will Be
0            10       1 Year
10           20       2 Years
20           50       5 Years
50           100      10 Years
100          250      25 Years
250          500      50 Years
500          ---      100 Years
   (e)    Water Quality.  To meet the post-construction requirements of this
Chapter, the Storm Water Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan must
contain a description of the Post-Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs)
that will be installed during construction for the site and the rationale for
their selection. The rationale must address the anticipated impacts on the
channel and floodplain morphology, hydrology, and water quality.
      (1)    Structural BMPs. Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
              A.    Properly Sized BMPs. The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to
treat the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water
Quality Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the
volume of runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to
one of the two following methods:
            1.    Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-term hourly
precipitation records; or
            2.    Using the following equation:
            WQv    = C * P * A/12 where:
            WQv    = water quality volume in acre-feet
             C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
             1 inch (see Table 5)
             P    = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
             A   = area draining into the BMP in acres.
 
Table 5: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas               0.2
         B.    Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if sixty percent (60%) of
the contributing drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low
Density Residential, thirty percent (30%) is High Density Residential, and ten
percent (10%) is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows
(0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) = 0.35.
              C.    An additional volume equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
WQv shall be incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced
infiltration capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology
included in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-
Construction storm water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio
EPA.
              D.    BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long
enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as described in Table 6 below:
Table 6: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural
Post-Construction Treatment Control Practices
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration                                24 - 48 Hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 Hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 Hours
Retention Basins (West Basins)*             24 Hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 Hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 Hours
            *Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume
above the permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQv
         E.    The owner may request approval from the City Engineer to utilize
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is consistent with Ohio EPA rules and regulations that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 6
above. The use of alternative or vendor supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 6 are technically and economically unfeasible.
         F.    Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if
it can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP which is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan.
         G.    For redevelopment projects (namely, developments on previously
developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a twenty
percent (20%) net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment
of at least twenty percent (20%) of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (2)    Water quality basin. If a Water Quality Basin is needed and cannot
be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin then a
separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
   (f)    The requirements shall be satisfied at each location where runoff
leaves the development area. The runoff rates and volumes shall be considered
for both the conditions before and after development at these locations.
   (g)    To ensure the continued functioning of storm water control
structures, the following information shall be identified to the satisfaction
of the City Engineer.
      (1)    The person or entity responsible for continued maintenance of the
storm water control structure shall be identified to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer.
      (2)    Maintenance requirements and schedules;
      (3)    Permanent access easements required for those conducting
maintenance to perform inspection and maintenance of storm water control
structures and storm water conveyance systems. The minimum size of an easement
shall be approved by the City Engineer. Within such easements, no person shall
plant trees, shrubbery, plantings, or construct buildings, fences, or walls
that obstruct free flow of storm water or obstruct the movement of construction
equipment.
      (4)    An owner or owners of two (2) or more existing or proposed lots
may apply for approval of a SWM plan serving more than one lot. Such plan shall
comply with applicable provisions of this chapter and all other relevant laws
and ordinances. No subdivision of lands or building permit shall be approved
under any multiple lot plan until owners of all affected lots have entered into
a mutual agreement or formed an association for joint maintenance of the SWM
facility and until all easements needed to effectuate the plan have been
granted. The mutual agreement or association and the easements must be signed,
acknowledged, delivered and recorded in the manner for documents relating to
real estate titles.
   (h)    Detention or retention basin exemption for development or for
expansion of existing facilities:
      (1)    For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for the one (1) year through 100 year frequency
twenty-four (24) hour storm causes no increase to the existing peak discharge
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the City
Engineer. Even if the determination is made that a detention or retention basin
is not required, the development still must comply with BMPs to address pre and
post development storm water quality control such as installation of mechanical
cleaning devices to capture sediments as approved by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 2021-4065. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1155.07 COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
   (a)    NPDES Permits. The provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permits, issued by the Ohio EPA, shall be followed.
Proof of compliance shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the Ohio EPA
NPDES Permit number, or a letter from the site owner explaining why the NPDES
Permit is not applicable. Such written proof will be provided to the City
Engineer before a construction permit will be issued.
   (b)    Federal and State Wetland Permits. The provisions of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers dredge and fill permits for federally-protected wetlands
shall be followed. The provisions of Ohio EPA's Isolated Wetlands Permits shall
also be followed. Wetlands and other waters of the United States shall be
delineated by protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Ohio EPA at the time of application of these regulations. Written proof of
compliance with both permit programs will be provided to the City Engineer
prior to final Planning Commission approval. Proof of compliance shall be, but
is not limited to, the following:

the City Engineer by May 1st each year. In the event that corrective measures
are required, the City Engineer may issue a notice of violation which shall
identify all deficiencies and designate a time frame for correction. If after
subsequent inspection the corrections are not made, then the City Engineer may
issue a citation for violations to the owner or person responsible for
maintenance of the facility, in accordance with Section 1155.12 of this
Chapter. If all corrections are not performed within a prescribed time period,
the City may elect to pursue the matter as a violation, make the necessary
corrections and assess the costs as a tax assessment/lien to the responsible
party and property owner.
   (c)    The developer shall cause the above maintenance and reporting
obligations to be inserted into the chain of title to the affected lands as a
covenant running with the land. Such documentation may include but not be
limited to reference on a plat and/or inclusion in a declaration of covenants
and restrictions for a subdivision.
   (d)    Upon notice from the City Engineer, or designated representative,
that work is being performed contrary to this chapter, such work shall
immediately stop. Such cease and desist notice shall be in writing and shall be

take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
     (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.
            (1)    Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this
chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may
petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
           (2)    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior
approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
         (Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.07 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.08 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)    Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with residential, commercial, industrial or
institutional activity, including construction activity.
  
     (b)    Access to Facilities.
            (1)    The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger
has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry onto its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency.
            (2)    Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement
agency ready access to all areas of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be
maintained under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water,
and for the performance of any additional duties as defined by State and
federal law.
            (3)    The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to
set up on any permitted facility any such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
            (4)    The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
            (5)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement
agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
            (6)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement
agency access to a permitted facility is itself a violation of a storm water
discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a
facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
            (7)    If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.09 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying BMPs
for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or water of
the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.10 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structure will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.11 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment
and cleanup of such release. In the event of such release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement
agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. (Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.12 CONFLICTS; SEVERABILITY; NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)    Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other City provisions of law, ordinance, contract or
deed, then in such event the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
      
   (b)    If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of this chapter invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
      (c)    This chapter shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Neither shall
compliance with the provisions of this chapter constitute a defense in any
action to abate such nuisance.
   
   (d)    Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve any person
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therein.
(Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.13 NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
   Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, then the
authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person. In instances where immediate action is
deemed necessary for public safety or the public interest, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance verbally, pending issuance of a written
order. Such notice may require without limitation:
      (a)    The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
     (b)    The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
      (c)    Cessation and desist of the violating discharges, practices or
operations;
     (d)    The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      (e)    Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
     (f)    The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
      If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work shall be performed by the authorized enforcement agency or a contractor
designated by the City of Fremont, and the expense thereof shall be charged to
the violator.
(Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.14 APPEALS.
   Any person receiving notice of violation may appeal any decision of the
authorized enforcement agency with regard to enforcement or interpretation of
this chapter to the City of Fremont Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA). The decision
of the BZA shall be final and conclusive unless appealed by the aggrieved party
within thirty (30) days of the decision of the BZA. Any appeal from the
decision of the BZA shall be filed in Common Pleas Court of Sandusky County,
Ohio. (Ord. 2021-4064. Passed 5-6-21.)
   1156.99 PENALTY; REMEDIES.
   (a)    Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, and shall be fined not
more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), or imprisoned not more than
thirty (30) days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.
       (b)    The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City, by or through its Law Director and/or authorized designees,
from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper
jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain, enjoin, correct
or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this
chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations or the
lawful orders of the authorized enforcement agency; or to impose any other
available civil remedy or sanction against any person or organization convicted
of an offense under this chapter, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine
imposed pursuant to this section, including the imposition upon the offender of
liability to the City for any expense, loss or damage incurred by the City by
reason of such violation.
      The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other
remedies available under any applicable federal, State or local law; and it is
within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.

1175.03    General compliance standards.
1175.04    Nonconforming lots of record.
1175.05    Nonconforming structures.
1175.06    Nonconforming uses.
1175.07    Certificate of Nonconforming Use.
   1175.01 INTENT.
   At the time of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, there exist lots of
record, structures and uses of structures and land which do not conform to the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance. While such conditions are generally
permitted to continue, the purpose of this Chapter is to:
   (a)    Set forth specific procedures and requirements controlling the
continuation, expansion or alteration of such nonconformities, and in certain
cases, to establish specific requirements to eliminate such conditions.
   (b)    It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that
nonconformities shall not be encouraged to expand without restrictions, nor be
used as a means for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district.
      (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.02 INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Nonconforming uses are declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A
nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended
or enlarged in any way, including attachment to a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district
in which such use is located, except as hereafter provided in this Chapter.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.03 GENERAL COMPLIANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)    Passage of this Zoning Ordinance in no way legalizes any illegal uses
existing at the time of its adoption.
   (b)    The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard of building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure
nonconforming.
   (c)    Nonconforming buildings, structures or uses shall not be extended,
enlarged, restored, structurally altered, moved to another zoning lot or
relocated within the same lot except in conformance with the regulations of
this Chapter.
   (d)    The change in ownership of a nonconforming building, structure, use
or lot of record does not, in itself, require the nonconformity to be
corrected.
   (e)    Nonconforming uses which have been discontinued or structures
containing nonconforming uses removed for a period of twelve (12) consecutive
months shall not be re-established except in conformity with the requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance. Nonconforming uses include use of land, structures
and/or equipment and fixtures.
   (f)    No nonconforming portion of a building or structure shall be
reconstructed or structurally altered to an extent exceeding in cost fifty
percent (50%) of the value at which the building or structure’s market value,
as determined by the Sandusky County Auditor, unless such reconstruction or
alteration reduces the extent of the nonconforming development. These cost
limitations may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals under Subsection
1165.01(b): Variance.
   (g)    If any nonconforming building, structure or use is damaged to an
extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its market value, such structure shall
only be rebuilt in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
Such reconstruction shall require the application and issuance of all
applicable zoning and building permits.
   (h)    A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use
is not rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a church,
public or private school, public park or library within 1,500 feet, or a
residential district within 1,000 feet, of the sexually oriented business.
   (i)    An applicant for any development review procedure that deals with
nonconformity shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use was
a legal nonconformity on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance and/or
Zoning Amendment.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)    Residential Lots. Any lot of record existing at the effective date of
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or any of its subsequent amendments, which
does not conform to the lot requirements of the district in which it is
located, is to be considered a nonconforming lot of record.
      (1)    Where there exists one (1) nonconforming lot of record in single
ownership, with frontage along a public right of way, such shall be considered
a buildable lot for the district in which it is located if the dwelling unit
can meet the square footage requirements of that district.
      (2)    Where two (2) or more contiguous, nonconforming, vacant lots of
record are in single ownership, the Zoning Inspector may require replatting to
minimize the nonconformity. The replatted lots shall be approved by the
Planning Commission and once approved, the replatted lots shall be considered
as having met the lot size requirements of this Zoning Ordinance. The number of
replatted lots of record shall at least equal one-half (½) of the original
number of lots of record.
   (b)    Commercial and Industrial Lots.
      (1)    Lots of record which are presently used, or have been used, for
commercial or industrial uses within an existing commercial or industrial
zoning district and which ownership was on record at the time of adoption of
the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Amendment which do not meet the requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance for minimum lot width or minimum set-back line, minimum
lot frontage, minimum lot area, or minimum open space, may be utilized for
commercial or industrial uses under conditions established by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)    The purpose of this provision is to permit utilization of recorded
lots though they may not meet minimum area requirements of the district of
which they are part of; however, the Board of Zoning Appeals, under proper
application, and for good cause, may vary minimum area and set-back
requirements on existing substandard lots, subject to Section 1165.04:
Procedure for Variance.
         (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, that could not be built under the terms of
this Zoning Ordinance, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful. Any proposed enlargement or alteration of nonconforming
buildings or structures must meet the provisions in Section
1175.03: General Compliance Standards, and Section
1175.04: Nonconforming Lots of Record.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.06 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where otherwise lawful uses of land or structures exist at the effective
date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, which would
not be permitted by the regulation contained in this Zoning Ordinance, such
uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful.
   (a)    Expansion of a nonconforming use into a part of a building or
structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such uses
are allowed.
   (b)    No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    A nonconforming building, structure, or premises, if changed to a use
permitted in the district in which the lot is located, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformity with the said permitted use in that district; a
nonconforming building, structure, or premises may be changed to another use
only if such use is included in the district in which the nonconforming use is
a part.
   (d)    A request for change in the nonconforming use of a lot or structure
shall be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals and accompanied by a complete
application and fee. Review process shall follow the procedures set for in
Section
1165.04: Procedure for Variance.
   (e)    Any use of a specific property which is conditionally permitted in a
zoning district in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance
shall not be considered as a nonconforming use in the zoning district in which
it is conditionally permitted. Such conditionally permitted use shall be
considered a conforming use on the particular lot on which it is located, if it
meets all of the requirements of the district in which it is located.
   (f)    A nonconforming business may expand its off-street parking area on to
an adjacent lot or lots providing that the buffering and landscaping
requirements of Chapter
1147: Landscaping, are met and the Board of Zoning Appeals follows procedures
of Chapter
1163: Conditional Permitted Uses, and issue a conditional use permit.
   (g)    Any other expansion of a nonconforming use shall not be allowed into
adjacent lots purchased after the Zoning Ordinance made the original building a
nonconforming use or into adjacent lots previously owned by the same land owner
and used in conformity with the Zoning Ordinance and which did not qualify as a
nonconforming use.
      (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1175.07 CERTIFICATE OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   For existing nonconformities, landowners may request and obtain from the
Zoning Inspector a certificate showing nonconforming use status.
   (a)    In accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, no use of land,
building or structures shall be made other than that specified on the
certificate of nonconforming use unless such use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the use district in which the property is located.
   (b)    A copy of each certificate of nonconforming use shall be kept on file
in the Zoning office. (Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)

receipt requested, or by other means, to ensure actual notice to persons
responsible for any alleged violation. Such notice shall state the reasons why
the Zoning Inspector believes there is a violation in fact and shall require an
answer or a correction of the alleged violation, as determined by the Zoning
Inspector, within a reasonable time limit set by the Zoning Inspector. The
notice shall also state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or
correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector
within the set time limit constitutes an admission of the violation.
(Ord. 2020-4053. Passed 1-7-21.)
   1177.03 RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The manner in which persons responsible for an alleged violation of this
Zoning Ordinance respond to the notice of violation shall determine the course
of action taken by the Zoning Inspector as follows:

set, the alleged violation is corrected, as determined by the Zoning Inspector,

official City records.

no legal action shall be initiated by the City against those responsible for
the alleged violation until after the Board has made its determination.
   (c)    Request for Extension of Time. If a reply is received within the time
limit set indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected, but that more
time is required than was granted by the original notice, the Zoning Inspector
may grant an extension of time, if he or she deems such extension is warranted
by the circumstances of the case, and if such extension will not, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health or property. In acting on such a
request, the Zoning Inspector shall state his or her reasons in writing, for
granting or refusing to grant the extension and shall transmit the same by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means to ensure actual
notice, to those to whom original notice was sent.
   (d)    No Correction and No Reply. If there is no reply within the time
limit set, thus establishing an admission of the violation as provided in
Section

satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector within the time limit set, he or she shall
take or cause to be taken such action as is warranted by the continuation of an
admitted violation.

         (Ord. 84-2312. Passed 5-17-84.)
   1305.06  PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state:
      (1)   The name and address of the person aggrieved;
      (2)   The name and address of the person against whom the complaint is
filed;
      (3)   A description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice; and
      (4)   A concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates,
constituting the alleged discriminatory housing practice, and such other
information as may be required by the Board.
   The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the Secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigations shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigations may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the Secretary
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conference shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion, dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary. The Board shall not dismiss such
complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to appear before
the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
opened to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued shall be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of any
attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to
cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be
given under oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of
the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person,
and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall
furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board
deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as shall effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that the
person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board shall
recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought
in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter the Board shall so state and publish its findings
and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 84-2312. Passed 5-17-84.)
   1305.99 PENALTY.
   In any proceeding where the court determines that there has been a violation
of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and where
appropriate, punitive damages of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
along with attorney fees and court costs. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate which may include, but is not
limited to, issuance of any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order.

   1307.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.” See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Fremont’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
   “Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)” means a revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   “Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)” means a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   “Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)” means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial Flood Regulations effective
date, April 16, 1987, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2011-3547. Passed 4-7-11.)
   1307.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Fremont, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Fremont has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Fremont as identified in Section
1307.02(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Fremont.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   The “Flood Insurance Study Sandusky County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” and “Flood Insurance Rate Map Sandusky County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” both effective April 18, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Fremont as required by Section
1307.05(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Fremont, 323 South Front Street.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Fremont, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2011-
3547. Passed 4-7-11.)
   1307.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer is
hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and is referred
to herein as the Floodplain Administrator.
   (b)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include but
are not limited to:
      (1)   Evaluate applications for permits to develop in special flood
hazard areas.
      (2)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and flood
protection elevation information.
      (3)   Issue permits to develop in special flood hazard areas when the
provisions of these regulations have been met, or refuse to issue the same in
the event of noncompliance.
      (4)   Inspect buildings and lands to determine whether any violations of
these regulations have been committed.
      (5)   Make and permanently keep all records for public inspection
necessary for the administration of these regulations including Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Letters of Map Amendment and Revision, records of issuance and
denial of permits to develop in special flood hazard areas, determinations of
whether development is in or out of special flood hazard areas for the purpose
of issuing floodplain development permits, elevation certificates, variances,
and records of enforcement actions taken for violations of these regulations.
      (6)   Enforce the provisions of these regulations.
      (7)   Provide information, testimony, or other evidence as needed during
variance hearings.
      (8)   Coordinate map maintenance activities and FEMA follow-up.
      (9)   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations.
   (c)   Floodplain Development Permits. It shall be unlawful for any person to
begin construction or other development activity including but not limited to
filling; grading; construction; alteration, remodeling, or expanding any
structure; or alteration of any watercourse wholly within, partially within or
in contact with any identified special flood hazard area, as established in
Section
1307.02(f), until a floodplain development permit is obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator. Such floodplain development permit shall show that
the proposed development activity is in conformity with the provisions of these
regulations. No such permit shall be issued by the Floodplain Administrator
until the requirements of these regulations have been met.
   (d)   Application Required. An application for a floodplain development
permit shall be required for all development activities located wholly within,
partially within, or in contact with an identified special flood hazard area.
Such application shall be made by the owner of the property or his/her
authorized agent, herein referred to as the applicant, prior to the actual
commencement of such construction on a form furnished for that purpose. Where
it is unclear whether a development site is in a special flood hazard area, the

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Fremont’s flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1307.02(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1307.05(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1307.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development that increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1307.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Fremont, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Fremont have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Fremont’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City’s
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Fremont suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1307.04, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance may be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council of the City
of Fremont.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on
all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1307.04(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1307.05(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,

   (a)   Whenever complaint is made to the Fire Chief of the existence of a

the premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists. Should the

the aforesaid property. The Fire Chief shall leave a copy of the aforesaid
notice with the person in possession of such premises, if any, or if there is
no person in possession thereof, he shall post a copy of the notice on the
premises. It shall be the duty of the Fire Chief to inspect the premises on
which it is alleged that such nuisance exists and to make a written report of
his findings in conjunction therewith to the Safety-Service Director. Should
the Fire Chief and the Director find that a public nuisance exists and that the
nature thereof is such as to require its summary abatement, it shall be the
duty of the Fire Chief to cause photographs of such nuisance to be made, to
file and keep in his office the written reports of the findings aforesaid, and
further, to cause the abatement of the aforesaid nuisance within three days of
the time within which such findings are reported by him. In abating such
nuisance, the Fire Chief shall not be required to give any further notice to
the owner thereof.
   (b)   The remedy provided in this section shall be in addition to any
penalty in Section
1505.99.
   (c)   If the owner, within thirty days thereafter fails, neglects, or
refuses to repay the Fire Chief the expenses incurred by him in abating the
public nuisance, the City Auditor shall certify such expenses, together with a
twenty-five percent (25%) penalty thereon to the County Auditor, and the
Auditor shall enter such expense on the tax duplicate of the County as a

situated, and the same shall be collected as other taxes and, when collected

person in possession thereof, he shall post a copy of the notice on the
premises.
   (b)   The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief, the findings of the Fire
Chief and shall further state that unless the owner or owners thereof shall
cause the abatement of the public nuisance therein defined within thirty days

at the expense of such owner or owners.
(Ord. 988. Passed 6-15-67.)

   (a)   Should the nuisance not be abated as ordered under Section
1505.03 at the expiration of the time stated in such notice, the Fire Chief
shall have the right to enter upon such premises and to abate the nuisance
found thereon. In abating such nuisance he may go to whatever extent may be
necessary to complete the abatement of the same and should it be practicable to
sell
or salvage any material derived in the aforesaid abatement he may sell the same
at private or public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an
account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in
the General Fund of the City and any difference between the amount so received
and the cost of the abatement shall be levied as an assessment against the
aforesaid property by Council, certified to the Sandusky County Auditor and
collected as any other assessment by the City. Should the proceeds of the sale
of such salvaged material exceed the cost of such abatement, the overage, if
any, shall be paid to the owner of the premises from which such nuisance was
abated when his proper claim therefor is established. In abating such nuisance
the Fire Chief may call upon the Department of Public Safety-Service for
whatever assistance may be necessary or may, by private contract, obtain the
abatement thereof if such private contract is first authorized by Council.

penalty provided in Section

public nuisance, the City Auditor shall certify such expenses, together with a
twenty-five percent (25%) penalty thereon to the County Auditor, and the
Auditor shall enter such expenses on the tax duplicate of the County as a
