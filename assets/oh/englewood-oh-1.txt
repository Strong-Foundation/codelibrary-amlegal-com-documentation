(Amended 11-4-80.)
SECTION 1.04. CONSTRUCTION.

   (b)   A majority of the members of Council shall constitute a quorum.

   (a)   The office of Councilmember or Mayor shall become vacant upon his
death, resignation, violation of Section 2.03 of this Charter, recall in
accordance with Section 6.01 of this Charter, conviction of a crime involving
moral turpitude, felony, or his failure to attend three (3) consecutive regular
meetings of the Council without being excused by a majority of the other
members.
   (b)   If a vacancy occurs on or before the second June 30 following the
commencement of a term, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by a
majority of the remaining members of Council; but such appointment shall expire
immediately following the certification of the results of the next Councilmanic
election. Whether or not such appointment was made, the vacancy for the
unexpired term shall be filled at the next regular Councilmanic election. The

following the commencement of a term, the Vice Mayor shall become Mayor, and
the resulting vacancy on Council shall be filled in accordance with Section
2.11(b). Council shall then elect one of its members to be Vice Mayor until the
next reorganization meeting of Council.
   (e)   If a vacancy on Council occurs and no appointment to fill the vacancy
can be made because no qualified candidate for appointment receives a majority
vote of the remaining Councilmembers within forty-five (45) days of the
official announcement that a vacancy exists, the Mayor shall appoint one of the
qualified candidates to fill the vacancy.
(.Amended 11-4-80.)

Council only after consultation with the Manager. Where the administrative code
is silent, the officers and employees of the Municipality shall have all powers
and duties provided for similar officers and employees by general law; however,
the provisions of the administrative code shall supersede those of the State
law in case of conflict.
SECTION 3.08 DIRECTOR OF LAW.

practice law in the State of Ohio. He shall perform such duties as may be
assigned to the office of City Solicitor by general law, as well as those

part-time basis as determined by the Manager. He need not be or become a
resident of the Municipality.

necessary costs of the Municipality, it may, by resolution adopted by a
majority vote thereof for a general election, or, by resolution adopted by an
affirmative vote of two thirds thereof for a special election, call for an
election on the question of increasing tax rates. Such resolution shall specify
the purpose or purposes of the proposed levy, the rate thereof, the length of
time during which such rate shall be in effect, and the date of the proposed
election thereon, which date can be at a general election or other date. Such
resolution shall be effective upon approval, and shall be certified forthwith
to the Board of Elections. If a majority of those voting therein vote for the

(Ord. 76-02. Passed 2-10-76. )
206.03 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   The presiding officer or a majority of the members of a public body may call
an executive session, limited to members of the public body and such other
persons as it may designate, at a regular or special meeting of the public body
for the purpose of consideration of any of the following matters:
   (a)   The appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline, promotion,
demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the investigation
of charges or complaints against a public employee, official, licensee or
regulated individual, unless the public employee, official, licensee or
regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise provided by
law, no executive session shall be for the discipline of an elected official
for conducted related to the performance of his or her official duties or for
his or her removal from office.
   (b)   The purchase of property for public purposes, or the sale of property
at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information would give an
unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose personal and/or
private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member shall use
this division as a subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective
buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller
or buyer of the public property has received covert information from a member
that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and deliberations
of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this section, any
instrument executed by the City purporting to convey, lease or otherwise
dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this section
insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or
transferees of the property is concerned.
   (c)   Conferences with an attorney for the City concerning disputes
involving the City that are the subject of pending or imminent court action;
   (d)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
   (e)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or
State statutes;
   (f)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law; and
   (g)   Any matter which would tend to defame or prejudice the character or
reputation of any person, provided that the general subject matter for
consideration is expressed in the motion calling for such session and that
final action thereon is not taken by the public body except as an agenda item
at a public meeting.
(Ord. 76-02. Passed 2-10-76. )

until the Secretary receives written notice from such medium cancelling or
modifying such requests, whichever is earlier. Each requesting news medium
shall be informed of such period of effectiveness at the time it files its
request. Such requests may be modified or extended only by filing a complete
new request with the Secretary. A request shall not be deemed to be made unless
it is complete in all respects.
   (c)   Any person may, upon request to the Secretary and advance payment to
the City of one dollar ($1. 00) for each month such notification is requested,

Secretary shall maintain a record of the date, manner and time, if pertinent,
of all actions taken with regard to notices and notifications required herein.
   (i)   No action of a public body is valid unless taken in a regular or
special meeting. Actions taken in regular or special meetings shall be presumed
valid and in compliance with this section.
   (j)   Upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this section in
an action brought by any person, the Court of Common Pleas shall issue an
injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions. A member who knowingly violates an injunction issued pursuant to
this section may be removed from office by an action brought in the Court of
Common Pleas for that purpose by the Director of Law.
   (k)   Pursuant to Section
1.02 of the City Charter, the provisions of this section shall prevail over any
general law of the State in conflict herewith.

   (b)   Special Meetings. The Mayor or a majority of the members of Council
may call special meetings upon at least twenty-four hours notice, whenever
practical, to each member, served personally by mail or left at each member’s
usual place of residence.
      (1)   Any member of Council may call the Clerk of Council and advise the
Clerk that the Council member desires a special meeting of Council to be called
for a purpose or purposes, naming it or them.
      (2)   Immediately upon receiving this information, the Clerk shall call
the Mayor. If the Mayor approves, he or she shall forthwith instruct the Clerk
to call a special meeting of Council, naming the purpose or purposes thereof
which shall include the purpose or purposes named by the first Council member.
      (3)   If the Mayor does not approve, the Clerk shall forthwith call all
of the other members of Council. If three of them wish to have a special
meeting called, the Clerk shall advise all of the members of Council and the
Mayor that a special meeting has been called by four members of Council for the
purpose or purposes originally stated and at a time to be set by the Clerk,
with advice from the several Council members and Mayor, but as soon as
practical and including as many members as practical.
      (4)   Any member of Council may request that the Clerk advise the Mayor
and other members of Council that he or she will present a motion for an

subjects, and the Clerk shall comply.
   (c)   Closed Sessions. All meetings where official business is consummated
shall be public. However, Council may recess for the purpose of discussing in a
closed session, limited to its own membership and such other persons as it may
designate, any matter which would tend to defame or prejudice the character or
reputation of any person, provided that the general subject matter for
consideration is expressed in the motion calling for such session and that
final action thereon is not taken by Council except as an agenda item at a
public meeting.
   (d)   Executive Sessions. The Mayor or a majority of the members of Council
may call an executive session, limited to members of Council and such other
persons as it may designate, at a regular or special meeting, provided that the
general subject matter for consideration is expressed in the motion calling for
such session and that final action thereon is not taken by Council except as an
agenda item at a public meeting, for the purpose of a consideration of any of
the following matters:
      (1)   The appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline, promotion,
demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the investigation
of charges or complaints against a public employee, official, licensee or
regulated individual, unless the public employee, official, licensee or
regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise provided by
law, no executive session shall be for the discipline of an elected official
for conduct related to the performance of his or her official duties or for his
or her removal from office.
      (2)   The purchase of property for public purposes, or the sale of
property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information would
give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose personal
and/or private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
shall use this division as a subterfuge for providing covert information to
prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if
the seller or buyer of the public property has received covert information from
a member that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time
for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
            If the minutes of Council show that all meetings and deliberations
of Council have been conducted in compliance with this section, any instrument
executed by the City purporting to convey, lease or otherwise dispose of any
right, title or interest in any public property shall be conclusively presumed
to have been executed in compliance with this section insofar as title or other
interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is
concerned.

conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or
State statutes; or
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   (e)   Workshop Sessions. As provided in this section, the Mayor or a
majority of the members of Council may call special meetings of Council to be
designated “workshop sessions,” which shall be open to the public, upon at
least twenty-four hours notice to each member, served personally, for the
purpose of receiving and/or discussing information pertinent to pending action.
   (f)   Requests and Notifications.
      (1)   The Clerk of Council shall post the schedule and location of
regular meetings of Council in the south foyer of the Englewood Government
Center.

special meetings and workshops of Council in the south foyer of the Englewood
Government Center as soon as practical after the meeting is called.
      (3)   The Clerk of Council shall give notice of special meetings and
workshops to the news media which have requested notification at least twenty-
four hours before the meeting by mailing a copy of the agenda of the meeting by
regular mail to the news media offices, except in the case of emergency
meetings requiring immediate Council action, in which case the Clerk shall give
immediate oral notification to the news media that have requested notification
of the time, place and purpose of the meeting.

notice of special meetings and workshops shall file with the Clerk of Council a

and telephone numbers at which notification may be given either during or
outside of business hours) of at least two persons to either one of whom oral
notifications to the medium may be given, and at least one telephone number
which the request identifies as being manned and which can be called at any
hour for the purpose of giving oral notification to such medium. Such requests
shall be effective for one year from the date of filing with the Clerk or until
the Clerk receives written notice from such medium cancelling or modifying such
requests, whichever is earlier. Each requesting news medium shall be informed
of such period of effectiveness at the time it files its request. Such requests
may be modified or extended only by filing a complete new request with the
Clerk. A request shall not be deemed to be made unless it is complete in all
respects.
      (5)   Any person may, upon request to the Clerk and advance payment to
the City of one dollar ($1.00) for each month such notification is requested,
obtain advance notification of Council meetings at which any specific type of
public business is to be discussed. Notice shall be made by mailing a copy of
the agenda of the meeting by regular mail or by oral notification a reasonable
time in advance of the meeting.
      (6)   Persons requesting advance notification of meetings at which any
specific type of public business is scheduled to be discussed shall file a
written request with the Clerk specifying the person's name, addresses and
telephone numbers at or through which the person can be reached during and
outside of business hours, the specific type of public business the discussion

   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   The City Manager shall act as Purchasing Agent for the City, making
all purchases required by the various departments and selling unused, worn out,
surplus or obsolete equipment and materials. The City Manager may delegate any
portion of the Purchasing Agent’s duties to the head of a department or
division.
      (2)   Whenever the head of a department or division deems it necessary or
desirable that supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services be
purchased or secured, such department head or division head shall prepare a
purchase order, as set forth in division (c) of this section.
      (3)   If the probable cost thereof will be fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) or more, the Purchasing Agent shall resort to formal bidding, as
hereinafter provided. If the probable cost will be less than fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000), the Purchasing Agent may award the purchase to the supplier
offering the lowest and best bid among the informal bidders or award a contract
without competitive selection. Exceptions to the outlined procedures include
obligations for professional services and utilities, including, but not limited
to phone, electric and gas. (See Section
236.02.)
   (b)   Formal Bidding.
      (1)   Whenever formal bidding is necessary by reason of the probable
amount involved, the Purchasing Agent shall prepare or cause to be prepared
specifications for the article or services required and shall advertise the
requirements of the City at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City, inviting vendors to tender bids, in writing, for the furnishing of
such requirements, such bids to be publicly opened not less than ten days
following the date of the first advertisement, at a time and place specified in
the published notice. The bids shall be opened and tabulated publicly by the
Purchasing Agent or his or her designee. An investigation of the responsibility
of the bidders shall be made if the Purchasing Agent deems it necessary.
      (2)   The Manager shall report to Council the bids and the results of any
investigation of the responsibility of the bidders and shall recommend to
Council the selection of the lowest and best bid, or, if the Manager determines
that the interest of the City would be better served, the rejection of all
bids.
      (3)   No contract for the purchase of goods or services at a cost of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more shall be made unless Council has, by
ordinance or resolution, authorized and directed the City Manger to do so.
   (c)   Purchase Orders.
      (1)   After following the proper bidding process, the head of the
department or division head will prepare a purchase order addressed to the
successful bidder, directing the vendor to supply the goods or services
required in accordance with the terms agreed upon. If the value of the goods or
services exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00), the City Manager must
authorize the purchase. Otherwise, the head of the department or division has
authority to make the purchase. All purchase orders shall be submitted to the
Director of Finance and/or the City Manager for certification. (See Section
236.02.)
      (2)   Blanket purchase orders may be issued for an estimated year’s
supply of standardized material or services or to a supplier of various items
where buying convenience or a quantity discount is a factor.
   (d)   Petty Cash. If the item to be purchased is less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the purchase is considered to be petty cash. The head of the
department or division shall approve all petty cash purchases using the proper
form provided by the Finance Department.
   (e)   Inspection. The Purchasing Agent shall inspect or supervise the
inspection of all deliveries of supplies, materials, equipment or contractual
services to determine their conformity with the specifications set forth in or
referred to in the order or contract.
   (f)   Execution of Contracts. Unless otherwise specifically stated by a
resolution or ordinance of Council, all contracts made by and on behalf of the
City shall be signed by the City Manager or by the person appointed to act in
the absence of the City Manager.
   (g)   State Law Superseded.
      (1)   The bidding requirements and procedures set forth in this section
are enacted pursuant to the City’s home rule powers of local self-government
and are intended to completely supersede any and all bidding requirements and
procedures set forth for the purchase of supplies, materials, equipment or
contractual services by municipal corporations under the Ohio Revised Code. Any
such bidding requirements and procedures set forth under the Ohio Revised Code
are, therefore, hereby declared to be inoperable.
      (2)   Any contract awarded pursuant to this section shall be in
accordance with the City Charter and the ordinances of the City, therefore
exempting the City from, but not limited to, the provisions of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 153 and Ohio R.C. 735.074, et al.
   (h)   Limited Liability. Under no circumstances shall the payments to the
contractor or the City’s liability exceed the amount set forth in the proposal
or contract without a properly executed change order.
   (i)   Emergency Purchases. When, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent, an
immediate order or purchase in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) is
required to preserve the public health, welfare or safety, the Manager shall be
authorized to commit such expenditure on behalf of the City. The Manager shall
retroactively solicit Council’s legislative approval.
   (j)   Change Orders. The City Manager is hereby authorized to execute a
change order or other necessary modification to a contract approved by Council
in order to properly and expeditiously administer construction projects or
other purchases, provided that such modification does not exceed 10% of the
original contract amount. If a change order or purchase exceeds 10% of the
original contract amount, the City Manager shall obtain Council’s re-approval
and provide an explanation as to the necessity for the increase.
   (k)   Purchase of Fuels, Utilities and Road De-Icing Salts. The Purchasing
Agent is hereby authorized to purchase motor fuel, utilities and road de-icing
salts contrary to the provisions of divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
which require formal bidding and Council approval of all purchases over fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000), provided that at least three written or verbal
quotes are obtained from suppliers or that a bid price is formally established
by another qualified political jurisdiction, such as Montgomery County, the
State of Ohio or other municipality. Utilities are hereby recognized as sole-
source suppliers.
   (l)   Cooperative Purchasing. The Purchasing Agent is hereby authorized to
purchase goods and services in cooperation with the State of Ohio and other
political subdivisions utilizing their bidding procedures. The Purchasing Agent
is further authorized to utilize U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
pricing when making such purchases.
   (m)   Contract Renewals. The Purchasing Agent may approve or submit to
Council for approval, if in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), a
contract previously bid but renewed for another term, if the contractor agrees
to hold his or her price.
   (n)   Waiver. Based upon particular circumstances as determined by Council,
formal bidding procedures may be waived in the event of a sole-source supplier,
a unique or custom piece of equipment, service or technology, a specialty item
or other unusual reason.
   (o)   Northmont City Schools Donations. The Purchasing Agent, at his or her
discretion, shall be permitted to donate obsolete or surplus items, including
computer equipment and peripherals, to Northmont City Schools or the Miami
Valley CTC, for continued public use.
   (p)   The Purchasing Agent, at his or her discretion, shall be permitted to
establish a program to purchase goods and services for the City using a
purchasing card. The limits and controls established in division (c) of this
section, Purchase Orders, shall apply.

Rehabilitation Center for the boarding of prisoners without Council's annual
legislative approval.

public interest will be best served thereby.

   (b)   The Director, as Auditor, may cause a seal to be created for his or
her use.
(Ord. 71-25. Passed 4-13-71.)
236.07 INVESTMENT AND DEPOSITORY POLICY.
   (a)   Policy Statement. It is the policy of the City to deposit and invest
public funds in a manner which will provide the maximum security with the
highest investment return while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the City
and conforming to all applicable local statutes governing the investment of
public funds.
   (b)   Scope.
      (1)   This section applies to all moneys of the City, except for moneys
whose investment and deposit are otherwise controlled by an independent board,
advisory council or trustee under requirements of bond indentures or endowment
trusts (as in the case of certain bond debt service funds, certain debt service
reserve funds and certain nonexpendable trust funds). The City funds subject to
this section are hereinafter referred to as the “active portfolio.”
      (2)   Cash balances from the several different funds of the City may be
pooled for investment purposes. Unless otherwise restricted, all interest
earnings will be credited to the General Fund of the City.
   (c)   Objectives. The following investment and deposit objectives will be
applied in the management of City funds:
      (1)   The primary objective of the City's investment activities is the
preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.
      (2)   All investment and deposit transactions must be in conformance with
all applicable laws and ordinances prevailing at the time of the transaction.
      (3)   The City's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the City to meet operating requirements which might be reasonably
anticipated.
      (4)   In investing public funds, the City will strive to maximize the
return on the portfolio, but will avoid assuming unreasonable investment risks.
      (5)   The City will diversify its investments to avoid incurring
unreasonable and avoidable risks regarding specific security types or
individual financial institutions.
      (6)   Banks vary in the services they provide, their service fees,
interest rates on interim investments and the minimum compensating balances
required for demand-deposit accounts. The City's objective is to obtain good
banking services while minimizing the cost of such services to the City.
   (d)   Prudent Person Standard; Liability.
      (1)   The deposit and investment of City funds shall be made with the
exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income
to be derived (hereinafter referred to as “the prudent person standard”).
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by City officials involved in
the deposit and investment of City funds shall be the prudent person standard
and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. City
officials acting in accordance with written procedures and this section, and
exercising due diligence, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that
deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate
action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (e)   Delegation of Authority; Engaging in Investment Transactions.
      (1)   Authority to manage the City's deposits and investment program is
derived from the City Charter. The City Manager and the Director of Finance, as
Chief Financial Officer of the City, shall be charged with the administration
of this section. The City Manager and the Director of Finance shall have the
right to assign such duties and responsibilities as he or she deems appropriate
in keeping with the efficient and prudent management of this section. Such
assignment shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions.
      (2)   No person may engage in an investment transaction, except as
provided under the terms of this section and the procedures adopted by the
Treasury Investment Board.
   (f)   Conflicts of Interest: Disclosure of Financial Interests by Officers
and Employees.
      (1)   Officers and employees involved in the deposit and investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity which could conflict
with, or have the appearance of a conflict with, the proper execution of the
investment program or which could impair their ability to make impartial
investment decisions.
      (2)   Officers and employees involved in the deposit and investment of
City funds shall disclose to the City's independent auditors any material
financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the
City and, further, disclose any large personal financial/investment positions
that could be related to the performance of the City's portfolio.
      (3)   Officers and employees involved in the investment of City funds
shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the City,
particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales.

in securities maturing more than ten years from the month of settlement. A
security trading on a “when issued” basis may be purchased or sold if all
aspects of the security and the trade meet the requirements of this section and
the settlement date is no longer than thirty days after the trade date.
      (2)   As an alternative, for securities which repay principal prior to
maturity, such as certain mortgage backed securities, the City will not

years. Expected average lives must be substantiated by forecasts independent of
the City and the dealer from which the security is purchased, such as the
Bloomberg System.

Quarterly or a similar rating service selected by the Director of Finance,
which utilizes measures of capital risk, asset quality, margin, earnings and
leverage (CAMEL) to determine the relative strength of financial institutions.
The term “average” shall be defined by the Director of Finance in the absence
of an explicit definition by the rating service.
         B.   To the extent practical, the Director of Finance will minimize
the number of depositories for the efficient, effective and economical deposit
of City funds, and may do so by issuing a formal request for proposal as
frequently as he or she determines necessary. Exceptions to this centralization
of depositories provision will be made when trust agreements or other legal
mandates dictate specific handling or investment requirements that may not be
obtained or most efficiently managed through existing depositories.
         C.   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to enter into the
depository agreements set forth in subsection (n) hereof.

exists a hypothetical mathematical possibility of a negative yield, excluding
default risk, if the security is held to maturity.
   (k)   Diversification.
      (1)   To avoid incurring unreasonable risks inherent in over-investing in
specific instruments, individual financial institutions or maturities, the
Director of Finance will diversify the active portfolio as follows:

      (2)   No transaction needs to be executed when, through inadvertence or
unusual circumstances, a maturity in the active portfolio causes the percentage

authorized financial institutions and dealers within and outside the City. In
the case of a purchase or sale of securities where all other factors are
considered by the Director of Finance to be equal, placement will be made in
favor of the institution situated within the City if two or more offerings or

activities. The report should include at least a summary of the City's
portfolio by institution and types of instruments, average maturity and changes
in portfolio size by fund.

PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Effective December 19, 2005, the full amount of the statutorily
required contributions to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS)
shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in division (b) of this section, and shall be “picked up” (assumed
and paid) by the City. This pick-up by the City is, and shall be, designated as
public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to OPERS by
each person within any of the classes established in division (b). No person
subject to this pick-up shall have the option of choosing to receive the
statutorily required contribution to OPERS directly instead of having it picked
up by the City or of being excluded from the pick-up.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City shall apply to all persons that are:
      (1)   Employees of the City who are, or become, contributing members of
the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System.
      (2)   Elected officials who are, or elect to become, contributing members
of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System.
   (c)   The city’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in OPERS is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for a
salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to OPERS: The total salary
for each employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the City
policies. Such total salary of each employee shall be payable by the City in
two parts: (1) deferred salary, and (2) cash salary. An employee’s deferred
salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee’s total salary which
is required from time to time by OPERS to be paid as an employee contribution
by that employee and shall be paid by the City to OPERS on behalf of that
employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the OPERS employee contribution otherwise
payable by that employee. An employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that
employee’s total salary less the amount of the pick-up for that employee, and
shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to OPERS based upon
an employee’s total salary. The total combined expenditures of the City for
such employees’ total salaries payable under applicable City policies and the
pick-up provisions of this section shall not be greater than the amounts it
would have paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.
   (d)   Police department employees’ contributions.
      (1)   Effective December 19, 2005, the City Council has determined to

department employees who are members of the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund
through a payroll reduction. No contributions, other than police officers’,
prior to the Council’s action, shall be picked up.
      (2)   Said picked-up contributions paid through a payroll reduction, even
though designated as employee contributions for state law purposes, are being
paid by the City in lieu of said contributions by the employee.
      (3)   Said picked-up contributions will not be included in the gross
income of the employees for tax reporting purposes; that is, for federal or
state income tax withholding, until distributed from the Ohio Police and Fire
Pension Fund.
      (4)   Said picked-up contributions will be included in the gross income
of the employees for employment tax purposes, as the contributions are made to
the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund.
      (5)   Said employees shall not be entitled to any option of choosing to
receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the
City to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund.
   (e)   Fire department employees’ contributions.
      (1)   Effective December 19, 2005, the City Council has determined to
begin to pick up all of the mandatory contributions by the fire department
employees who are members of the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund through a
payroll reduction. No contributions prior to the Council’s action shall be
picked up.

citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred

written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted

driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of
the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04 SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

414.07 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   (1)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon or in view of
any highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to
be, is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign
or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic- control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-

also may impose a suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial
driver's license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose

(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section

division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically

milliliter of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma.
            11.   The State Board of Pharmacy has adopted a rule pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 4729.041 that specifies the amount of salvia divinorum and the amount
of salvinorin A that constitute concentrations of salvia divinorum and
salvinorin A in a person’s urine, in a person’s whole blood, or in a person’s
blood serum or plasma at or above which the person is impaired for purposes of
operating any vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley within this State, the
rule is in effect, and the person has a concentration of salvia divinorum or
salvinorin A of at least that amount so specified by rule in the person’s
urine, in the person’s whole blood, or in the person’s blood serum or plasma.
      (2)   No person who, within 20 years of the conduct described in division
(a)(2)A. of this section, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
a violation of this division or a substantially equivalent State law or
municipal ordinance, division (a)(1) of this section or a substantially
equivalent State law or municipal ordinance, or shall do both of the following:
         A.   Operate any vehicle within this Municipality while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them;
         B.   Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle as
described in division (a)(2)A. of this section, being asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and being advised
by the officer in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.192 or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance of the consequences of the person’s refusal or
submission to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)   Underage Alcohol Consumption. No person under 21 years of age shall
operate any vehicle within this Municipality if, at the time of the operation,
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's whole blood;
      (2)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's blood serum or
plasma;
      (3)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02 grams but less than
0.08 grams by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath;
      (4)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.028 grams but less
than 0.11 grams by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's urine.
   (c)   Prosecution; Limitation on Convictions. In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle- related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C.
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician- paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle, in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   "If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle,
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of

lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, "crosswalk" has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).

Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into

driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the municipality
except those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the
vehicle or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Chief of Police or City of Englewood Police Officers, within the
Chiefs respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the Chief of Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer
of such action and of the location of the place of storage, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined
in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Chief of Police, a City of
Englewood Police Officer, or state highway patrol trooper as a result of the
performance of the Chiefs, Police Officer's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Chief
of Police or an Englewood Police Officer of the reasons for leaving the motor
vehicle in such place. However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an
obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into storage immediately unless either
of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

Officer, or state highway patrol trooper shall allow the owner or operator of
the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Chief of Police, a City of Englewood
Police Officer, or state highway patrol trooper. If the Chief of Police, a City
of Englewood Police Officer, or state highway patrol trooper determines that
the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the Chief of
Police, a City of Englewood Police Officer, or state highway patrol trooper
shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Chief of Police or a
City of Englewood Police Officer shall designate the place of storage of any

service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the Chief
of Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer not more than two hours after
the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer shall
cause a search to be made of the records of an applicable entity listed in R.C.

motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Chief of Police, a City of Englewood
Police Officer, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days
of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Chief of
Police or City of Englewood Police Officer shall send or cause to be sent to
the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last known address by
certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail with
electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form of

lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of
if not claimed within ten days of the date of the sending of the notice.

motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Chief of Police, a City of Englewood Police Officer, or a state highway patrol
trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Chief of Police or a City of
Englewood Police Officer, without charge to any party, shall file with the
Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of storage is located an
affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of this section. Upon
presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the
Chief of Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Chief
of Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer shall execute in triplicate an
affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Chief of Police or a
City of Englewood Police Officer shall retain the original of the affidavit for
the Englewood Police Department records, and shall furnish two copies to the
motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of
the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within
30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Chief of
Police or a City of Englewood Police Officer of the reason for leaving the
motor vehicle in such place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing of
such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the municipality
from such disposal.

adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the

         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:

private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall

unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under

recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B.   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning all of the
following:
            1.   The vehicle's license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be

removed from private property in the Police Chief's jurisdiction that is
established as a private tow-away zone of which the Police Chief has received
notice under this division (h). The record shall include all information
submitted by the towing service. The Police Chief shall provide any information

person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator,
or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information pertaining to the
vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner's and lienholder's last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form

            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not

division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:

under authority of division (h)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any

606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an

   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.

606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.

offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

R.C. 2923.01;

   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.

offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

harassing of such occupants; that without resort to such practice full
opportunity exists, and under the terms and provisions of this section will
continue to exist, for the exercise of freedom of speech and other

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

   (Editor's note: Section 642.23 was repealed as part of the 1985 updating and

law (Ohio R.C. 4933.42 and 4933.99(A)) was repealed by the Ohio General
Assembly by Sub. S.B. No.183, effective September 26, 1984. See Sections
642.01(a), (v) and
642.02.)
642.24 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.25 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09(a)(1) or (b)(1):
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the court.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County’s General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider

      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.  (REPEALED)
   ( Editor's note: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating

violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

   (b)   Determination of Net Profits. The portion of the entire net profits of
a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the Municipality,

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality, to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing
allocation formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis may,
under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.
      (2)   As used in division (b)(1)C. of this section, "sales made in the
Municipality" means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Municipality, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered

within the Municipality, and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion;
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Municipality, to purchasers outside the Municipality,

the place where delivery is made.
   (c)   Determination of Taxable Base. For the purpose of this section, the

      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Superintendent of
Taxation.

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,

a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the
Municipality, constituting a portion only of his or her total business, the
Superintendent may require such additional information as he or she deems
necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the
Municipality. If the Superintendent finds net profits are not properly
allocated to the Municipality, by reason of transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates
or transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he
or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits
to the Municipality.

similar payments including disability benefits received from local, State or

(Ord. 674. Passed 11-13-70; Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-14-10; Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-

880.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person who engages in business or other activity or whose
salary, wage, commission or other compensation is subject to the tax provided
for in this chapter shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a
return on or before April 15 of the following year. When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed within three and one-half months from the end of such fiscal
year or period. The Superintendent is hereby authorized to provide, by
regulation, that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of
tax deducted by said employer or employers from the salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation of an employee, and paid by him, her, it or
them to the Superintendent, may be accepted as the return required of any
employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such
salaries, wages, commission or other compensation. Every resident shall make
and file a Municipal income tax return on or before April 15 for the previous
calendar year, except as follows:
      (1)   Residents under the age of eighteen years;
      (2)   After the filing of returns for the tax year 1992, and review of
the information contained therein, the Superintendent or his or her designated
agent may exempt from filing those individuals who reported income from non-
taxable sources when it appears that this is and will continue to be their only
income source. This will include retirees, totally disabled and active duty
military personnel.
(Ord. 93-2. Passed 1-12-93.)
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Superintendent on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Superintendent setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation received by him or her and gross income from a business,
profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject
to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Superintendent may require.
   (c)   The Superintendent may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return. A copy of a Federal
extension request for the taxable period for which an extension is requested
shall be considered a request for extension under this section, providing it is
filed with the Superintendent on or before the date the City return is
required. A timely filed request for extension of time to file shall be granted
unless the taxpayer owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax or any
penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax return,
report, or other related document for a prior tax period. The granting of an
extension of time for filing the return does not extend the last date for
paying the tax without penalty and interest. The Superintendent may require a
tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due
thereon by the date the return is normally due.
   (d)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Superintendent the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,
provided, however, that credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which has been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.06;
         B.   Any portion of the tax which has been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
880.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
880.11, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall
be refunded.
   (e)   (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
880.11. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable upon request from
the Superintendent. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return
without the approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Municipality return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (f)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. However, the taxpayer shall have ten days after
notification by the Superintendent, or his or her authorized representative, to
file the items required by this division.
   (g)   The Superintendent shall accept a generic form of any return, report,
or document required to be filed if the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the Municipality governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.

880.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer shall, at the time of the payment of any salary,
wage, commission or other compensation, deduct the tax of one and three-
quarters percent beginning December 1, 1978, and such additional amounts as may
be imposed by ordinance, of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation due by the employer to his or her employees who are subject to the
provisions of this chapter. In making such deductions at the time of payment,
the employer shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so that mills of
five or more shall be increased to the next full cent and mills less than five
shall be dropped. No person shall be entitled to a refund merely because such
rounding off of the tax results in an apparent overpayment based on his or her
total earnings. Each employer shall, on or before the last day of each month,
make a return and pay to the Superintendent of Taxation the tax withheld during
the preceding month. However, the Superintendent shall have the authority to
approve the filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld on a quarterly
basis. In such case, the employer shall, on or before the last day of each
month following the calendar quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30
and December 31, make a return and pay to the Superintendent the tax withheld
during the preceding calendar quarter. Such approval for quarterly filings and
payments may be withdrawn by the Superintendent when it is to the best
interests of the Municipality to do so. The Superintendent shall provide by
regulation the manner in which such approval is to be granted or withdrawn. The
Superintendent may, by regulation, provide for semiannual filing where monthly
or quarterly payments are made electronically.
(Ord. 90-30. Passed 10-23-90.)
      (2)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Each employer, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee
for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by each
employer from his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the
Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of each employer.
   (c)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person's residence, even though such residence is in the
Municipality, but such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of
this chapter.
(Ord. 78-47. Passed 7-18-78.)
   (d)   On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return on a form prescribed by and obtainable upon request from the
Superintendent, setting forth the names and addresses of all employees from
whose compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year and
the amount of tax withheld from his or her employees and such other information
as may be required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Superintendent.
The Superintendent may, by regulation, provide for mandatory use of electronic
media by employers employing in excess of 100 employees for the reporting of
annual wage and tax data.
(Ord. 90-30. Passed 10-23-90; Ord. 93-2. Passed 1-12-93.)
   (e)   It shall be the responsibility of any person, as defined in Section
880.02, who is required to withhold the tax from wages of its employees under
this section, to see that all such taxes so withheld are paid to the
Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In the event
taxes withheld from the salaries of employees are not paid to the Municipality
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the person shall be
criminally liable under the provisions of Sections 880.12 and 880.99.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-14-10; Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
880.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates the receipt of any taxable income which
is not subject to Section
880.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person's estimated taxable
income together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any, provided, however,
that if a person's income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be
withheld and remitted to the Municipality in accordance with Section
880.06, or the tax due is one hundred dollars ($100.00) or less, such person
need not file a declaration.
(Ord. 84-13. Passed 7-10-84.)
   (b)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each
year during the life of this chapter, or within four months after the date the

         the estimated tax due. In accordance with the provisions of Section
880.15, credit may be taken for tax to be paid or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may
be amended at any time. (Ord. 674. Passed 10-13-70.)
      (3)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of the
following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year, on or before the
date fixed by regulation of the Superintendent if it appears that the original
declaration made for such taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
ten percent or more. At such time a payment which together with prior payments
is sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated liability shall be made.
If upon the filing of the return required by Section
880.05, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent of his or her
tax liability, as shown on such return, on or before January 31 or the date
fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable, the difference between ninety
percent of such taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of estimated tax
actually paid on or before January 31 or the date fixed by regulation,
whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of Section
880.10. (Ord. 90-30. Passed 10-23-90.)
   (d)   (1)   Such declaration of net estimated tax to be paid the
Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the
estimated annual tax less credit, and at least a similar amount shall be paid

beginning of the taxable year. However, in case an amended declaration has been
filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments
on or before the remaining payment dates.

taxpayer files his final return and pays the balance of the tax due thereon
within forty-five days following the end of the taxable year.
   (e)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration
was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which is due the
Municipality shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of
Section
880.05.

      (1)   General provisions.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that any taxpayer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has a tax liability for which he or she has filed a

civil suit. Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent or
more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due
or filed, whichever is later. However, in those cases in which the Commissioner

qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.

      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the Municipality
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in the
Municipality, the exception from withholding requirements described in division

which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in the Municipality.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Municipality
under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Municipality for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the Municipality are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   2016 Replacement
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding
the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
881.051.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in the Municipality, an employer is not required to withhold
Municipal income tax on the qualifying wages of such a person if the person
performs those services on twelve or fewer days in a calendar year, unless the
principal place of work of the employer is located in another municipal
corporation in this State that imposes a tax applying to compensation paid to
the person for services performed on those days and the person is not liable to
that other municipal corporation for tax on the compensation paid for such
services. For the purposes of this division, a petroleum refinery is a facility
with a standard industrial classification code facility classification of 2911,
petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a).
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a).

affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division (e) to the Municipality.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident shall report the individual's net
profit from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for
the Municipality. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual
paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the extent that
such credit is allowed under Section
881.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
881.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by the Municipality, and if the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit to the Municipality, then the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit
that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division (g) applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.

R.C. 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
Municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in

      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to the
tax established by this chapter.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five year
period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the tax administrator for the

   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a

881.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
881.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter on
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (i)   Alternative net profits apportionment for net profits with remote
employees of R.C. § 718.821.
      (1)   Terms used in this section have the same meanings as in R.C. §
718.021.
      (2)   A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this section to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of R.C. § 718.82 apply to such
apportionment except as otherwise provided in this section. A taxpayer shall
make the election allowed under this section by notifying the tax administrator
in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a
timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an
assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election. After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the
election applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts
business. Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this section after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of R.C. § 718.82, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (i)(2) of this section:
         A.   For the purpose of division (A)(l) of R.C. § 718.82, the average
original cost of any tangible persona1 property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of R.C. § 718.82, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of R.C. § 718.82, and
notwithstanding division (D) of that section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or the
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of R.C. § 718.82, However, the tax administrator
shall require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would cause a taxpayer to incur tax liability in a municipal corporation solely
because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this
section is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to R.C. §§ 718.011 and 718.03.

($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts

amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
881.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due

         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
881.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section
881.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

881.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
881.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to a Municipal income
tax in another municipality, he or she shall not pay a total Municipal income
tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the highest rate to
which he or she is subject.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality, who
receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, if it appears that he or she has paid a municipal income tax on
the same income taxable under this chapter by another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid
by him or her or in his or her behalf to such other municipality. The credit
shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such
other municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid. The amount of
income reported on Federal schedule C, E and F, earned in and taxed by a given
municipality shall be used to determine each municipality's contribution to net
Municipality taxable income, prior to calculation of the resident city credit
for taxes paid to other cities on net profit income. The rate to be used for
calculation of this credit shall be the lesser of the resident city tax rate or
the appropriate rate at which such income was taxed by such other municipality.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:

described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Municipality with respect to
any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax established by this chapter for
each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The
amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and
the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
881.081.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by the Municipality. The Department of Taxation is expected to
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
Department will transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax established by this chapter, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
881.092, the provision in Section
881.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to Section
881.091(h)(1) shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return
under Section
881.091(f)(3) and (f)(4).
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payments shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the
taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be
the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
881.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
881.052.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal
taxable income on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

881.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (a)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, the
Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file its Municipal
income tax return or estimated Municipal income tax return or extension for
filing a Municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of Municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by the Municipality, taxpayers,
or other persons does not affect the legal rights of the Municipality or
taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a party
to the administration of Municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a Municipal
income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of the Municipality to administer, audit, and enforce the provisions
of its Municipal income tax.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a Municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
   (f)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first. This section does not apply to an extension received under division (b)
of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer
failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension
under division (b) of this section or failed to file for an extension under
division (b) of this section.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15; Ord. 23-16. Passed 11-28-23.)
881.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional Municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
881.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (a)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
881.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.096 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other Municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
881.10(a).
   (e)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
881.10.

      (3)   With respect to any unpaid withholding tax, a penalty equal to
fifty percent of the amount not timely paid shall be imposed.
      (4)   For tax years prior to December 31, 2022, with respect to returns
other than estimated income tax returns, the Municipality shall impose a
monthly penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each failure to timely file
each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon for each month, or any
fraction thereof, during which the return remains unfiled regardless of the
liability shown thereon. The penalty shall not exceed a total of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) in assessed penalty for each failure to timely file a
return.
      (5)   For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, with respect to

regardless of the liability shown thereon, except that municipality shall abate
or refund the penalty assessed on a taxpayer's first failure to timely file a
return after the taxpayer files that return.
   (d)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not impose, seek to collect, or
collect any penalty, amount of interest, charges or additional fees not
described in this Section
881.10.

collected before January 1, 2016.

881.11 AUDIT.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
881.03(c)(3), the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer a written
description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer during an
audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a
refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the
Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to
have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($.50) shall be
dropped, rounding down to the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to
round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered
on the document.

the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (h)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

   (i)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the tax established by this
chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's Social Security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
881.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 for a violation of Section
881.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
State law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective Municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
881.15.
   (e)   If the Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds the Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such Board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-17. Passed 11-10-15.)
881.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
881.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

884.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)   "Director of Finance" means the Director of Finance of the City.
   (c)   "Hotel" or "motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in
one or several structures.
   (d)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
property and services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which the
occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)   "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel or
motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in
possession or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her
functions through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an
employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of
this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance
by both.
   (g)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession, of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof in any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space,
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or
possess, all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.02 RATE OF TAX.
   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of the
City, for the use of the General Fund of the City, there is hereby levied a
tax, to be known as the "Hotel-Motel Tax," of three percent on all rents
received by a hotel or motel for lodging furnished to transient guests.
   The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City, which
debt is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.
   The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or motel
at the time tie rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportional share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guests ceasing to occupy space in the hotel
or motel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel or motel, the Director of Finance may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to him or her.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.03 EXEMPTIONS.

   (b)   No exemption claimed under subsection (a) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and, under
penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance. All
claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Director.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.04 PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter or present to the operator false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.05 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from the rent
and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the occupancy is
arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy or
any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or delivered by
the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as
trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be liable for
the collection thereof .and for the tax.
   No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.06 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 73-

whichever is later, each operator of any hotel or motel renting lodging to
transient guests shall register such hotel or motel with the Director of
Finance and obtain from him or her a "Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
The Certificate shall, inter alia, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel or motel;
   (c)   The date upon which the Certificate was issued; and
   (d)   "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Hotel-
Motel Tax ordinance by registering with the Director of Finance of the City of
Englewood for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Hotel-Motel
Tax and remitting said tax to the Director of Finance. This certificate does
not constitute a permit. "
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.07 RECORDS.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance and

established by the Director of Finance, make a return to the Director, on forms
provided by the Director, of the total rents charged and received and the
amount of Hotel-Motel Tax collected during the reporting period as established
by the Director. All claims for exemption from the tax filed by occupants with
the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the
time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be
remitted to the Director. The Director may establish longer or shorter
reporting periods for any Certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in
order to ensure collection of the tax and he or she may require further
information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax. Returns and payment are due immediately upon cessation of business for
any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be
held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the
Director. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
confidential and shall not be released by the Director except upon order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States,
the State, the County or the City for official use only.
(Ord. 73-41. Passed 11-27-73.)
884.09 FEES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Late Fee. If any operator fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required, a late fee of fifteen percent shall be added
to the delinquent tax.
   (b)   Fraud Penalty. If the Director of Finance determines that the
nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty
equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalty stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Attorneys' Fees. If any operator fails to remit any sum imposed by
this chapter within the time required, the operator shall be responsible for
all attorneys' fees incurred in the collection of such sum, whether or not a
civil action for collection is brought by the City.
   (d)   Interest. If any operator fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required, such tax shall bear interest at the per annum
rate determined pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5703.47.

completed within the specified time, Council shall authorize the construction
and/or repair of such improvements and assess the cost of the improvements to
the abutting property owner.

remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation
after the term of a certificate of registration, including, but not limited to,
damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate of
registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise of
the City's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the
latter.

1026.20 INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES BY CITY.
   As part of City required standards wherever rights-of-way are under
construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the City Manager, the City

needs. Any such installed facilities shall be City property and may be conveyed
to any person under such terms and conditions as are deemed advisable by the
City Manager.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
1026.21 CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Application.
      (1)   Unless exempted under this chapter, a valid certificate of
registration shall be required for each utility service provider with any
element of a utility system located in a public right-of-way in the City.
      (2)   The utility service provider shall apply to the City Manager for a
certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration.
The City Manager shall determine the form of the application. An application
shall include the following information and fee:
         A.   Detailed identification information about the utility service
provider; a copy of the current incorporation certificate of the applicant, if
applicable; both regular and emergency contact information for the utility
service provider; a brief description of each utility service provided or
proposed to be provided; a copy of each approval required by law, by any
applicable authority, to provide any utility service described in the
application; evidence of reasonable insurance coverage by the utility service
provider; and any other relevant information the City Manager deems necessary
to determine the fitness of the utility service provider.
         B.   If requested by the City Manager or the applicant, the applicant
utility service provider and the City must meet to coordinate future plans for
the public right-of-way between the utility service provider and the City.
         C.   An application fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be
paid to the City at the time an application for a certificate of registration
is filed with the City. No part of an application fee is returnable to the
applicant.
   (b)   Decision by Council. Unless the applicant agrees to an extension of
the maximum decision time, the City shall have a maximum time period of ninety
(90) consecutive calendar days from the date a complete application for a
certificate of registration by a utility service provider is received by the
City to make a decision on the application. Unless the applicant agrees to an
extension of the maximum decision time, failure of the City to make a decision
on an application for a certificate of registration shall be considered the
same as an approval of the application by the City.
   (c)   Criteria for Issuance. In deciding whether to issue a certificate of
registration, the City Manager shall consider: whether the issuance of the
certificate of registration will contribute to the health, safety, and welfare
of the City and its citizens; whether the issuance of the certificate of
registration will be consistent with this chapter; whether the applicant has
submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other
authorizations required by law in order to construct and operate a system in
the manner proposed by the applicant; whether the applicant is delinquent on
any taxes or other obligations owed to the City, to Montgomery County, Ohio, or
to the State of Ohio; whether the applicant has the requisite financial,
managerial, and technical ability to fulfill all the obligations under this
chapter and the issuance of a certificate of registration; and any other
applicable law.
   (d)   Denial of Application. The City Manager shall have right to deny an
application for a certificate of registration for adequate cause. If requested
in writing by the applicant, the City Manager must provide to the applicant in
written form specific factual findings in support of the decision by the City
Manager to deny the application for a certificate of registration. Any decision
by the City Manager to deny an application for a certificate of registration is
appealable by the applicant to the City Council in the manner set forth in
Section
1026.25.
   (e)   Expiration of Certificate. Unless terminated by the City at an earlier
date, a certificate of registration shall expire one year from the date of
issuance by the City.
   (f)   Responsibilities of Provider.
      (1)   When required by these Codified Ordinances, a utility service
provider with a valid certificate of registration must obtain a revocable
street privilege permit.
      (2)   The provider must keep all the information required in the
application by the City current.
      (3)   When requested by the City, a public or private utility service
provider, with a utility system element located or proposed to be located in a
public right-of-way in the City, must meet with the City to coordinate future
plans for the public right-of-way between the utility service provider and the
City.
      (4)   A utility service provider with any utility system element located
or proposed to be located in a right-of-way in the City must provide the City
with up-to-date accurate plans in sufficient detail and in a format acceptable
to the City showing the location of all elements of the utility system located
in the right-of-way in the City.
      (5)   In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall
obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
Federal, State and local authorities and, upon the City's reasonable request,
shall provide copies of such documents to the City.
      (6)   A certificate of registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable,
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the City or under the management and control of
another utility provider that is legally occupying the city right-of-way.
   (g)   Limitations on Rights of Provider. A certificate of registration shall
not convey equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of
registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in
the City for the limited purpose and for the limited period stated in the
certificate of registration and in accordance with this chapter and any
associated permit. For those providers with a valid gas or electric franchise,
the provisions of a certificate of registration shall be deemed regulatory in
nature and shall not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights-of-
way which may have been granted by such franchise. The rights to occupy the
right-of-way itself may not be subdivided or subleased, provided, however, that
two or more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-
of-way so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this
chapter. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws.
   (h)   Relocation of Equipment.
      (1)   A provider must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard
for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment
and facilities in the right-of-way whenever the City Manager requests such
removal and relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way to the same
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The City Manager may
make such request to prevent interference by the company's equipment or
facilities with:
         A.   A present or future City use of the right-of-way,
         B.   A public improvement undertaken by the City,
         C.   An economic development project in which the City has an interest
or investment,
         D.   When the public health, safety and welfare require it, or
         E.   When necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person shall be required to
remove or relocate its equipment from any right-of-way which has been vacated
in favor of a non-city entity unless and until the reasonable costs thereof are
first paid to the person therefor.
   (i)   Location of Equipment Prior to Excavation. Before the start date of
any right-of-way excavation, each provider who has equipment in the area to be
excavated shall contact the Ohio Utilities Protection Service (OUPS) and shall
mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all said equipment.
Any provider whose equipment is estimated to be less than twenty inches below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its equipment and the best
procedure for excavation.
   (j)   Work by City in Right-of-way. Removal of Provider's Equipment: Damage
to Equipment in Right-of-way; Costs.
      (1)   When the City does or causes to be done work in the right-of-way
and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's equipment to
protect it, the City Manager shall notify the provider's local representative
as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be
billed to that provider and must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date
of billing.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the right-of-way which it or its equipment damages. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of
another provider caused during the City's response to an emergency occasioned
by that provider's equipment.
   (k)   Vacating of Right-of-Way.
      (1)   If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the equipment of
a provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the
provider's equipment, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all
providers having equipment in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install,
maintain and operate any equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter
upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing,
inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
      (2)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's
equipment, and
         A.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the
provider must pay the relocation costs; or
         B.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the
provider must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City
and the provider; or
         C.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the provider, such other person or persons must pay the relocation
costs.
   (l)   Discontinued Operations; Abandoned Equipment.
      (1)   A provider who has determined to discontinue its operations in the
City must either:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the City Manager that the
provider's obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this chapter
have been lawfully assumed by another provider; or
         B.   Submit to the City Manager a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this paragraph, the City may, at its option, purchase the equipment;
require the provider, at its own expense, to remove it; or require the provider
to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably
anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.
      (2)   The equipment of a provider who fails to comply with the
discontinued operations provisions of this chapter and which remains unused
shall be deemed to be abandoned. Unused equipment means facilities located in
the rights-of-way which have remained unused for a period of two years and for
which the provider is unable to:
         A.   Provide the City with a credible plan detailing the procedure by
which the provider intends to begin actively using such facilities within the
next twelve months; or
         B.   That it has a potential purchaser or user of the facilities who
will be actively using the facilities within the next twelve months; or
         C.   That the availability of such facilities is required by the
provider to adequately and efficiently operate its system. Abandoned equipment
is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has
at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
            1.   Abating the nuisance;
            2.   Taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a
useable condition; or
            3.    Requiring removal of the equipment by the provider, or the
provider's successor in interest.
      (3)   Any provider who has unused and abandoned equipment in any right-
of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled
excavation, or at such different time as designated by the City Manager, unless
this requirement is waived by the City Manager.
      (4)   In the event of any conflict with the provisions of this subsection
with those provisions of federal law known as the Miller Act, the provisions of
the Miller Act shall control.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
   1026.22 TERMINATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Written Notice of Violation.The City Manager shall give written notice
of violation to a provider if it is determined that a provider has violated any
material provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a
certificate of registration or any law of the City, State, or Federal
government; attempted to evade any provision or requirement of the issuance of
a certificate of registration or the acceptance of it; practiced any fraud or
deceit upon the City; or made a material misrepresentation of fact in its
application for a certificate of registration.
   (b)   Failure to Cure Violation. If a provider fails to cure a violation
within thirty calendar days after a violation notice is served by the City,
then such violation shall be a material breach and the City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the certificate of
registration. If the City Manager decides there is cause or reason to
terminate, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The City shall serve the provider with a written notice of the
reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow the provider a minimum
of ten calendar days to cure its breach.
      (2)   If the provider fails to cure within ten calendar days, the City
Manager may declare the certificate of registration terminated.
      (3)   The determination of the City Manager shall be final.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
1026.23 REVOCABLE STREET PRIVILEGE PERMITS.
   (a)   Application. An application for a revocable street privilege permit
shall be in accordance with Section
1026.21, including any additional requirements contained in this chapter.
   (b)   Requirements. The requirements in this section shall be in addition to
any requirement set forth in Section
1026.21, et seq.
      (1)   A utility service provider must have a valid certificate of
registration on file with the City, or be exempt under Section
1026.09, before the City may issue a revocable street privilege permit.
      (2)   When practical, in the opinion of the City, the policy of the City
is to require the underground location of a new utility system element in the
public right-of-way.
      (3)   The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a utility
system in a public right-of-way by a utility service provider must be
accomplished in a practical manner which, in the opinion of the City, results
in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public right-of-
way.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a specific timetable for the permit
work to be accomplished within, detailed plans, accurate scale drawings, and
specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the City to describe the area
of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the City may require
the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate, comprehensive master plans of
the existing and proposed utility system. These master plans are intended to
allow the City to consider the broader context of the utility service
provider's plans upon which the permit application is based.
   (c)   Limitation on Placement of New System or Additional Elements: Denial
of Permit.
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in recognition of
the limitation of space in the public right-of-way, the City Manager shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of a new utility system or
additional elements of an existing utility system within a public right-of-way
if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to
occupy and use the public right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City
Manager shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the public right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public's need for the particular
utility service, the condition of the public right-of-way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing elements of
utility systems in the public right-of-way, and future City plans for public
improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.
      (2)   The City Manager may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the public right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the
public right-of-way and its users. The City Manager, in his or her discretion,
may consider one of more of the following factors: the extent to which public
right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; the competing
demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; the availability of other
locations in the public right-of-way or in other public rights-of-way for the
utility system elements of the permit applicant; the applicability of
ordinances or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect the location of
utility system elements in the right-of-way; the degree of compliance of the
applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and
other applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to
surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that
part of the public right-of-way; the condition and age of the public right-of-
way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction;
the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the public
right-of-way against the benefits to that part of the public served by the
expansion into additional parts of the public right-of-way; and the feasibility
of accomplishing the desired goal outside of the public right-of-way.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
1026.24 NONLIABILITY OF CITY; INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   By reason of the acceptance of an application or the grant of a
permit, the City does not assume any liability for injuries to persons, damage
to property, or loss of service claims, or for claims or penalties of any sort
resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of
facilities.
   (b)   By applying for and being issued a certificate of registration with
the City, a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a provider is required
and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a permit, excepting only negligent acts or omissions that are willful and
wanton or intentional torts and for which immunity is not provided by the Ohio
Revised Code for such acts, omissions, or intentional torts. This exception
shall not extend to acts, omissions, or intentional torts occurring as a result
of or in response to an emergency. A provider further agrees that it will not
bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming
damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors or any claim nor
for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or
operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-
way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider or to the City, and
the provider, in defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by
law, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that
the City could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercises of the above
shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, each provider shall, at its
sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including, without limitation,
worker's compensation claims against the City or others), causes of action,
liability, and judgments for injury or damages, including, but not limited to,
expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the City
related to the following:
         A.   Injuries or damage to persons or property, in any way arising out
of or through the acts or omissions of the provider, its subcontractors, agents
or employees attributable to the occupation by the provider of the right-of-
way, to which the provider's negligence shall in any way contribute, and
regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other
party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury
or damage.
         B.   Any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of
person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright,
trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right of any person,
firm and corporation by the provider, by excluding claims arising out of or
related to City programming.
         C.   The provider's failure to comply with the provisions of any law
applicable to the provider.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving the provider reasonable notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the provider the opportunity to fully participate in
any discussions concerning any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or
disposition of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification, as well as
the sole right to approve any compromise or settlement or financial commitment,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel, if employed.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
1026.25 APPEALS.
   (a)   Authorization.The following decisions of the City Manager pursuant to
this chapter are appealable to the City Council:

      (2)   The denial of an application for a certificate of registration
under Section
1026.21(d); and
      (3)   Denial of a permit under Section

one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (c)   Time Limitation. Appeals to the City Council shall be filed within
thirty days from the decision of the City Manager by filing a written notice of
appeal with the Clerk of the City Council. The notice of appeal shall specify
the grounds for such appeal, and shall be on the form prescribed by the Clerk
of the City Council. Upon receipt of an appropriately completed notice of
appeal and filing fee, the Clerk of the City Council shall transmit to the
members of the City Council all papers constituting the record upon which the
decisions being appealed were based.
   (d)   Hearing. The City Council shall schedule the hearing for the appeal
within a reasonable period of time at a regularly-scheduled City Council
meeting. Written notice of the hearing shall be sent to the aggrieved provider
at least ten days prior to the hearing. The failure of delivery of such notice,
however, shall not invalidate any subsequent proceedings. The aggrieved
provider or its representative may appear and be heard at the hearing, and
present any evidence the provider desires in support of its position.
   (e)   Decision. The City Council may affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or
in part, the decision appealed from, and to that end, the City Council shall
have all the powers of the City Manager with respect to such decision. The
concurring vote of a majority of the members of the City Council shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision of the City Manager under this
chapter. The City Council shall render a written decision on the appeal without
unreasonable delay after the close of the hearing, and in all cases within
thirty days after the close of the hearing.
   (f)   Records. The Clerk of the City Council shall maintain complete records
of all actions of the City Council with respect to appeals.

1026.26 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or any portions of this chapter are illegal or
unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist
hereunder shall be considered as a revocable street privilege permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty days
written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable street privilege permit shall be the same requirements and conditions
as set forth in the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for
conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If
a permit or right shall be considered a revocable street privilege permit as
provided herein, the provider must acknowledge the authority of the City to
issue such permit and the power to revoke it.
(Ord. 00-10. Passed 7-11-00.)
1026.99 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful to violate any provision of this chapter.
Violation of any provision of this chapter, or failure to comply with any
requirement of this chapter (including a violation of a condition or safeguard
established in connection with a certificate of registration, permit, or any
other City approval), shall constitute a misdemeanor of the second degree. Each
and every failure to comply shall be considered a distinct and separate
offense. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a distinct and
separate offense.
   (b)   The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive or in lieu of
other rights and remedies that the City may have. The City is hereby authorized
at any time to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury
to the rights-of-way, including damage to the rights-of-way, whether caused by
a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of
applicable law.
   (c)   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter, and the
remedy of specific performance which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the City Manager may assess an additional penalty of civil
forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Said
penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the City, in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per twenty-four-hour day of violation and any
subsequent portion of a day less than twenty four hours in length. Prior to
assessing said penalty, the City Manager shall provide written notice to the
provider detailing the failure to comply with a specific provision of this
chapter. Said notice shall indicate that said penalty shall be assessed in
fifteen calendar days after service of the notice if compliance is not
achieved. If a provider desires to challenge said penalty, the provider shall
request a hearing before the City Manager within ten days of service of the
notice. Said hearing shall be held within thirty days of the provider's
request. If the provider requests such hearing before the City Manager, said
penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the hearing, the
City Manager determines that the provider failed to comply with the specific
provision of this chapter referenced in the notice, said penalty shall be
assessed starting fifteen calendar days after service of the notice referenced
in this subsection and continuing for each day thereafter until compliance is
achieved. The determination of the City Manager shall be final.

      (1)   In accordance with R.C. § 4939.0314(D) the City shall reserve the
right to propose an alternate location to the proposed location of a new
wireless support structure, provided the alternate location is within 100 feet
or a distance equal to the width of the right-of- way in or on which the new
wireless support structure is proposed, whichever is greater. The City also
finds that certain locations and collocation configurations are preferred. A
preferred location and collocation configuration should be utilized whenever
possible and should only be surpassed if in the determination of the Public
Works Director or the Public Works Director designee, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         D.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         E.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless

City right-of -way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the right-of -way. If no such existing pole is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
         H.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         I.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City right-of-way.
      (2)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 1,000
feet from any existing small cell facility.
   (c)   Wireless facilities design shall be as follows:
      (1)   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards:
         A.   Wireless support structures shall be limited to forty feet in
height.
         B.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.

elements:
            1.   Material - aluminum poles;
            2.   Color - black anodized;
            3.   Diameter - twelve inches;
            4.   Style - smooth round tapered profile;
            5.   Base - trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier;
            6.   Exception - if the neighborhood context would be better served
by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined by the
Public Works Director or his/her designee, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be based
on the following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district or specific site; and
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
      (2)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.   The City reserves the right to require antenna and all associated
equipment shall be concealed to the extent deemed necessary by the Public Works
Director in response to the aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some
possible configurations include but shall not be limited to the following:
            1.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Public
Works Director or the Public Works Director designee may approve a side-mounted
antenna with the initial fitting if, in the Public Works Director's or the
Public Works Director designee's discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be
a better match to the built aesthetics and character, of the immediate area and
would promote the purposes of this chapter.
            2.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above the
radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
         C.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna and
as identified by R.C. § 4939.01(P)(2), shall not exceed twenty-eight cubic feet
in volume per facility.
         D.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small sell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
            1.   Not exceed twenty-one cubic feet in volume;
            2.   Not exceed ninety inches in height, twenty inches in width, or
twenty inches in depth;
            3.   Not extend more than twenty-four inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
            4.   Be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which it is
mounted;
            5.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure; and
            6.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.
         E.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design elements:
            1.   Material. The enclosure material shall be metal, a composite,
or an equivalent material as determined by the Public Works Director or the
Public Works Director designee.
            2.   Color. The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            3.   Style. The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            4.   Coordinated design elements. Common enclosures shall match the
material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
               a.   Such enclosures are located within 5,000 feet of an
existing common enclosure; and
               b.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support structures
of a similar or matching design.
            5.   Exception. If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area are better matched by an enclosure of different materials, color, style,
or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure, as
determined by the Public Works Director or his/her designee, then such design
elements may be substituted with an alternate design element. Such
determination shall be based on the following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district or specific area; and
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from view.
         F.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Public Works Director or the Public Works Director designee:
            1.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence that
the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground vault,
or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element (i.e. - bus
stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration. If a ground
mounted enclosure is approved, the Public Works Director or the Public Works
Director designee shall reserve the right to require any of the following
conditions:
               a.   Concealed enclosure. All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Public Works Director or his/her designee.
               b.   Smallest size. The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Public Works Director or the Public Works Director designee.
               c.   Camouflage. Camouflaging elements may be required. Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            2.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be thirty
inches.

transportation uses in the right-of-way or on a wireless support structure or
pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved plan in place
at the time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall not preclude
placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility. If replacement of
the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to accommodate the
collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the small cell
facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or wireless support
structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure must accommodate
the future use.

tenant, occupant or lessee receive the statements and pay charges for water and
sewer service but such occupant, tenant or lessee for such purpose acts as the
agent of the owner who shall not thereby be relieved from the payment of any
charges not paid by the tenant, occupant or lessee.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71.)
1040.08 BILLS TO BE MAILED; PAYMENT.
   Statements of charges for water, sewer and other services shall be deposited
postage paid by the Director of Finance with the United States Postal Service
for delivery only as a matter of convenience to the owner or consumer and
failure of the owner or consumer to receive statements does not relieve the
owner or consumer of his or her obligation to pay such statements.
   All charges for service provided by the Division of Utilities shall be paid
to the City at the Municipal Building.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71.)
1040.09 METER READING; ESTIMATES.
   Water meters shall be read three times each year or at such times for such
areas within the City as the Director of Finance from time to time determines.
Owners or consumers may be charged for sewer and water service at an estimated
rate of consumption, taking prior meter readings as a guide, at any time that
water meters are not read.
   The Director shall, whenever possible, determine the amount of water
delivered to the owner or consumer by reading the water meter and shall prepare
the water and sewer service statements based on such readings. The Director
may, however, estimate the amount of water delivered since the prior meter
reading, taking the prior meter readings as a guide, if weather conditions,
meter inaccuracy, inaccessibility of the meter, accounting system requirements
or other conditions require. The Director shall determine, and his or her
determination shall be final, the amount of water delivered, either by estimate
of water meter readings or by actual meter readings, and the owner or consumer
shall pay to the City the amount charged based on the Director's computation or
estimate of water delivered.
   The Director shall calculate charges for water and sewer service based on
water usage rounded off to the nearest 1, 000 gallon increment.
(Ord. 72-23. Passed 5-23-72.)
1040.10 REBATES AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   No rebate, deduction or adjustment shall be made of water charges to any
owner or consumer because of leakage or alleged leakage in any water pipe, tank
or other device or because of water wasted through continuously open faucets.
The Director of Finance shall, when requested by the owner or consumer, reduce
the charge for sewer service by an amount equal to the charge for sewer service
for seventy-five percent of the water wasted and not discharged into the sewer
system when the Director verifies that a water service or inside plumbing line,
not including fixture or fixture parts, has broken, leaked and caused
excessively high water usage to record on the owner's or consumer's water
meter.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71.)
   1040.11 LIMITATION ON WATER USE OR SEWER SYSTEM DISCHARGE.
   No consumer shall draw water from the water system in amounts in excess of
what can be provided by the water system without limitation of or restriction
of other consumers' use.
   No consumer shall discharge sewage into the sewer system in amounts in
excess of what can be drained and treated by the sewer system without
limitation of or restriction of other consumers' discharge.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71.)
1040.12 CONNECTION PERMITS; RENEWAL FEES.
   A permit for connection to the water or sewer system, when issued by the
Director of Finance, shall be valid for the property for which application was
made, provided, however, that such connection shall be made within six months
from the date of issuance. If such connection is not made within six months,
the property owner shall apply to the Department of Finance within thirty days
of the expiration of the permit for renewal of the connection permit. Such
permit renewal shall be issued by the Director, provided that the owner pays to
the City a fee for renewal of the permit in the amount of twenty-five dollars
($25.00) plus an amount equal to any increase in the fees or charges required
for such permit, and provided, further, that if the owner was ordered to
connect his or her property to and use the sewer system by the Montgomery
County Combined General Health District before expiration of the original
permit, the charge for renewal of a sewer permit shall then be equal to the
charge current at the time of such order.
   The renewal of a permit for connection to the water system, when issued by
the Director, shall be valid for the property for which original application
was made, provided, however, that the connection permitted is made within six
months of the date of issuance. However, if the connection permitted in such
renewal is not made within six months of the date of issuance, then provisions
of this section for renewal of original permits shall apply.
   Unused water and sewer connection permits which are not renewed as provided
herein shall be void and the permit fees paid to the City shall be refunded to
the applicant less an administrative charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for
each expired permit.
   No permit shall be renewed for connection to a property on which the owner
permits the continuation of any violations of City ordinances or regulations
pertaining to buildings, zoning, sewage, water or health matters.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71.)
1040.13 TRANSFER OF CONNECTION PERMITS; FEES.
   Water and sewer connection permits are valid only for the property shown on
the respective permit application. Such permits may be transferred to other
properties, provided that satisfaction of the requirements of Section
1040.04 is demonstrated, and provided, further, that, before any such transfer
shall be valid, a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus an amount equal to
any costs incurred by the City in transferring the connection shall be paid to
the City in addition to all other fees and charges provided in this chapter and
in Chapters
1044 and
1052.
(Ord. 71-51. Passed 10-19-71; Ord. 99-17. Passed 5-25-99.)
1040.14 FINANCIAL POLICIES.
   The following financial policies are hereby established for operation of the
water and sewer systems:
   (a)   Water and sewer service charges and connection fees shall be fixed as
provided herein so as to provide sufficient revenues to pay all the costs of
the water and sewer systems, respectively, including, but not limited to, the
following operating, maintenance and repair costs: capital outlays necessary
for current and future operations generally benefiting all users; debt service,
including principal and interest costs, legal and service fees; refunds;
administrative and legal expenses; reasonable charges for the use of City
property and facilities; the creation and maintenance of a reserve for
emergencies equal to fifty percent of all of the most recent year's
expenditures, except capital outlay, debt service and contribution to the
reserve for emergencies, such reserve contributions to be in an annual amount
sufficient to create the required reserve within five years of the effective
date of this section; repayment of loans from other City funds; and maintenance
of the reserve.
   (b)   Water and sewer service charges for service to premises outside the
City shall be fixed as provided herein to be fifty percent greater than charges
for such service to premises within the City.
   (c)   Minimum charges for water and sewer service shall be fixed as provided
herein so as to provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of the water and
sewer systems, respectively, including the following: billing expenses; debt
service, including principal and interest costs; refunds; reasonable charges
for the use of City property and facilities; and a reserve for emergencies
equal to fifty percent of all of the most recent year's expenditures, except
capital outlay, debt service and contribution to the reserve for emergencies.
   (d)   Commodity charges for water and sewer service shall be fixed as
provided herein so as to provide sufficient revenues to pay all the costs of
the water and sewer systems, respectively, which are not included in the
minimum charges as provided for herein.
   (e)   Adjusted commodity charges shall remain proportional, for the various
quantities of water delivered, to commodity charges provided in base rates.
   (f)   Appropriations shall be made by Council to pay the costs of the water
and sewer systems, including the costs enumerated in subsection (a) hereof, for
each calendar year by March 31 of each year, but this section shall not be
interpreted to limit Council's power to appropriate funds for these purposes at
other times, provided, however, that such appropriations shall be sufficient to
pay all such costs for each year as reasonably anticipated.
   (g)   Payments made for public services, including but not limited to water
and sewer charges and connection fees, shall be deposited into the City
Treasury. Payments made in the form of debit from a demand deposit account,
including but not limited to a check, bill of exchange, draft, order of
withdrawal, or electronic transaction, shall be considered negotiable
immediately at the time such payment is made to the City. When such payment is
deposited in the City Treasury and subsequently returned as non-negotiable for
any reason, a service fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) shall be levied
against the offending party. Full restitution of the non-negotiable payment,
plus the service fee, shall be required within three business days after
written notice is given to the offending party. If restitution is not made
within three business days, the water supply may be disconnected. When any
water supply has been disconnected because of the consumer's failure to make
restitution as provided herein, the consumer shall pay thirty-five dollars
($35.00) as the fee for having the water supply reconnected. If reconnection is
required outside of regular business hours, the reconnection fee shall be
doubled.
   (h)   The cash balances of the water and sewer funds may be pooled together
with the cash balances of the other various funds for investment purposes,
provided that interest earned on such cash balances shall be proportionately
returned to the water and sewer operating funds.

1040.16 RATES.
   The Finance Director is hereby authorized and directed to compute and
certify to Council for its approval as provided herein adjusted rates for water
and sewer service each year pursuant to policies established herein. When so
approved, such adjusted rates shall supersede and become the charges for water
and sewer service provided in Chapters
1044 and
1052 and shall be paid by consumers for such service in the same manner as
provided in such chapters for the base rates provided therein. Adjusted rates
certified to Council by the Director shall be in conformity with Section
1040.14 and the phrase "all costs of the water and sewer systems" shall mean
amounts equal to the annual appropriations for water and sewer operations,
maintenance and repair, including labor capital outlay, debt service, plus
amounts for charges for the use of City property and facilities, administrative
and legal expenses, and creation and maintenance of the required reserve for
emergencies, less amounts reasonably expected to be collected as connection
fees. In the event the annual appropriations are limited by the Ohio Revised
Code to amounts less than sufficient to pay all the above costs and expenses,
the Director shall prepare an estimate of such costs and expenses for the year
for the water and sewer systems, and, when approved by Council, such estimates
shall be the "costs of the water and sewer systems" referred to above and in
Section
1040.14(a).
   The Director shall compute adjusted water and sewer rates and certify them
to Council as provided herein not more than sixty days after adoption of the
annual appropriation ordinances or by June 1 each year, whichever comes sooner.
   Council shall approve, disapprove or modify adjusted rates for water and
sewer service certified to it by the Director, by resolution. In the event the
rates certified by the Director are disapproved or modified, the resolution
disapproving the rates or approving modified rates shall include a statement of
the reasons therefor and how the rates approved by Council better conform to
the policies of Section
1040.14. In the event Council fails to approve, disapprove or modify the rates
certified to it by the Director within fortyfive days of the date such rates
are certified to it, they shall stand approved without Council action. Adjusted
rates fixed pursuant to this chapter shall be effective for all water use and
sewer service occurring after the first day of the month following the date
such adjusted rates are approved and shall remain in effect thereafter until
revised as provided herein.

system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system, and
pollutants which can not be adequately treated and pass through the system into
receiving waters or the atmosphere;
   (c)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge;
   (d)   To ensure worker health and safety; and
   (e)   To satisfy State and Federal requirements.
   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the City's
wastewater system and storm water system through the issuance of wastewater
discharge permits and the enforcement of administrative regulations. This
chapter does not provide for the recovery of operations, maintenance or
replacement costs of the wastewater treatment facility or other costs
associated with the construction of collection and treatment systems used by
industrial discharges, in proportion to their use of the wastewater treatment
facility, which are the subject of separate enactments.

1222.01 FINDINGS.
   Council hereby finds that the lands and waters of the City are natural
assets and resources and that such lands are being despoiled and such waters
are being polluted as the result of erosion and deposit of sediment arising
from disturbances and changes of the surface of such lands.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72. )
1222.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public safety, health,
convenience and general welfare and to protect property, lands and waters
within the City, to the extent practical, by alleviating harmful and damaging
effects of on-site erosion, siltation on neighboring downhill and downstream
properties and pollution of streams and bodies of water during and after
development, through adequate controls of erosion and sedimentation of both a
temporary and permanent nature. Such controls shall be provided by the property
owner during all phases of any clearing, stripping, excavating, filling,
grading, construction or other activity involving the disturbance of natural
terrain or vegetative ground cover.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72.)
1222.03 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   All public and private development of areas for nonagricultural uses, such
as housing, commercial, industrial and recreational development, roads and
utility services, shall comply with this chapter, except as exempted by Section
1222-05.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72.)
1222.04 GRADING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Except as exempted by Section
1222.05, no person shall do any clearing, stripping, excavating, filling,
grading, construction or other activity involving the disturbance of natural
terrain or vegetative ground cover unless he or she has a valid grading permit
therefor issued by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72.)
1222.05 EXCEPTIONS.
   A grading permit will not be required under the following conditions:
   (a)   For the construction of a single-family or two-family structure which
is located on a lot within a plat that has received final approval in
accordance with the Subdivision Regulations, provided, however, that erosion
and sedimentation control measures have been and are being employed in
accordance with the approved grading, drainage, erosion and sedimentation
control plans and specifications for the plat;
   (b)   For activity pursuant to a permit issued by the Director of Service in
accordance with Section
1020.01 for work in streets or rights of way dedicated to public use, provided,
however, that erosion and sedimentation control measures as approved by the
City Engineer have been and are being employed;
   (c)   For authorized City capital improvement and public works projects,
provided, however, that erosion and sedimentation control measures as approved
by the City Engineer have been and are being employed;
   (d)   For accepted agricultural land management practices, such as plowing
and construction of agricultural structures and nursery operations such as the
removal and/or transplanting of cultivated sod, shrubs and trees, tree cutting
at or above existing ground and logging operations leaving the stump, ground
cover and root mat intact;
   (e)   For individual private septic systems which do not alter the natural
terrain;
   (f)   For excavation below finished grade for basements and pads for
additions to a single-family structure or for retaining walls, swimming pools
or accessory buildings authorized by a valid building permit, unless a
possibility for erosion and sedimentation or alteration of drainage is such as
to necessitate a grading permit as determined by the City Engineer; and
   (g)   For quarry operations and the stockpiling, with slopes at a natural
angle of repose, of raw or processed sand, stone and gravel at quarries,
concrete, asphalt and material processing plants and storage yards, provided
that sediment and erosion measures as approved by the City Engineer have been
and are being employed.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72.)
1222.06 PERMIT APPLICATION.
   To obtain a permit, an applicant shall first file an application therefor in
writing upon forms furnished by the City. Eight copies of the application and
the required plans, specifications, timing schedule and cost estimate shall be
filed with the City Engineer. The application must be signed by the owner of
the property or an authorized agent. If the owner is a corporation, it must be
signed by the president or vice-president thereof, attested by the secretary or
assistant secretary thereof and the corporate seal affixed. A separate

(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72. )
1222.08 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Detailed plans and specifications for effective erosion and
sedimentation control shall be based on the practical combination of the
following principals:
      (1)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. (2) The development plan should be fitted to the topography and
soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development.
      (4)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be
kept to the shortest practical period of time.
      (5)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching should be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development.
      (6)   Planned engineering works should be constructed to slow down the
velocity of run-off.
      (7)   The volume of run-off on a denuded area should be reduced with
planned diversions to protected areas.
      (8)   Provisions should be made to effectively accommodate the
concentrated and increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface
conditions during and after development.
      (9)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps)
should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development.
      (10)   Frequent inspection and continual maintenance of erosion and
sedimentation controls should be performed.
      (11)   The permanent final vegetation and structures should be installed
as soon as practical in the development.
   (b)   All plans and specifications shall include provisions for erosion and
sedimentation control in substantial accordance with the latest revised issue
of "Water Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas" published by
the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service,
Columbus, Ohio, and any other applicable standards as Council may adopt by
resolution, which are hereby incorporated in this chapter by reference.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72.)
1222.09 ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   (a)   In granting any permit, the City Engineer may attach such conditions
thereto as he or she may deem reasonably necessary to prevent danger to public
or private property or to any sewer, storm drain or watercourse, or to prevent
the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or
in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions may include, but are
not limited to, the erection or installation of walls, drains, dams,
structures, plantings, vegetation and erosion and sediment control measures or
devices, furnishing necessary easements and a specified method of performing
the work. No permit shall be issued until the grading, erosion and sediment
control plans, specifications, timing schedule and cost estimate are approved
by the City Engineer and until the developer certifies that all work will be
performed pursuant to the approved plans, specifications and schedules.
   (b)   If the application conforms substantially to the requirements of this
chapter, the City Engineer shall approve the same and forward one copy with a
grading permit to the applicant without unreasonable delay. If the application
does not so conform, the application shall be disapproved by the City Engineer
and his or her written disapproval, with the reasons therefor, shall be
forwarded to the applicant without unreasonable delay.
   (c)   After actual work begins, the City Engineer may require additional or
revised controls from time to time in the event the originally approved
controls prove to be inadequate.
   (d)   Permits issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the owner of
responsibility for securing required permits for work to be done which is
regulated by any other applicable code or ordinance.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72. )
1222.10 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PERMITTEE.
   During grading operations the permittee shall be responsible for:
   (a)   Carrying out the proposed work in accordance with the grading permit
and the approved plans, specifications and timing schedule, and in compliance
with all the requirements of this chapter;
   (b)   The prevention of damage to any public utilities or the interruption
of services within the limits of grading and along any routes of travel of
construction equipment;
   (c)   The prevention of damage to adjacent property. No person shall grade
on land so close to the property line as to endanger any adjoining public
street, sidewalk, alley or public or private property without supporting and
protecting such property from settling, cracking or other damage which might
result.
   (d)   The prompt removal of all soil, miscellaneous debris or other material
spilled, dumped or otherwise deposited on public streets, highways, sidewalks
or other public thoroughfares during transit to and from the construction site.
The construction of a haul road or other approved vehicle cleaning method may
be required by the City Engineer to prevent the spread of debris.
   (e)   The prevention of all sediment from entering into any public sewerage
system or watercourse.

   If the applicant is unable to complete the work within the time specified in
the permit, he or she may, prior to the expiration of such time, present in
writing a request for an extension of time, setting forth the reasons for the
requested extension. If the City Engineer finds that such an extension is
warranted, he or she may grant additional time for the completion of the work
subject to such additional measures as he or she may reasonably require.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72. )
1222.13 PLAN MODIFICATIONS.

1222.14 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   The City Engineer shall, before issuing a permit, require a cash bond or
corporate bond in a form satisfactory to him or her and approved by the
Director of Law, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the conditions in
the permit and soil erosion and sediment control measures specified in the
permit within the time specified in the permit or within any extension thereof
granted by the City Engineer, in the amount of the total estimated cost of all
erosion and sediment control measures and safeguards for adjoining property.
The City Engineer may grant a waiver of such bond, upon application, where he
or she finds minimal impairment of existing surface drainage, minimal erosion
hazard and minimal sedimentation hazard upon any adjacent land or watercourse
and no hazard to human life or property.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72. )
1222.15 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   If the City Engineer finds that the nature of the work is such that it may
create a hazard to human life, or endanger adjoining property or property at a
higher or lower elevation, or any street or street improvement, or any other
public property, then the City Engineer may, before issuing the permit, require
that the applicant for a permit file a certificate of insurance showing that he
or she is insured against claims for damages for personal injury and property
damage in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000),
including damage to the City by deposit or washing of material onto City
streets or other public improvements which may arise from or out of the
performance of the work, whether such performance is by himself or herself, his
or her subcontractor or any person directly or indirectly employed by him or
her. The amount of such insurance shall be prescribed by the City Engineer in
accordance with the nature of the risks involved. Such insurance shall be
written by a company licensed to do business in the State and approved by the
City. Neither issuance of a permit nor compliance with the provisions hereof or
any condition imposed by the City shall relieve any person from any
responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law nor
impose any liability upon the City for damage to persons or property.
(Ord. 72-41. Passed 12-12-72; Res. 19-88. Passed 4-26-88.)

1224.01 FINDINGS.
   Council hereby finds that changes in land use and zoning classification
resulting from the sprawl of urbanization has often necessitated the removal of
trees and other valuable natural resources and often has the effect of
degrading the appearance, character and value of existing land use patterns
within and surrounding the City.

1224.02 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to protect and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare by fully utilizing the benefits of landscaping in
new developments to ensure that the local stock of native trees is replenished;
to contribute to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, ground
water recharge and storm water run-off retardation, while at the same time
aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement; to buffer uncomplimentary and often
incompatible land uses by providing a transitional interface; to assist in
controlling traffic to and from, as well as within, off-street parking
facilities by limiting the internal movement of vehicles and pedestrians to
designated traffic configurations; to relieve the blighted appearance of
parking lots; and to otherwise facilitate the creation of a convenient,
attractive and harmonious community and preserve a healthful and pleasant

1226.02 PARK LAND STANDARD.
   It is found and determined that parks and recreational facilities are as
vital to the public good as are streets and sidewalks, water and sanitary
sewerage systems and other required public improvements and physical
facilities. Therefore, the public health, safety and welfare require that at
least ten acres of property for each 1,000 persons residing within the planning

information as it may have or be able to obtain tending to show the same,
including, without limitation, any plans, estimates or statements of intention
furnished by the subdivider or developer concerned relating to the proposed
improvement of the subdivision or development, the nature and topography of the
land involved and the nature and kind of improvements actually planned or
probable thereon.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.08 CHOICE OF LAND OR FEE.
   (a)   Determination by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall
determine whether a subdivider or developer shall dedicate land, pay a fee in
lieu of land dedication or provide a combination of land dedication and fee
payment.
   (b)   Procedure. In making the determination referred to in subsection (a)
hereof, the following procedure shall apply:
      (1)   Filings. At the time of filing a preliminary plat map pursuant to
the Subdivision Regulations or a development plan for approval, each subdivider
or developer shall, as a part of such filing, indicate whether he or she plans
to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, to pay a fee in lieu of
dedication or to meet the requirements of this chapter by a combination of land
dedication and fee payment. If such subdivider or developer plans to dedicate
land, he or she shall indicate the area he or she desires to dedicate on the
preliminary plat map or development plan.
      (2)   Planning Commission determination. After the Commission has
reviewed such preliminary plat maps and development plans, it shall determine
whether the plans of the subdivider or developer to dedicate land, pay a fee in
lieu of dedication or provide a combination of dedication and fee payment are
acceptable. Insofar as practical, the determination of the Commission shall be
compatible with the Parks and Recreation Plan.
      (3)   Minimum dedication. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, no dedication of land shall be required and a fee in lieu thereof
shall be paid in the event the amount of dedication required by this chapter
would be less than one acre, except in the event the land so dedicated could be
added to the adjoining, contiguous land area of an existing park or
recreational facility. This consideration shall not be construed to prohibit
the voluntary dedication of land by subdividers and developers in addition to
the requirements imposed by this chapter.
      (4)   Adverse effects of development; reclamation. If, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, any portion of land proposed for dedication has been
or will be adversely affected by the operations of a subdivider or developer,
and such land or portion thereof will require reclamation in order to render it
suitable as a park or recreational facility planned therefore, the Commission
may require the subdivider or developer to furnish a plan for such reclamation.
The Commission shall seek the advice of the City Engineer with respect to any
such plan and shall determine, on the basis of such advise, whether such plan
is acceptable in view of the purpose of this chapter. This plan shall accompany
or be part of the final plat construction drawings as specified in the
Subdivision Regulations and shall include estimates of cost for reclamation and
any other data required by the Commission or the City Engineer. In the event
such plan is acceptable, the subdivider or developer concerned shall implement
such plan in a reasonable time and shall be required to post a performance bond
in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of the reclamation according
to the procedure set forth in Section
1242.06 of the Subdivision Regulations.
      (5)   Criteria. In making its determination, the Commission shall utilize
the following criteria:
         A.   Unity. Dedicated land must form a single parcel of land, except
in the event the Planning Commission determines that two or more parcels would
be in the best public interest.
         B.   Shape and topography. The shape of the dedicated parcel of land
must be sufficiently geometric to be usable for recreational activities, such
as softball, tennis, football and other active recreational pursuits. In
addition, steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses and flood plains may
constitute a maximum of forty percent of the dedicated land, and a minimum of
sixty percent of the recreational land requirement shall be suitable for dry
ground recreational use. In this latter regard, fifty percent of the dry ground
recreation area shall not exceed three percent grade, and the remaining dry
ground recreation area shall not exceed five percent grade. However, this
requirement may be waived, in whole or in part, if the Commission determines
that the recreational needs of any subdivision are adequately met by other
dedicated parcels or existing recreational facilities. Further, this
requirement may be waived, in whole or in part, if the Commission determines
that although certain land areas to be dedicated are not usable for dry ground
recreational use, such areas are of unique natural beauty or environmental or
historic value.
         C.   Location. Dedicated land must be centrally located in order to
serve the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision or development for
which the dedication was made. The recreation land in a subdivision or
development must be located so that it is reasonably accessible from all
dwelling units within the subdivision.
         D.   Access. Public access and maintenance access to the dedicated
land shall be provided by an adjoining street frontage equal to the full width
of each dedicated parcel or 400 feet, whichever is less, or by a public
easement of equal size, allowing access to the dedicated parcel or parcels.
         E.   Preservation of natural beauty. In all instances, natural
features of scenic beauty, such as trees, plant life, brooks and other
watercourses, topography, historic locations, views and similar conditions
which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated land,
shall be considered and preserved in the dedication of open space and parks and
recreation areas.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77.)
1226.09 AMOUNT OF LAND TO BE DEDICATED.
   The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider or developer pursuant to
this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
Acres of land for dedication = Total population as determined in accordance
with Section
1226.07 x . 005.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77.)
1226.10 FEE IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
   (a)   Amount of Fee in Lieu.In the event the Planning Commission determines
that a subdivider or developer must pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, the
amount of such fee shall be determined by the following formula:
Fee in lieu of land   Land area that would      Fair market
dedication    =   otherwise be required    x   value/acre to be dedicated
                      pursuant to Section
1226.09
   (b)   Determination of Fair Market Value. Fair market value shall be
determined in accordance with Section
1226.12.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77.)
1226.11 PARK DEVELOPMENT FEE.
   (a)   Amount of Development Fee. In addition to the dedication of land,
payment of a fee in lieu of dedication, or a combination of dedication and fee
payment, each subdivider and developer shall be required to pay a park
development fee. The amount of the park development fee shall be equal to one-
third of the total fair market value of land required to be dedicated with
respect to any subdivision or development in accordance with Section
1226.09.
   (b)   Determination of Fair Market Value., Fair market value shall be
determined in accordance with Section
1226.12.
   (c)   Credit for Voluntary Dedication. In the event a subdivider or
developer dedicates land in addition to the land required to be dedicated
pursuant to Section
1226.09, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, such subdivider or
developer shall receive credit against the amount of the development fee
otherwise required by subsection (a) hereof equal to an amount up to a maximum
of one-third of the fair market value of such additional land to be dedicated.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.12 DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.
   For the purposes of this chapter, fair market value shall be determined as
follows:
   (a)   Time for Determination. Fair market value shall be determined as of
the time of filing the final plat map or final development plan with the
Planning Commission.
   (b)   Method of Value Determination. Fair market value shall equal the
average value per acre of all land in each subdivision or development in its
raw, undeveloped state, determined by application of one of the following
procedures:
      (1)   By agreement between the subdivider or developer and the Planning
Commission;
      (2)   In the event the subdivider or developer and the Commission cannot
agree, by determination of the Commission on the basis of assessed value for
property tax purposes of all land in the subdivision or development, modified
to equal market value in accordance with current assessment practices, and
divided by the total number of acres within the subdivision or development;
      (3)   In the event the subdivider or developer objects to the valuation
method set forth in paragraph (2) hereof, by a qualified independent appraiser
approved by the Planning Commission; or
      (4)   In the event the subdivider or developer objects to all of the
foregoing methods of valuation, by a three-member board of appraisers, one of
whom shall be appointed by the Commission, one of whom shall be appointed by
the subdivider or developer and one of whom shall be selected by the two
appraisers so appointed. The decision of a majority of such board shall be
final.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.13 CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Allowance of Credit. In the event a subdivider or developer provides
private open space for park and recreational purposes and such space is to be
privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision or
development, or by the subdivider or developer, and in the event the Planning
Commission determines that such private open space adequately fulfills the park
and recreation needs of the proposed subdivision or development, the fair
market value of such areas shall be credited against the land dedication and
park development fee requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Maximum Credit. Such credit, however, shall be allowed only up to a
maximum of two-thirds of the total required land dedication or fee-in-lieu
requirement, and up to a maximum of two-thirds of the total required park
development fee.
   (c)   Standards and Limitations.Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)
hereof, the credit for private open space shall be allowed only if the
following standards are met:
      (1)   Yards, court areas, setbacks and other such open areas required to
be maintained by the Zoning Code shall not be included in the computation of
such private open space.
      (2)   Private ownership, development and maintenance of the open space
shall be assured by valid and enforceable undertakings on the part of the
subdivider or developer, or otherwise.
      (3)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreation purposes by recorded covenants that run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the subdivision or development, which
covenants cannot, by their terms, be defeated or eliminated without the consent
of the Planning Commission.
      (4)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park
and recreational uses, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape,
topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land. (5)
Facilities proposed for the private open space are reasonably compatible with
those required by the Parks and Recreation Plan.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.14 REDUCTION OF MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND FRONTAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Land Dedication Only. In the event a subdivider or developer elects to
fulfill the land dedication requirements of this chapter solely by dedicating
land for park and recreational use, and such action is approved by the Planning
Commission as provided in Section
1226.08, the minimum lot area standards and frontage requirements applicable to
such subdivision or development, as provided in the Zoning Code, may be reduced
at the request of the subdivider or developer by five percent and two and one-
half percent, respectively. However, in the event a lot size and frontage
reduction pursuant to this subsection enables a subdivider or developer to
erect additional dwellings, a fee in lieu of land dedication, in an amount
determined in accordance with Section
1226.10, shall be required with respect to the additional population that would
be generated by each proposed additional dwelling.
   (b)   Land Dedication and Fee in Lieu Thereof. If the subdivider or
developer elects to fulfill the requirements of this chapter only in part
through the dedication of park land, and the Planning Commission approves such
action, the minimum lot area standards and frontage requirements applicable to
such subdivision or development may be reduced by a proportional percentage
amount of the respective five percent and two and one-half percent factors
provided in subsection (a) hereof, determined by comparing the actual amount of
dedicated land to the total land dedication requirement.
   (c)   Additional Voluntary Land Dedication. In the event a subdivider or
developer wishes to dedicate land for park and recreational use beyond the
dedication and fee-in-lieu requirements of this chapter, subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission, such subdivider or developer may reduce
the minimum lot area requirements and frontage requirements applicable to such
subdivision or development by subtracting the additional land area to be
dedicated for park and recreational use from the land areas to which the
minimum lot area requirement would otherwise be applied. However, no such
voluntary dedication shall result in a reduction of the minimum lot area
requirement greater than five percent or a proportional reduction in frontage
requirements in excess of two and one-half percent, in addition to the
reductions allowed pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, and provided, further,
that no such additional reduction in minimum lot area requirements shall result
in the erection of additional dwellings.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.15 TREATMENT OF LAND TO BE DEDICATED; PROCEDURE FOR DEDICATION OF LAND AND
PAYMENT OF FEES.
   (a)   Following approval of a preliminary plat map or development plan which
designates land for dedication, the existing vegetation (except growing
commercial crops other than growing timber), topography, features of historic
value, stream courses, soil, rock strata and other natural features of such
dedicated land shall not be altered or their condition adversely affected in
any way without the consent of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Dedication of land to the City shall be by a general warranty deed
conveying to the City, its successors and assigns, good and marketable title to
the real estate described in such deed, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances. This deed shall be executed and delivered to the City for
recording prior to the approval of the final plat map or development plan for
any section or any portion of the subdivision or development the boundary of
which is contiguous with the proposed park and recreational facility. Open
space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted
to the City prior to approval of the final plat map or development plan and
shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final plat map or development
plan. In the event fees, including the park development fee, are required, ten
percent of the amount thereof shall be deposited with the City prior to the
approval and recording of the final plat map or development plan, and the
balance shall be due and payable one year from such date, or at the time the
first occupancy permit is issued with respect to such subdivision or
development, whichever occurs first. In no event shall any occupancy permit be
granted with respect to such subdivision or development until all such fees are
deposited with the City.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.16 LIMITATION ON USE OF LAND AND FEES.
   Any land and fees received by the City pursuant to this chapter shall be
used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to
serve the area in which the subdivision or development concerned is located.
Fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in a Parks and Recreation
Capital Improvement Fund to be used for the acquisition, development and
improvement of park and recreational facilities. No part of such fees shall be
used for the purpose of paying salaries, wages or other general operating
expenditures, except when City forces are used to develop the respective park
site. Fees received may be expended only in connection with the acquisition or
development of parks and recreational facilities in reasonable proximity to the
subdivision or development they are meant to benefit. Parks and recreational
facilities so developed shall continue to be maintained so long as the
subdivision or development they are meant to benefit remains in use.
(Ord. 77-06. Passed 2-22-77. )
1226.17 ADJUSTMENTS.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the Planning
Commission may, in cases of an unusual or exceptional nature, allow for
adjustments in the park land dedication and fee-in-lieu regulations and in the
park development fee requirements, as required by this chapter. Adjustments may
be allowed when, in the opinion of the Commission, it has been determined and
satisfactorily shown that the character of the particular subdivision or
development and the park and recreation needs generated by and associated with
any subdivision or development sufficiently justify such an adjustment.
However, no adjustment from the strict application of any provision of this
chapter shall be granted by the Commission unless it finds, beyond reasonable
doubt, that all the following facts and conditions exist:
   (a)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the
land involved and which are not applicable to other lands in the immediate
vicinity.
   (b)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
   (c)   Granting the variance requested will provide the minimum necessary
relief to alleviate the hardship and will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege which is denied by this chapter to the other lands,
structures or buildings in the same vicinity.
   (d)   Granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

shall be deemed null and void. In the event a plat is considered invalid, such
plat shall then be resubmitted as a preliminary plat and shall meet all

conditions involving irregular, abnormally narrow, shallow or steep lots or
other unusual physical conditions such that strict and literal application of
such provisions or requirements would result in practical difficulty and
unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the
land or buildings involved, but in no other case. No variance from the strict
application of any provision of these Regulations shall be granted by the Board

relief to alleviate the hardship and will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege which is denied by these Regulations to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same vicinity; and

and intent of these Regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood
or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

incorporated into any building permit or certificate of occupancy whenever such
is authorized by the Board.
   The presence of all three members shall constitute a quorum. A concurring
vote of all three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse an
administrative decision of the Code Enforcement Officer or the Planning
Commission to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass by these Regulations, or to grant a variance from the
requirements of these Regulations. The Board shall act by resolution and a copy
of each resolution duly adopted shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of
Council.

in the Commission files and shall be marked with any corrections or additions
deemed necessary by the Code Enforcement Officer, by the officials or agencies
considered to have an interest in the proposed subdivision, and by the
Commission when the plat is considered for formal approval; one copy shall be
retained by the Code Enforcement Officer with corrections and additions noted;
and one copy shall be retained until after the first review and until such time
as all the various officials and agencies and the Commission have made their
review and comments on approval of the plat. This copy will then be marked and
returned with a letter of approval or disapproval to the subdivider. In
addition, prints of the preliminary plat may be distributed to agencies or
officials when an interest is involved that needs study.
   If, at some point in time following formal approval of the preliminary plat,
certain changes in the basic layout are desired by the developer, then a new
preliminary plat must be resubmitted for the total landholding to enable the
City to check for conformity with the City's Comprehensive Plan and utility
master plans.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1244.03 APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   Following application for approval of the preliminary plat, the Planning
Commission shall act on the preliminary plat within sixty-five days after its
official filing date unless there are reasons why action cannot be taken as
explained in subsection (b) hereof, or unless such time is extended by
agreement with the subdivider. The official filing date shall be considered to
be the day upon which the preliminary plat is received by the Commission at a
formal Commission meeting.
   If the preliminary plat and the application are correctly filed, the
Commission shall take the following action or actions within sixty-five days of
the official filing date:
   (a)   Approve the plat. Approval of a preliminary plat, either immediately
or following subsequent revisions or review, shall be effective for a maximum
period of twelve months and shall guarantee the subdivider impunity during this
time period against changes which may be made in these Regulations. This
twelve-month approval period shall bind the applicant to the need for the
submission for final approval of a final plat covering the whole or part or
parts of the preliminary plat. In the event the subdivider fails to submit a
final plat within the twelve-month approval period, encompassing all or part of
the area included in the preliminary plat, then the approval given to the
preliminary plat or the remaining portion of the preliminary plat shall lapse
and be considered null and void.
   (b)   Conduct a first review of the application and preliminary plat and
then return them to the subdivider with suggestions for changes, giving reasons
and specifying aspects of nonconformity with existing ordinances. Following the
first review of the preliminary plat, the Commission shall set a date for a
second review, notify the applicant in writing and notify other agencies or
persons whom it considers to have an interest in the proposed subdivision.
Following this second review by the Commission, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall return to the subdivider a copy of the preliminary plat along with a
letter of approval or disapproval. If the preliminary plat is approved by the
Commission, the applicant shall be authorized to proceed with the preparation
of the final plat. If, however, the preliminary plat is disapproved by the
Commission, the Commission shall advise the applicant as to the necessary
changes in the preliminary plat which will be required, giving reasons and
specifying aspects of nonconformity with existing ordinances, before
preliminary approval can be conferred.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1244.04 FILING OF FINAL PLAT.
   An application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission not later than forty-five days prior to the Planning
Commission's next meeting, on administrative forms provided by the City,
together with nine copies of the final plat map and nine copies of construction
drawings, including the cover sheet, grading and drainage plans, erosion and
sedimentation control plans, street and utility improvement plans, three copies
of performance bond cost estimates and all pertinent design criteria and
calculations for water and sanitary sewer and storm sewer design. The final
plat shall be prepared and certified by a registered engineer.
   Prior to formal approval by the Planning Commission of the final plat and
accompanying construction drawings, the subdivider and/or developer shall
execute the required subdivider's contract and shall post a performance bond
with the City to ensure that all the required public improvements are in fact
installed in the subdivision, in accordance with the requirements outlined in
Chapters
1248 and
1250. The administrative procedure for posting this performance bond is
specified in
Chapter 1242.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1244.05 APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   Following application for approval of the final plat, the Planning
Commission shall act on the final plat within sixty-five days after its
official filing date. The official filing date shall be considered to be the
day upon which the final plat is received by the Commission at a formal
Commission meeting.
   The Commission shall review the final plat for conformity with the
preliminary plat and all other requirements specified in these Regulations. If
the plat is found to meet such requirements, it shall approve the plat and
recommend its approval and the acceptance of improvements by Council. Before
the Commission can approve the final plat and recommend its acceptance by
Council, assurances must be provided by the subdivider that the provisions of
Chapters
1248 and
1250 have been adhered to regarding improvements. Such assurances as will be
required shall take the form of approval forms supplied by the City and
certified by the Code Enforcement Officer, the City Engineer and such other
officials as are deemed necessary by the Planning Commission in order to assure
proper adherence to these Regulations. The provisions of Sections
1246.02 and
1246.03 must be complied with to warrant approval of the final plat by the
Commission. Within sixty-five days after receipt of the final plat from the
Commission, and of all required items for submission with such final plat,
Council shall approve or disapprove the plat.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1244.06 RECORDING OF FINAL PLAT.
   The Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the subdivider by mail of the
action of Council on the final plat, submitted within five working days after
the date of such action. The subdivider shall then record the final plat with
the County Recorder within ninety days. If such recording is not made within
ninety days, the approval shall become void and reapplication must be made.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1244.07 PROCEDURE FOR THREE-MILE JURISDICTIONAL AREA.
   The City may exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction with respect to these
Regulations over all land area up to three miles from the City's corporate
limits, except where such extraterritorial jurisdiction overlaps the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of an adjacent municipality, in which case the
City of Englewood's authority shall extend only over those subdivision lands
which are closer to the City's corporate boundaries than to the adjacent
municipality's corporate limits.
   In order to exercise such extraterritorial jurisdiction, the City must
certify its Official Thoroughfare Plan to the County for that portion of the
three-mile jurisdictional area over which the City intends to regulate the
platting of land.

1226.03
1248.01 CONFORMITY WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, ZONING CODE AND UTILITY PLANS.
   All subdivision plans shall conform to design standards that will encourage
sound development patterns. In particular, the subdivision plat shall conform
to the principles, standards, policies and proposals which are specified in the
Englewood Comprehensive Land Use Plan, the Zoning Code, the Wastewater
Collection General Plan Concept, the Waterworks General Plan Concept, the Storm
Drainage Master Plan and
Chapter 1222. The Official Thoroughfare Plan, alignments and geometric design
standards shall be binding on all street layouts shown on both the preliminary
and final plats.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1248.02 CHARACTER OF LAND; PRESERVATION OF PHYSICAL AND CULTURAL FEATURES.
   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely
for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or
other menace.
   Existing physical and cultural features which would add value to
development, such as trees, watercourses, waterfalls, historic sites and
similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible, through
careful design of the subdivision. The owner may place restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the Zoning
Code, but such restrictions shall be indicated on the subdivision plat.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73.)
1248.03 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   Proposed streets shall be coordinated so as to provide adequate circulation.
Street patterns shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a
residential subdivision. Where a street connection is necessary for the
appropriate development of adjoining land, the arrangement or extension of
streets shall include the extension of the subdivision street to the edge of
the subdivision.
   Streets shall be arranged such that adjacent building sites are at or above
the grades of the streets, where possible. Grades of streets shall conform as
closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades
and curves shall be avoided.
   Streets shall have the right of way prescribed on the Official Thoroughfare
Plan. All streets shall be constructed in accordance with such standards of
design and construction as Council may adopt.
   Where the subdivision borders an existing street and additional land is
required for realignment or widening of such street, as indicated by the
Official Thoroughfare Plan, or as otherwise determined by the Planning
Commission to be necessary, such additional right of way and dimensions shall
be shown and the right of way shall be dedicated on such plat.
   Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement, street signs, sidewalks,
driveway approaches, curbs, gutters, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm
sewers, fire hydrants and appurtenances, except where waivers are requested.
The Commission may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such public
improvements as it considers not necessary in the interest of the public
health, safety and general welfare.
   If placed in the street rights of way, underground utilities may be required
by the Commission to be placed between the paved roadway and the right-of-way
line, where possible, to simplify location and repair of the lines. The
subdivider shall install underground service connections to the property line
of each lot before the street is paved. Walks in pedestrian easements shall be
improved according to specifications and as shown on the construction plans.
Other easements and rights of way shall be cleared, graded and have grass cover
provided where required by the City Engineer.
   All streets shall be named and such names shall be subject to the approval
of the Commission. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in
spelling from other street names in the City so as not to cause confusion. A
street which is a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name.
Numbers as street names are not acceptable. House numbers will be assigned by
the Commission.
   The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of land
within the subdivision. The distance between the centerline of offset street
intersections shall not be less than 125 feet.
   Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley
adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the remainder of the street or alley
shall be platted to the prescribed width within the proposed subdivision.
   Subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform to
the required widths shall dedicate additional width along either or both sides
of such a street and shall construct such improvements as are necessary to
bring such street up to the standards specified in these Regulations for the
entire street within or adjacent to the new subdivision.
   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly at right angles as
possible. T-intersections shall be used wherever possible; four-legged
intersections should be used only if streets are noncontinuous; multiple-legged
or "Y" intersections at acute angles and intersections with obstructions should
be avoided.
   Streets serving commercial development and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with major or secondary thoroughfares so as not to generate
traffic on local access streets. Collector streets for industrial subdivisions
shall be planned to serve industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with
either major or secondary thoroughfares so that no industrial traffic will be
directed into any local access streets.
   Alleys will not be allowed in residential areas, but may be included in
commercial and industrial areas where needed for loading and unloading or
access purposes. Where platted, they shall be at least twenty feet in width.
   Private streets shall be built to the same engineering standard as public
streets with respect to compaction, depth and type of base materials, surfacing
materials, etc.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73; Ord. 87-17. Passed 6-9-87.)
1248.04 BLOCKS.
   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street planning
criteria set forth in Section
1248.03.
   Irregularly shaped blocks, such as those intended for cul-de-sacs and loop
streets and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Planning Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance
of interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
   Blocks should not normally exceed 1,500 feet unless unusual circumstances
justify a greater length. Within blocks of over 800 feet in length, the
Planning Commission may require dedication of a ten-foot right of way, at or
near the middle of the block, as a public pedestrian walkway connecting
adjacent streets or other public areas, shopping centers, etc.
   Blocks should be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where an interior street parallels a secondary
arterial or major or secondary thoroughfare.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73.)
1248.05 LOTS.
   The layout of lots shall be platted so that individual building sites will
be properly related to topography and the character of surrounding development.
   Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning Code
for the respective zoning districts in which the lots may be located.
Dimensions of corner lots shall yield at least 125 percent of the minimum lot
area required by the applicable zoning district to allow for the proper
placement of the principal buildings so as to observe minimum front yard
setbacks. A lot should not have an average depth which is more than three times
its average width or a depth of less than 100 feet.
   Side lot lines shall be generally at right angles or radial to street right-
of-way lines unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot
layout.
   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided, except where the conditions
described in paragraph four of Section
1248.04 prevail.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73; Ord. 98-11. Passed 7-14-98.)
1248.06 EASEMENTS.
   Easements at least twenty feet in width centered along rear lot lines and
ten feet in width centered along side lot lines shall be provided along such
lot lines where it is necessary to provide for sanitary sewers, water mains,
gas mains, electric lines and other services. Where it is not feasible to
center the easements on lot lines, the location of such easements shall be
approved by the City Engineer and the easements shall be at least ten feet in
width. Wider easements may be required when conditions warrant, as determined
by the City Engineer.
   Such easements shall be dedicated to the use of any person for the purposes
of installing and/or maintaining utilities within the easement. Use of such
easements shall not be limited to the owner of the land within which the
easement exists.

by the City Engineer. The plans for the complete installation, showing the
size, location, depth and material of the system, and all connections thereto,
including fire hydrants, shall meet the requirements and receive the approval
of the City Engineer.
   All installations of, and provisions for, water supplies for subdivided land
shall only be carried out after the subdivider has furnished the City Engineer
with a complete set of plans and profiles designed in accordance with such
standards for design and construction as Council may adopt.
   Water lines serving cul-de-sacs shall be connected back into the water

(Ord. 83-2. Passed 1-11-83.)
1250.08 POLICY ON SIZE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   The improvements specified in Sections
1250.01 through
1250.07 shall be designed and built in accordance with the sizes and capacities
called for in the City's Official Thoroughfare Plan, the Sanitary Sewer
Collection System General Plan Concept, the Waterworks General Plan Concept and
the Storm Drainage Master Plan.
   Whenever public improvements required in this chapter are installed to such
a size which is required for the benefit of property owners in addition to the
subdivider, the City may enter into agreements with the subdivider to require
reimbursement of the extra costs thereof to the subdivider by the benefited
property owners when such improvements are utilized by such property owners.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1250.09 POLICY ON OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS.
   If a proposed plat is not contiguous to an area served by streets or public
utilities, and the Planning Commission finds that the extension of streets and
utilities across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special
assessment to the intervening properties or as a Municipal expense until some
future time, the subdivider may be required, prior to approval of the final
plat, to obtain the necessary easements or rights of way and construct such
extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers
of all adjoining land.
   Whenever public improvements required in this chapter are installed, which
improvements benefit property owners in addition to the subdivider, the City
may enter into agreements with the subdivider to require reimbursement of the
extra costs thereof to the subdivider by the benefited property owners when
such improvements are utilized by such property owners.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73.)
1250.10 LANDSCAPING AND TREE COVER; STREET TREES.
   Existing tree cover within the proposed plat shall be retained to the
greatest extent possible and taken fully into account in the design of the
subdivision lots and street layout. Street trees, which, as used herein, mean
shade and ornamental trees to be planted within public rights of way, generally
between sidewalks and curbs, or on easements immediately adjacent to public
rights of way or on road center-medians, shall be planted in accordance with
plans prepared by the subdivider and approved by the City Engineer to meet such
standards for street tree plantings as Council may adopt. Street tree plantings
shall be carried out under City supervision within the time fixed or agreed
upon by the City Engineer. All inspection costs shall be paid for by the
subdivider.
   Standards for street trees and street tree plantings shall designate the
number, location, size, variety and condition of trees to be planted and
planting methods. The number of trees planted shall be at least one per single-
family residential lot frontage and the standards may require additional trees
for two-family and multifamily residential lots, commercial and industrial
lots, corner lots and lots with exceptionally long frontages. The standards may
require additional trees where the varieties of trees proposed are normally
planted in close proximity, such as flowering or miniature varieties. The
standards shall encourage use of an assortment of varieties to avoid mass
plantings of a single variety or of few varieties.
   The standards shall provide regulations restricting tree plantings in
locations where they are likely to damage underground or aerial utility
facilities; restrict motorists' or pedestrians' site distances; conflict with
driveways, sidewalks, bikeways or streets; or damage street, sidewalk, storm
sewer, curb and gutter or other public facility structures.
   Street trees shall be included among the various public improvements
required by these Regulations and shall also be included in the contracts,
performance bonds and maintenance bonds required by Section
1242.06. Street trees shall become the property and responsibility of the City
upon expiration of the maintenance bonds provided for in Section 1242. 06.
(Ord. 74-32. Passed 8-13-74. )
1250.11 MONUMENTS AND MARKERS.
   The number and location of permanent reference monuments shall be approved
by the City Engineer. A minimum of two permanent concrete reference monuments
shall be required in each subdivision. Such permanent markers shall be placed
in a manner so that the line of sight between such markers can be observed from
one marker to the other. Permanent reference markers shall be of one-inch steel
rod set in, and running through, a concrete block at least six inches in
diameter and at least thirty inches long. The bottom of such concrete block
shall be set at least thirty inches deep below the finished grade in the
subdivision, and the points at which all such permanent markers may be found
shall be designated on the plat.
   Iron pin monuments, five-eighths of an inch in diameter and thirty inches
long, shall be placed by the surveyor at all points on the plat boundary lines
where there is a change of direction not marked by a concrete monument and at
all lot corners, before the final acceptance of a plat.

1252.01 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   In order to promote the health and general welfare of the public and
to preserve and make available open space, the Planning Commission may grant a
subdivider the right to vary the yard setbacks and building placement within
the zoning lot to be developed, leaving common open space free of buildings.
The right to vary yard setbacks and building placement shall, however, be
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   An overall plan of the entire tract, showing roads, lot lines, lot
areas, easements, encumbrances and other relevant data, shall be submitted in
accordance with Chapters
1244 through
1250.
      (2)   Overall density shall not exceed that of the zoning district in
which the proposed subdivision is located. The houses in the proposed
subdivision shall be grouped in clusters. The minimum lot area shall be one-
half of the minimum lot area normally required in the zoning district in which
the subdivision is located.
      (3)   The balance of the land in a proposed subdivision that is not
contained in lots or within road rights of way shall be contiguous and of such
condition, size and shape as to be usable for recreation. Such land shall be
held in corporate ownership by the owners of lots within the development, and
the subdivider shall incorporate into the deeds of all property within the
development a clause giving to the owners an interest in such open land which
shall be used for free recreational purposes only. No structure, except those
incidental to the recreational use, shall be permitted thereon.
   (b)   Open land shall be a minimum of one and one-half acres and shall be
subject to taxation. In the case of tracts of three or more acres, the
developer may petition the City to accept dedication of the land to be used in
perpetuity as public open space.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73. )
1252.02 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   Planned unit development shall be permitted in keeping with Section
1248.02 and designed to make more efficient use of land thereby better serving
the general health and welfare of the community. Such development may require
modification, subject to Planning Commission approval and to the provisions of
Sections
1248.01,
1248.04,
1248.05,
1250.03 and
1250.10.
(Ord. 73-09. Passed 3-13-73.)
1252.03 PROCEDURE FOR SINGLE PARCEL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   The improvement of one or more parcels of land by the erection or
enlargement thereon of any two-family or more residential structure or any
commercial or industrial structure shall be considered "subdivision" in these
Regulations and may be referred to as "single parcel development" or "single
parcel development subdivision. " The regulations, requirements and procedures
provided in these Regulations for subdivision, except as modified in this
section or by the Planning Commission pursuant to Section
1242.15, shall apply to single parcel development.
   (b)   Streets, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, sanitary sewers, water supply,
storm drainage and other public facilities and utilities, required to bring
single parcel development subdivisions to a state of improvement wherein the
standards and requirements of Sections
1250.01 through
1250.07 are met for rights of way and easements on, across or adjoining such
parcels, shall be required. Single parcel development subdividers shall provide
for the dedication of land necessary to bring adjoining and interior streets to
the right-of-way width established by the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
      (1)   The maximum area of land required to be so dedicated shall not
exceed twenty-five percent of the area of any parcel. In no event shall such
dedication reduce the lot below a width of sixty feet or an area of 7,500
square feet.
      (2)   No additional improvements shall be required on such parcels where
complete facilities and utilities required by Sections
1250.01 through
1250.07 exist within the present dedication contiguous thereto, but right-of-
way or easement dedication is nevertheless required.
      (3)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following:
         A.   Additions and accessory buildings incidental to residential uses
legally existing on the parcel, provided that no additional dwelling units are
created; or
         B.   Additions and accessory buildings incidental to other than
residential uses existing at the time of the passage of these Regulations
(March 13, 1973), provided that the total cumulative floor area of all such
additions and accessory buildings does not exceed 200 square feet.
   (c)   Single parcel development subdividers shall submit to the City
Engineer such plans, documents and information, including those items required
for record plans and construction drawings listed in Sections
1246.02 and
1246.03, as are required to review the proposed single parcel development for
conformity with these Regulations and other City regulations. After the City
Engineer finds that the plans of the proposed single parcel development
subdivision conform to applicable regulations, and after the subdivider
executes the contract and posts the performance bond required by these
Regulations to guarantee the installation of required public improvements, the
City Engineer shall approve the single parcel development. The submissions to
and the approvals required by the Planning Commission and Council set forth in
Sections
1244.02 through
1244.05 shall not be required for single parcel development, provided, however,
that the proposed single parcel development does not create or establish more
than one lot.
   (d)   The provisions of Section
1242.03 relating to the power of the Board of Appeals shall be applicable to
single parcel development subdivisions.
   (e)   No person shall create or establish any single parcel development
subdivision without first having met the requirements of these Regulations. No
building or zoning permit shall be issued by the Code Enforcement Officer for
the erection or enlargement of any structure unless the requirements of these
Regulations are met. No water or sewer permit shall be issued by the Director
of Finance for the erection or enlargement of any structure unless the
requirements of these Regulations are met.

1260.01 SHORT TITLE AND BASIS FOR ESTABLISHMENT.
   (a)   This Zoning Code shall be known and may be cited as "The Englewood,
Ohio, Zoning Ordinance," or just the "Zoning Code."
   (b)   This Zoning Code, including the text and map, has been promulgated in
accordance with and predicated upon the Englewood Comprehensive Community
Development Plan and is designed to provide adequate light, air, privacy and
safety from fire, flood and other danger and to prevent overcrowding of the
land and undue congestion of population. It is also designed to:
      (1)   Protect the character and the social and economic stability of all
parts of the City; to guide the orderly growth and development of the City; and
to protect and conserve the value of land and buildings appropriate to the
various land use classes established in the Comprehensive Community Development
Plan and this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Promote the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land
and buildings, and the street system which serves these uses, having particular
regard to the potential, amount and intensity of such land and building uses in
relationship to the traffic capacity of the street system, so as to avoid
congestion in the streets and to promote safe and convenient vehicular and
pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land and
buildings throughout the City;
      (3)   Provide a guide for public action in the orderly and efficient
provision of public facilities and services and for private enterprise in
building development, investment and other economic activity relating to uses
of land and buildings throughout the City; and
      (4)   Provide open space designed to protect the scenic beauty and
natural features of the City as well as to provide recreation space.
   (c)   This Zoning Code is promulgated with reasonable regard to existing
conditions; the character of buildings erected in each zoning district; the
most desirable use for which the land in each zoning district may be adapted;
and the conservation of property values.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79. )
1260.02 AREA OF JURISDICTION.
   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall apply to the entire incorporated
land area of the City.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
1260.03 GENERAL APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS.
   Except as hereinafter provided:
   (a)   The provisions specified in this Zoning Code shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience and general welfare.
   (b)   Where provisions of this Zoning Code impose a greater restriction upon
the use of buildings or premises, or upon height of buildings, or require
larger open spaces or lot areas than that required by other Municipal
ordinances, the provisions of this Zoning Code shall control.
   (c)   No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or
structurally altered, nor shall any building be moved onto the zoning lot or
within the same zoning lot, nor shall any parcel of land described by metes and
bounds or any lot hereafter be created, which does not conform and meet the
requirements of this Zoning Code, except as provided in Section
1268.08.
   (d)   No building shall, after this Zoning Code is enacted, be erected or
altered to:
      (1)   Exceed the height;
      (2)   Accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      (3)   Occupy a greater percentage of lot area; or
      (4)   Have a narrower or smaller rear yard, front yard or side yard than
is specified herein for the zoning district in which such building is located,
except as provided in Section
1266.02(b)(4).
   (e)   No land shall be used, except for a purpose permitted in the zoning
district in which it is located.
   (f)   Pre-existing uses shall be permitted to be continued according to the
following:
      (1)   Except as hereinafter specified, any use, building or structure,
existing at the time of the enactment of the original Zoning Ordinance 338 of
the City of Englewood, may be continued even though such use, building or
structure may not conform with the provisions of this Zoning Code for the
district in which it is located.
      (2)   Except as hereinafter specified, any use, building or structure,
existing prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, and at the time of
the enactment of Zoning Ordinance 519 of the City, may be continued even though
such use, building or structure may not conform with the provisions of this
Zoning Code for the district in which it is located, provided that it conforms
to the provisions of the original Zoning Ordinance 338 of the City.
      (3)   Any use, building or structure, existing prior to the effective
date of this Zoning Code and subsequent to the enactment of Zoning Ordinance
519 of the City, shall conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the
City, as they existed prior to this amendment, rather than to the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
      (4)   Any use, building or structure, existing prior to the effective
date of this Zoning Code and subsequent to the enactment of Zoning Ordinance
72-30 of the City, shall conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of
the City, as they existed prior to this amendment, rather than to the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (g)   Except as provided for in Section
1266.05, no part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading
space about a building required for the purpose of complying with this Zoning
Code shall be included as part of a yard, open space, off-street parking space
or loading space similarly required for another building.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
   (h)   Every principal building hereafter erected or structurally altered
shall be located on a single zoning lot, except as modified hereunder in R-5,
0, C, I, STUD and E Districts, more than one principal building per zoning lot
may be allowed if an administrative determination is made that all of the
following criteria are met:
      (1)   No building is closer to a street or to a property line than the
required and applicable front and rear zoning yards; and no buildings are
closer to one another than twice the distance of the minimum side yard if end-
to-end, nor closer than the sum of required front and rear yards if either
front-to-front, front-to-back or back-to-back on the zoning lot.
      (2)   The various buildings to be constructed or altered bear a close
functional relationship to each other, i. e. dissimilar land uses are not
involved, and future ownership by only one entity is virtually assured.
      (3)   It would be an extreme physical planning hardship to put each
structure on a separate zoning lot and still approach allowable zoning
densities.
      (4)   Similar uses elsewhere are customarily developed with more than one
principal structure.
   If administrative approval of more than one principal building on a single
zoning lot cannot be secured, the applicant for a permit may appeal to the
Planning Commission for approval, subject to procedures specified in Section
1268.05(e) or (g), as applicable.
(Ord. 88-8. Passed 5-10-88; Ord. 96-6. Passed 3-27-96.)
   (i)   No parcel of land described by metes and bounds nor any lot shall
hereafter be created which does not conform and meet the requirements of this
Zoning Code.
   (j)   No commercial or industrial establishment shall be permitted to create
a continuous curb cut or driveway approach along its right-of-way line.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
   (k)   All free-standing principal buildings in any "C," "S-PUD," "E" or "I"
District shall have a minimum floor area of 200 square feet.
(Ord. 87-4. Passed 2-10-87; Ord. 96-6. Passed 3-27-96.)
   (l)   The business activity of any commercial or industrial establishment
shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building, except as provided in
Section
1266.03(g).
   (m)   No livestock or poultry, quartered or housed within the corporate
limits, shall be kept and maintained so as to produce objectionable noise,
odor, destruction of property or health problems.
   (n)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the overall
layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any development,
building, structure or part thereof for which official approvals and required
permits have been legally granted before the enactment of this Zoning Code, the
construction of which, conforming with such plans, has been started within six
months of the enactment of this Zoning Code and completed in a normal manner
within a subsequent two-year period and not discontinued until completion,
except for reasons beyond the builder's control. All permits for which
construction has not begun within six months of the enactment or amendment of
this Zoning Code are hereby revoked and void.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
   (o)   Structures not elsewhere regulated by this Zoning Code shall be
located not closer than fifty feet from a front lot line nor closer than twenty
feet from a side lot line. However, if such structures are effectively screened
from view, from either another zoning lot or off-premises, by a fence or wall
six feet or less in height, such structures may be located anywhere on a zoning
lot other than required front or side yards.
(Ord. 83-24. Passed 9-13-83)
   (p)   No building or other development shall take place within a flood plain
without express permission from the City Engineer, if such building or
development will add impervious land area to the flood plain or subtract from
the amount of water accommodated by a given flood plain area. Indications of
flood plain boundaries may be inferred from U.S.G.S. maps, from existing or
previous zoning maps or by the existence of a watercourse. The burden of
determining floodplain boundaries shall lie with the owner of land proposed for
development.
(Ord. 87-16. Passed 6-9-87.)
   (q)   When a combination of permitted or conditionally permitted uses is
proposed for a given zoning lot, the stricter of applicable zoning provisions
for either use shall apply to the overall development.
   (r)   No real property in the City shall be transferred, nor shall a lease
therefore be made which exceeds 40 years, including extension periods, unless a
certificate of occupancy for said premises is issued by the City, prior to
closing or lease execution, acknowledging acceptance by the City of the use(s)
to be made of the property and stating there are no zoning or property
violations of the kind specified by Chapter
1266.07. This provision shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities
as defined in Section
1270.01(57.5) of the Zoning Code.

1264.02 EQ ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of environmental quality regulations
is to protect the quality of the urban environment in those locations where the
characteristics of the environment are distinctive and valuable and are
vulnerable to damage by development permitted under conventional zoning and
building regulations. Environmental quality regulations are required to protect
the public and the property owners in the District from:
      (1)   Blighting influences which might be allowed by existing
conventional zoning regulations;
      (2)   Damage to areas of high public investment which have added value to
the area;
      (3)   Unsafe buildings or unstable land which might be caused by
uncontrolled development;
      (4)   Damage or destruction of properties in historic districts;
      (5)   Damage to the economic value and efficiency of operation of
existing properties and/or new developments due to the interdependence of their
visual and functional relationships;
      (6)   Soil erosion and stream siltation; and
      (7)   Destruction of valuable trees and other vegetation.
   The location of all Environmental Quality (EQ) Districts shall be shown on
the Zoning Map of the City as ann overlay zone superimposed in specific areas
over existing zones. Adoption of EQ Districts shall be by action of Council
pursuant to the provisions of this section and other applicable law.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein and in other parts of this
Zoning Code, all regulations of the underlying zone districts shall apply to
and control property in an EQ District, provided, however, that in the case of
conflict between the provisions of an underlying zoning district and an EQ
District, the provisions of the EQ District shall prevail.
      (2)   Wherever applicable by the provisions of this chapter, the EQ
District shall supersede the administrative procedures pertaining to the
issuance of building permits within underlying zoning districts which require
the authorization of the Code Enforcement Officer or other boards, as provided
in the respective chapters of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Establishment of EQ Districts.
      (1)   Council may, from time to time, upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, create EQ Districts upon a finding of the following:
         A.   That the area under consideration for an EQ District exhibits the
definitional qualities as specified in
Chapter 1270; and
         B.   An area under consideration for an EQ District contains the
category qualification criteria as specified in the provisions of this section.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall prepare, pursuant to this section, a
Development Guidelines Report (DGR) for each EQ District established. The
Development Guidelines Report shall be recommended to Council which shall
adopt, revise or add to such guidelines and incorporate the same in the
ordinance establishing any specific EQ District. The DGR shall describe in
words and/or illustrations the special and distinctive environmental
characteristics which are to be protected and the development features which
will be reviewed for impact of a proposed development on the environment.
   (d)   Categories, Qualifications and Reasons for Protection.
      (1)   Environmental Quality Districts shall be classified by categories
according to the provisions and qualifications as described herein, and each
district type shall be shown on the Zoning Map of the City.
      (2)   Environmental Quality - High Public Investment (PI)-type shall be
identified as EQ-PI Districts.
         A.   Rationale for establishment of EQ-PI Districts is the fact that
the investment of substantial public funds, based on established public
policies or improvements in certain instances, requires the protection of such
investment over and above the protection provided by conventional building and
zoning regulations for the following reasons:
            1.    To prevent the recurrence of blight;
            2.    To prevent diminution of the effectiveness and value of the
public investments ;
            3.   To encourage coordinated development of parcels and structures
in accordance with efficient building design, multipurpose uses of sites,
unified off-street parking, trucking and service areas and internal pedestrian
linkages;
            4.   To achieve development which is integrated both functionally
and visually with the existing development which is to remain; and
            5.    To achieve the full benefit for the public and private owners
of the public improvements in the areas.
         B.   EQ-PI Districts shall contain evidence of significant public
investments which are made pursuant to a plan for renewal, revitalization or
other substantial physical improvements, adopted or approved by Council. EQ-PI
Districts shall contain three or more of the following public investment
qualification characteristics:
            1.   A public park, plaza, square, fountain or statuary;
            2.   Land cleared of blighting structures by urban redevelopment;
            3.    Public automobile parking garages or surface lots and other
similar public improvements;
            4.   Public pedestrian walkways;
            5.   Street tree plantings or other surface landscape treatment;
            6.   Private buildings erected on former redevelopment land in
accordance with proper design approval;
            7.   Substantial public investment in comprehensive urban design
planning for the purpose of guiding planned revitalization; and
            8.   Public and private investment in a community urban
redevelopment corporation pursuant to a plan adopted by Council which includes
the provision of planned revitalization activities in the proposed EQ-PI
District. Such plan shall specifically define the boundaries of such
redevelopment area.
   (e)   Development Permission; Exemptions. The following permits are subject
to review by category.
      (1)   Building permits not exempted by paragraph (e)(2) hereof shall not

   (g)   Modifications of Underlying District Regulations in EQ Districts.
      (1)   Regulations for land use, lot area, coverage, floor area, yard
requirements, parking, building, height, fences and landscaping for property in
an EQ District shall be determined by the underlying zoning and other
applicable regulations. Such regulations, with the exception of land use and

in any EQ District, upon a finding by the Commission that the modifications
will result in two or more of the following conditions:
         A.   Usable open space will be created for the public by the
dedication of public areas or space.
         B.   The restoration of plant materials will be accomplished by the
planting of trees, shrubs and ground covers.
         C.   Utility and other service distribution lines will be placed
underground.
         D.   An improvement in public safety will result.

      (2)   Upon having made the findings set forth in paragraph (g)(1) hereof,
the regulations set forth therein may be modified by the Commission up to the
following limits:
         A.   The gross dwelling unit density and floor area limitations of any
area proposed for development shall remain unchanged and conform to the basic
overall density and floor area limitation requirements of the underlying zoning
district. However, lot dimensions, building height, building setbacks and
front, side and rear yard requirements may be modified to provide for a more
functional desirable use of the property.
         B.   Height limitations may be removed, permitting high-rise
construction, provided such additional stories to dwelling structures do not:
            1.   Increase gross dwelling unit densities or floor area ratios as
set forth in the approved development plan;
            2.   Fail to result in appropriate reduction in building coverage
and adherence to the objectives set forth in this section; and
            3.   Adversely affect surrounding structures.
   (h)   Violations. No owner, lessee or tenant of land shall use, construct,
reconstruct, alter, maintain or divide any building, structure or land in

hereafter pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79. )
1264.03 S-PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The S-PUD Planned Unit Development District is intended to
provide permissive, voluntary and alternative zoning procedures for
development. Reasons for such zoning include:
      (1)   The provision of flexibility whereby land holdings greater than
three acres in size, under unified ownership, can be planned and developed as a
unit.
      (2)   A greater efficiency in the use of land and resources than is
achievable through conventional development.
      (3)   Facilitation of flexibility of design in order to take advantage of
natural features of land.
   (b)   Permitted Uses. Uses permitted in the S-PUD District are those
permitted by underlying zoning. Uses permitted elsewhere by this Zoning Code
also may be permitted if the Planning Commission and Council determine that
such uses are in harmony with adjacent neighborhoods, transportation facilities
and other community facilities.
   (c)   Design and Development Standards. Design and development standards
within an S-PUD District will normally be those associated with the most
restrictive Zoning Code standards applied to the same land uses elsewhere in
the City. Such standards may be altered to the extent that the Planning
Commission and Council are able to make determinations that surrounding
neighborhoods, as well as the general health, safety and welfare, will be
protected. Relaxation of otherwise applicable standards often will involve
trade-offs of open space or public amenities designed to provide a net positive
benefit to the community.
   (d)   Formal Plans,. Applicants are encouraged to engage in informal
consultations with staff and the Planning Commission prior to submission of
formal plans.
   (e)   Required Contents of the Site Development Plan. A proper site
development plan must be submitted at least two weeks before the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission to be considered on the next
agenda. The following elements will constitute a complete application:
      (1)   Evidence of ownership or equivalent control of the entirety of the
site;
      (2)   A base survey map of the site, to scale, showing boundary
dimensions, the genera topography, physical features and surrounding
thoroughfares;
      (3)   A site plan, showing lot lines, building outlines, off-street
parking spaces, pedestrian walkways, bicycle and automobile circulation and
special site development features;
      (4)   Engineering plans of sufficient detail for preliminary subdivision
approval and indicating that site grading, street improvements, storm drainage,
utility upgrades and extensions and other public facilities will meet City
standards;
      (5)   Building plans, to scale, including floor plans and exterior
elevations;
      (6)   Proposed restrictive covenants, homeowners' association proposals
and other legal documentation;
      (7)   Landscaping plans, including quantities, sizes and varieties of
landscaping; and
      (8)   A time schedule of the projected development, if the total
landholding is to be developed in stages or if construction is to extend beyond
a two-year time period.
   (f)   Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission may hold a public
hearing on the application, but will, in any case, make a report to City
Council after no more than two successive, regularly scheduled meetings
following timely receipt of a full application for S-PUD zoning. Such
Commission report to Council will recommend approval, modification or
disapproval and will offer reasons therefor. The Commission may explicitly
recommend special conditions relating to the planned unit development with
regard to the type and extent of public improvements, landscaping, building
styles, density or other development characteristics.
   (g)   City Council Action. City Council will consider the S-PUD application
and the accompanying report of the Planning Commission at a public hearing that
has been advertised by a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days
before said hearing date. The applicant may request a postponement of Council
consideration of the S-PUD application to allow the incorporation of changes
suggested by the Planning Commission. City Council may explicitly impose
special conditions relating to the planned unit development with regard to the
type and extent of public improvements, landscaping, building styles, density
or other development characteristics.
   (h)   Required Findings_. Both the Planning Commission and City Council will
only approve those S-PUD zoning applications which contain enough information
to allow them to make specific findings of fact, directly based upon the
evidence presented, that:
      (1)   The physical character of the site will be suitable for development
in the manner proposed without hazard to persons or property, on or off the
site, because of the probability of flooding, erosion or other dangers,
annoyances or inconveniences.
      (2)   The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to
carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development,
and the streets and driveways on the site will be adequate to efficiently and
safely serve the residents of the area as well as the traffic generated by uses
within the proposed development.
      (3)   The S-PUD District will be located in such a way, in relation to
sanitary sewers, storm and surface drainage systems, water supply systems and
police and fire protection facilities, that neither extension nor enlargement
of such systems will be required that will result in higher net public costs
than would development in forms generally permitted under existing zoning for
the area.
      (4)   Structures, parking areas, drives, roadways, walks, lighting and
appurtenant facilities will be located and designed to provide a high degree of
efficiency, safety, convenience and harmony within the development as well as
the utmost compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods.
      (5)   Proposed development can be substantially completed within the
period of time specified by the development application.
      (6)   The S-PUD District will be in conformity with Englewood
comprehensive planning, including land use and utility elements.
      (7)   Planning is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the City.
   (i)   Time Limits and Extensions. Following approval of the S-PUD
application by Council, an ordinance will be passed designating that the
subject property is now zoned "S-PUD Planned Unit Development". S-PUD zoning
approval by said ordinance shall become null and void, and the land shall
revert to its former zoning classification, if:
      (1)   Within one year of zoning approval, a final subdivision plat, if
applicable, for at least the first section, has not been recorded by Montgomery
County.
      (2)   A building permit, within at least the first section, has not been
secured within one year of final plat recording.
   Existing landscaping, acting as screening of a project site from surrounding
sites, shall not be removed until final landscaping and screening is to be
installed. Unless the City Engineer and the Community Development Director
determine that there is a sound development reason for delay, all approved
landscaping and screening must be installed the earlier of six months from the
date of S-PUD approval by Council or before issuance of a building permit. If
delays in landscaping and screening installation are approved, subsequent
occupancy of a building may be delayed until such approved screening has been
installed.
   An extension of time limits or minor modifications of approved plans may be
approved by the Planning Commission. Such approval shall be given upon a
finding of the purpose and necessity for such extension or minor modification
and evidence of reasonable effort toward the accomplishment of approved plans.
Proposed changes not deemed minor by the Planning Commission shall necessitate
review by both the Planning Commission and City Council, in the same format as
if a new S-PUD District were being proposed.
   (j)   Subdivision Standards. Unless otherwise addressed by the Planning
Commission or City Council, design standards for the proposed subdivision of
land shall meet minimum standards of the City relating to the platting of land.

1264.04 S-PCD PLANNED COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 1264.04 was repealed by Ordinance 96-6, passed March
27, 1996.)
1264.05 S-CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of Central Business District
regulations is the recognition and maintenance of a unique community focal
point. Historically, the Central Business District has housed various mixed
residential and commercial land uses. Because of historical precedent, the
historical significance of structures designed for mixed use, and the intent to
keep an older area of the community viable, central business district
regulations have been developed. Even though mixed uses may be allowed, it is
the intent of these regulations to assure a predominantly nonresidential,
commercial focus for this zoning district.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   Central Business District zoning shall exist as an overlay zone,
superimposed in a specific area over existing zoning classifications. Adoption
and modification of a Central Business District zone shall be by action of
Council, pursuant to the same regulations applying to the adoption or
alteration of any other zoning district.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided herein, all regulations of the
underlying zoning districts shall apply to and control property in an S-CBD
zone, provided, however, that in the case of conflict between the provisions of
an underlying zoning district and an S-CBD zone, the provisions of the S-CBD
zoning shall prevail.
   (c)   Boundaries. Central Business District zoning may be utilized within
all areas zoned "C-3 Community Commercial" or "0-1 Office", provided that such
areas are located east of Beckenham Road, south of Herr Street and north of
Overlook Street, and also including such identically zoned areas lying east of
Main Street, north of Tate Avenue.
   (d)   Permitted Uses.Pursuant to review and approval of design elements by
the Administrative Board for Planning and Zoning Appeals, following the same
administrative procedures as are prescribed in approving conditionally
permitted uses, the following development plans may be allowed in an S-CBD
zone:
      (1)   Residential units, where residential land use has been the
predominant land use on a given zoning lot within six months of seeking
expansion or redevelopment approvals, or where a non-retailing, non-commercial
land use has been the predominant land use of a given zoning lot within six
months of seeking redevelopment approvals, and where an R-6 zoning standard can
be maintained for required yards, off-street parking and other development
aspects.
      (2)   Residential units at the second story or higher building elevation,
or behind the street-level commercial, retailing or office use principally
permitted by underlying zoning, provided:
         A.   Such residential units do not create a greater demand for off
street parking, with reference to standards set forth in Section
1266.05 of this Zoning Code, unless such standards can be met on-site.
         B.   Such residential units do not share common areas with each other,
or with non-residential uses, and provided that residential and non-residential
uses are self-contained and separated by fire walls and/or other partitions as
prescribed by applicable building and health codes.
      (3)   Commercial redevelopment areas where retailing and office space are
proposed to meet a planned thematic standard, where the area to be developed is
at least one-acre in size. The approval procedure for an S-CBD commercial
redevelopment area shall be the same as for SPUD zoning, as specified in
Section
1264.03.

occupants of the zoning lot where they are located, must be of monopole
construction, with a smooth and uniform exterior, without supporting guy wires
or supporting ancillary apparatus. Mounts, antennas and associated equipment
buildings shall be painted a uniform color, approved by the Planning
Commission. Mounts and antennas shall not display a bright and flashing beacon

feet and all other property line setbacks of at least fifty feet. A plan of
landscaping shall be included with the application for approval.
      (4)   When an accessory use, notwithstanding other standards that might
also apply, such personal wireless service facilities shall meet applicable
yard and setback regulations for accessory structures in the zone in which they
are located, but in no case shall such facilities be closer than six feet from
any property line. When allowed as an accessory use, personal wireless service
facilities will not be counted against the limiting number of other accessory
structures which are permitted on a given piece of property.
      (5)   Setback requirements shall be in one of two categories:
         A.   If located within 650 feet of an interstate highway, personal
wireless service facilities may be located in side or rear yards, outside
existing easement areas, at least six feet from the nearest property line, but
irrespective of otherwise applicable yard offset requirements, provided that
the distance of such facilities from the nearest non-interstate roadway shall
be equal to at least the height of the mount and antennas in combination, and
the distance of such personal wireless service facilities from the nearest
existing or potential dwelling unit, by reference to existing lots of record or
proposed plats, shall be equal to at least the height of the mount and antennas
in combination.
         B.   If not located within 650 feet of an interstate highway, or if

      (7)   Such communication mounts as are approved and built shall be
capable of structurally supporting the antennas of the applicant, as well as
two other service providers. The applicant shall agree to permit use of the
personal wireless service facilities mount by other communication service
providers on reasonable terms.
      (8)   Unless parking space is available within fifty feet on the same
zoning lot where personal wireless service facilities are located, such
facilities shall have a paved access drive leading thereto, with a paved
parking area sufficient for at least one service vehicle.
      (9)   Setback requirements specified above may be waived by the Planning
Commission, in whole or in part, for those personal wireless service facilities
that utilize existing conforming structures as their base or that have their
appearance disguised in an approved manner.
      (10)   The owner(s) of personal wireless service facilities shall, upon
request of the City Manager, file a declaration with the office of the City
Manager as to the continuing operation of every facility installed subject to
these standards and provisions and shall remove an obsolete facility within
twelve months of ceasing its use.
      (11)   Permits for personal wireless service facilities shall
automatically expire if a report is not filed with the office of the City
Manager within ninety days of being requested by a duly authorized
representative of the City, said report attesting to the structural integrity
of said facilities. Such reports may be required as often as every ten years or
upon suspicion of structural damage by some exogenous physical force.
      (12)   There shall be no advertising, emblems, markings or other
indications of company or organization affiliation or announcement, whether
related to service providers using the mount and/or antennas or related to
other interests of any kind. The exception, which can only be allowed by the

1266.05 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   General Requirements.
      (1)   All buildings and structures erected and all land uses shall
provide necessary off-street parking or loading facilities as required
hereinafter for the use thereof and all applications for a building permit
shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned,
showing any off-street parking or loading spaces to be provided in compliance
with the requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Except in the case of dwellings, no parking area provided hereunder
shall be less than 1, 000 square feet in area. In C-4, E-1 and R-5 zones,
except in the case of one, two or three-family dwellings, no off-street parking
may utilize more than one-third of the required front yard setback.
      (3)   Whenever a building addition results in an increase in the number
of units used to measure required off-street parking spaces, and such addition
creates a need for an increase of more than ten percent of the required off-
street parking spaces, additional off street parking shall be provided on the
basis of the increase in the number of such units of measurement, except that
in the case of additional dwelling units created by conversion of an existing
dwelling, two off-street parking spaces shall be required for each additional
dwelling unit created.
      (4)   Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces in existence on the
effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979)
shall not be reduced in number, unless they already exceed the requirements of
this section for equivalent new construction. If so, the spaces shall not be
reduced below the number required herein for such equivalent new construction.
      (5)   When fifty percent or more of a block is occupied by commercial
structures and is devoted to business on the effective date of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979), the off-street parking space
requirements outlined in subsection (c) hereof shall be reduced to that amount
of parking which can be provided upon the land available for development in
such parking use.
      (6)   Off-street parking spaces for different buildings and/or uses may
be provided collectively in any zoning district in which separate off-street
parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted, provided the
total number of joint spaces is not less than the sum of the separate
requirements for each use and provided that a written agreement for joint usage
is properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form
and execution by the Director of Law and filed with the application for a
building permit or certificate of occupancy.
   Not more than fifty percent of the parking spaces required for theaters and
places of amusement and up to 100 percent of the parking spaces required for a
church or school may be provided and used jointly by banks, offices, retail
stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar uses not normally
open, used or operated during the same hours as the theaters, places of
amusement, churches or schools. However, written agreement necessary for
assuring the retention of such purpose shall be properly drawn and executed by
the Director of Law and filed with the application for a building permit.
      (7)   The use of off-street parking spaces for residents and visitors in
any "R" District shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or
commercial vehicles not more than five tons in gross weight owned by occupants
of the dwelling units.
   The location of off-street parking spaces shall be as follows:
   District               Location
   A-1               On the same zoning lot
   R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4,
    O-1 and S-PUD         On the same zoning lot
   C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4         Within 300 feet of the nearest principal
structure
   I-1               Within 1, 000 feet of the nearest principal structure, but
not in an "R" or "S-PUD" District.
   No parking facilities accessible to a "C" Zoning District use shall be
located in an "A,It 'IR" or "S-PUD" District, except where authorized by the
Board of Zoning Appeals as prescribed hereinafter. Accessory off-street parking
spaces, provided elsewhere than on the same zoning lot, shall be in the same
possession, either by deed or long term lease, as the property owner of the
zoning lot.
   (b)   Specific Requirements.
      (1)   Access.
         A.   Parking spaces and lots shall be designed with appropriate means
of vehicular access to a street or alley in such a manner as will least
interfere with the movement of traffic. Any driveway or curb cut in any
district shall be in accordance with appropriate ordinances of the City.
         B.   Proposed driveways for multifamily and nonresidential land uses
on other than local streets shall conform to the following diagrams, unless the
City Engineer and the Community Development Director agree that appropriate
safeguards exist without reference to such standards and agree that an adequate
site design will result from an alternative design plan. The standards in Table
1 shall be referred to by the Administrative Board for Planning and Zoning
Appeals in determining the suitability of proposed conditional uses.

         C.   The distances shown by spacing diagrams A and B hereof shall be
applicable to all multifamily and nonresidential properties where a conditional
use is applied for; a change of principally permitted uses takes place; or a
use is re-established after abandonment for the time periods specified for
nonconforming uses by Section
1268.08.

      (2)   Computation of required spaces. When determination of the number of
required off-street parking spaces results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded, and
fractions over one-half shall be interpreted as one parking space. Parking
spaces within a garage structure and on a driveway (exclusive of the sidewalk
and apron) may be computed as off-street parking spaces.
      (3)   Parking space dimensions. Required off-street parking spaces,
perpendicular to an access aisle, shall comply with either of two standards.
The common standard shall be a parking space ten feet wide by twenty feet in
depth. However, parking spaces nine feet wide by nineteen feet in depth shall
be allowed for churches, schools, hospitals and all principally permitted uses
in an Industrial Zoning District and light industrial uses allowed in a C-
4 Zoning District. Parking spaces not perpendicular to an access aisle shall
meet a workable-size planning standard approved by the Code Enforcement
Officer. Parking space dimensions shall be calculated exclusive of access
drives, aisles, ramps, columns and work areas. Aisles serving perpendicular
vehicular parking spaces shall be at least twenty-four feet in width. Aisle
widths serving non-perpendicular parking spaces shall be approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer. Under all circumstances, each parking space shall have a
gross area of 300 square feet.
      (4)   Separation.
         A.   All unenclosed off-street parking areas shall be separated from
public rights of way by a landscaped area of at least ten feet in width.
         B.   All unenclosed off-street parking areas shall be separated from
principal buildings by a six-inch high curb so as to maintain a clear
unobstructed three-foot corridor between the building and the parked vehicles.
         C.   No driveways or parking areas shall be closer than five feet to
adjacent property lines. Off-street parking areas serving more than one
residential unit and serving all nonresidential uses shall be provided with
six-inch high curbing surrounding the parking area and drives leading thereto),
unless this requirement is modified, in whole or in part, by the City Engineer
for site drainage purposes. This standard for curbing can also be met by the
provision of a continuous stone wall, landscaped earthwork or other barrier
judged by the City Engineer to be as safe and efficient as the continuous
curbing standard. In addition, off street parking areas of over 1,000 gross
square feet, located adjacent to residential uses, shall be separated from
residential lots by landscaping between paved areas and residential property
lines.
         D.   No unenclosed off-street parking or driveway area of over 30, 000
square feet in a "C-2," "C-3," "C-4" or "I-1" Zoning District shall be closer
than fifty feet to any lot in an "R,""S-PUD" or "A-1" Zoning District.
      (5)   Landscaping and screening. All parts of open space off-street
parking areas which are usable, either for parking or for traffic, shall be
paved or landscaped with plantings of grass, flowers, shrubs and/or trees,
which shall be continuously maintained. Such landscaping shall be in conformity
with
Chapter 1224. All unenclosed off-street parking areas of over 1,000 square feet
shall be screened from one and two-family residential dwellings on adjacent
lots by an effective screen as described below. When any open off-street
parking area of 1,000 square feet in area or larger is used for any
nonresidential purpose containing more than two parking spaces, if not
separated from an "R" District by a dedicated street, an effective buffer or
screen, consisting of a solid wall, wooden fence or view-obscuring dense
planting of evergreen shrubs, shall be provided at the lot line to protect the
privacy of the adjoining residential uses. Such wall, fence or hedge shall be
not less than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition. The
space between such wall, fence or hedge and the lot line adjoining the premises
or the front lot line facing the premises in any "R" District shall be
landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in
good condition.
      (6)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking or
loading area shall be equipped with suitable shielding or be so arranged as to
prevent glare or reflective lighting of adjoining public or private property.
The lighting shall be subject to the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer.
      (7)   Signs. No signs shall be displayed in any parking area within any
Residential District, except as may be necessary for the orderly use of the
parking facilities and limited to two square feet in surface area.
      (8)   Surfacing and striping. All open, off-street parking areas shall be
improved with a compacted stone base, not less than four inches thick, surfaced
with not less than one and one-half inches of asphaltic concrete or some other
comparable all-weather dustless material. A parking space in any "C" or "I"
District shall be properly marked by durable paint in stripes a minimum of four
inches wide and extending the length of the parking space.
      (9)   Drainage. Adequate storm water drainage facilities shall be
installed in order to ensure that storm water does not flow onto abutting
property or rights of way in such a way or quantity as to detrimentally affect
the use of such properties or rights of way.
   (c)   Specific Off-Street Parking Space Requirements. Off-street parking
spaces shall be provided in accordance with the schedule outlined below. The
off-street parking and loading requirements for any use not specified in this
Zoning Code shall be the same as for a similar permitted use in the particular
zoning district.

1266.07 PRE-SALE PROPERTY TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   No owner of any real estate premises within the City shall transfer
legal or equitable ownership of that premises without first obtaining a pre-
sale inspection of the exterior of the premises and a certificate of occupancy,
pursuant to this chapter. The purpose of the inspection is to enable the City
to identify whether any violations of this zoning code or any other applicable
codes, ordinances, or regulations exist on the premises, such that necessary
repairs may be identified and required prior to transfer.
   (b)   Application for a pre-sale inspection shall be made by the owner of
the premises or their representative on such form, and accompanied by an
administrative fee, as may be prescribed from time to time by the Code
Enforcement Officer.
   (c)   Within seven business days after an application for pre-sale
inspection is submitted, the code official shall complete the inspection and
compile a list of any conditions requiring repair prior to transfer. The code
official may extend this deadline for successive seven day periods if such
delay is the result of circumstances beyond their control.
   (d)   No owner is obligated to consent to the pre-sale inspection of
premises required by this section, and no criminal penalty shall arise from any
such refusal of consent. If the owner of the premises refuses to consent to the
pre-sale inspection, then the code official may either:
      (1)   Appear before any court of competent jurisdiction and request an
administrative search warrant to allow an exterior inspection of the premises.
The application for the search warrant shall specify the basis upon which the
warrant is being sought, together with any evidence supporting such basis, and
shall include a statement that the inspection will be limited to determining
whether there are violations of this zoning code or any other applicable codes,
ordinances, or regulations existing on the premises; or
      (2)   Perform a plain-view exterior inspection of the premises. In
performing any such plain-view exterior inspection, the code official shall
limit their inspection to a visual assessment of the exterior of the premises
and shall not enter onto the curtilage of the premises while performing the
inspection.
   (e)   If a search warrant is issued pursuant to this section, no owner,
occupant, or representative thereof shall fail or refuse, upon presentation of
the warrant, to properly permit entry onto the premises by the code official or
his duly authorized designee for the purpose of performing the inspection and
consistent with the terms of the warrant. Failure or refusal to permit entry
onto the premises following presentation of a warrant pursuant to this section
shall be a violation of this zoning code punishable pursuant to Section
1268.99.
   (f)   Upon completion of the inspection and satisfactory repair of any
conditions identified by the code official pursuant to this section, the code
official shall issue a certificate of occupancy for the premises. Such
certificate shall be valid for a period of 180 days from the date of issuance.
If no transfer of the premises has occurred within that period, then a new
inspection shall be required.

application of one or more of the owners or authorized representatives of the
owners of property within the area proposed to be changed.
   (c)   Council shall favorably consider an application for a zoning text
amendment, a change of zoning district on the Official Zoning District Map or a
reclassification of property, only if the request for a change of zoning can be
justified on one of the following grounds

      (2)   An accordance with, or more appropriate conformity to, the
Englewood Comprehensive Land Use Plan and its relative priorities;
      (3)   A substantial change in area conditions; or
      (4)   A legitimate requirement for additional land area for the
particular zoning district.
   In the case of a change to the Official Zoning District Map, Council shall
not consider favorably any petition which would result in a total contiguous
area (separated only by streets and excluding the area of streets) of less than
the acreage minimums specified as the minimum size requirement for zoning
districts in Section

(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79. )
1268.04 AUTHORITY OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   The Code Enforcement Officer shall administer and enforce this Zoning Code,
including the following:
   (a)   Interpret the provisions of this Zoning Code (text and map). In
interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, the provisions
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of health,
safety, morals, convenience or the general welfare.
   (b)   Receive and process applications for zoning permits where new
construction is to be carried out.
      (1)   Prior to the beginning of construction pertaining to the erection,
construction, reconstruction, moving, alteration or addition to any building or
structure, a zoning permit shall be secured from the Code Enforcement Officer
by the owner or his or her agent. The zoning permit shall state that the
proposed project, as shown by the plans and specifications filed with the Code
Enforcement Officer, is in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Every application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by plans
in duplicate, drawn to scale in black line or blueprint, showing the actual
shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon or to be changed in its use,
in whole or in part; the exact location, size, elevation and height of any
building or structure to be erected or altered; the existing and intended use
of each building or structure or part thereof; the number of families or
housekeeping units the building is designed to accommodate; when no buildings
are involved, the location of the present use and the proposed use to be made
of the lot; and such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring
lots as may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this
Zoning Code.
      One copy of such plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans
have been approved by the Code Enforcement Officer, together with such zoning
permit as may be granted. All dimensions shown on these plans relating to the
location and size of the lot to be built upon shall be based on an actual
survey. The lot and the location of the building thereon shall be staked out on
the ground before construction is started.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a zoning permit, such zoning permit shall be posted
in a prominent place on the premises prior to and during the period of
erection, reconstruction, enlargement or moving. Before a zoning permit is
issued for the erection, moving, alteration, enlargement or occupancy of any
building or structure or use of such premises, the plans and intended use shall
indicate conformity in all respects to the provisions of this Zoning Code and
such zoning permit shall be issued within ten days, provided the proposed
activity is in accordance with this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Receive and process applications for certificates of occupancy where
no new construction is to be carried out or where new construction has just

building or structure, or part thereof, and prerequisite to the continued
occupancy of a newly altered, reconstructed, enlarged or relocated building or
structure, or prerequisite to the continued occupancy of a reoccupied
commercial building, a certificate of occupancy shall be secured from the Code
Enforcement Officer by the owner or his or her agent. The certificate of
occupancy shall state that the completed improvement, relocation or
reoccupation has been inspected by the Code Enforcement Officer and has been
found to be in compliance with this Zoning Code. In the case of existing
buildings and structures, the need for a new certificate of occupancy shall
exist whenever space is occupied that was not previously occupied, whenever the
use made of a given space changes with reference to a major category of zoning
activity listed by the Zoning Code or whenever nonresidential activity ceases
and is later re-established.
      (2)   Upon written request from the owner or tenant, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall issue a certificate of occupancy for any building or premises
existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed
November 13, 1979), certifying after inspection the extent and kind of use made
of the building or premises and whether such use conforms to the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Prior to the reoccupation or re-use of any lot, building or
structure in a previously established use, when such reoccupation or re-use is
of a different character or type than that of the previously established use, a
certificate of occupancy shall be secured from the Code Enforcement Officer by
the owner or his or her agent. The certificate of occupancy shall state that
the extent and kind of use proposed to be made of the lot, building or
structure conforms to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Conduct inspections of buildings, structures and uses of land to
determine compliance with this Zoning Code and, in the case of any violation,
notify in writing the person or persons responsible, specifying the nature of
the violation and ordering appropriate corrective action. No person shall
refuse to grant the Code Enforcement Officer access, at reasonable hours
pursuant to notice, for the purpose of inspecting any building, structure or
use of land.

reclassifications of property; and
   (g)   Prepare and submit an annual report to Council on the administration
of this Zoning Code, setting forth such statistical data and information as may
be of interest and value in advancing and furthering the purpose of this Zoning

APPEALS)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 3.10 of the City Charter, which provided for the
appointment of a Board of Zoning Appeals, was repealed by the voters on
November 4, 1980. The functions of the Board are now performed by the
Administrative Board for Planning and Zoning Appeals, under authority of
Section 3.09 of the City Charter, as amended on November 4, 1980. This Section
1268.05 has been amended to conform to new Section 3.09 of the City Charter.)
   (a)   Composition and Officers. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired
term only. Members may be removed for cause by Council upon written charges and
after a public hearing within thirty days after the filing of such charges.
   (b)   Meetings and Records. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call
of the President and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
President or, in his or her absence, the Vice-President, may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open
to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the
vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations, testimony and
official actions, all of which shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of
Council and shall be a public record.
   (c)   Filing Procedure. Written application for a variance, conditional use
permit or special exception shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer,
who shall transmit the same, together with all the scale plot drawings, plans,
specifications and other papers pertaining to the application, to the Board.
Written application for an administrative appeal shall be made directly to the
Board, as well as to the Code Enforcement Officer.
   (d)   General Powers.
      (1)   In exercising its powers, the Board shall act in strict accordance
with State law and the provisions of this Zoning Code. The Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify an administrative decision or zoning
requirement, and to that end the Board shall have all powers of the Code
Enforcement Officer and the Planning Commission from whom the appeal is taken.
The Board may impose conditions regarding location, character or other features
of the proposed lot or building. The Board shall not, however, permit any use
which is not a permitted use in a particular zoning district. Appeals from the
decision of the Board may be heard by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (2)   The Board has the specific power to make decisions on appeals of
administrative decisions, variances, special exceptions and conditional uses as
outlined below in the following subsections.
      (3)   All applications made to the Board of variances, conditional use
permits, special exceptions and administrative appeals shall be in writing and
shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer at least fourteen days prior
to the meeting at which they are to be heard. Each application shall refer to
the specific provisions of this Zoning Code and shall set forth exactly a clear
description of land involved, the interpretation that is claimed, the details
of the variance proposed to be granted, the use for which a conditional use
permit is sought, the reasons justifying the special exception and as the case
may be.
      The Board shall decide all applications and appeals within sixty days
after completion of the hearing. Such decision shall be binding upon the Code
Enforcement Officer and/or the Planning Commission. The terms and conditions of
the decision by the Board shall be incorporated into any zoning permit or
certificate of occupancy whenever such is authorized by the Board.
      The presence of three members shall constitute a quorum. A concurring
vote of three members of such Board shall be necessary to reverse an order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Code Enforcement Officer or
Commission to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass by this Zoning Code or to grant a variance from the
requirements of this Zoning Code. The Board shall act by resolution and a copy
of each resolution duly adopted shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of
Council.
      (4)   Every special exception, variance or conditional use permit allowed
or granted by the Board shall expire and be of no force or effect after the
expiration of twelve months from the date thereof, unless the beneficiary of
such variance, conditional use permit or special exception has actually, within
such period, put the subject property to the purpose for which such variance,
conditional use permit or special variance has been granted or allowed.
   (e)   Specific Powers Relative to Administrative Errors (Administrative
Appeal). The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is
an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Code
Enforcement Officer in the enforcement of this Zoning Code. Any person claiming
to be aggrieved by any order, requirement or decision made by the Code
Enforcement Officer may appeal to the Board. Such appeal shall be taken within
twenty days of the date of the decision by filing with the Code Enforcement
Officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Code Enforcement Officer shall transmit to
the Board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken. Normally, such review by the Board is limited to
alleged errors in interpretation of this Zoning Code.
      An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Code Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her,
that by reason of the facts stated in the application a stay would, in his or
her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
Code Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.
   (f)   Specific Powers Relative to Conditional Uses.
      (1)   Application for a conditional use permit shall be made by the
property owner or agent thereof to the Board, on a form prescribed by the City
at least fourteen days prior to the meeting. The application fee for a
conditional use permit shall, except as hereinafter provided, be in such amount
as is prescribed by resolution of Council. The application under this section
shall be accompanied by maps and drawings necessary to demonstrate that
conditions set forth herein will be fulfilled. The Board is authorized to issue
a conditional use permit to permit conditional uses as indicated in Section
1266.01, provided that they meet all the conditions for approval specified in
that section.
      (2)   The purpose of a conditional use permit is to allow a proper
integration into the community of uses which may only be suitable in specific
locations within certain zoning districts or only if such uses are designed or
laid out in a particular manner on the site. A conditional use permit shall be
required for all uses listed as conditional uses. in the district regulations
and in Section
1266.01(a).
      (3)   In considering an application for a conditional use, the Board must
make an affirmative finding that:
         A.   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a district where
such use may be permitted.
         B.   The conditions for approval of a conditional use as set forth in
Section
1266.01have been met.
         C.   The proposed conditional use, in addition, meets all the
requirements specified for the zoning district in which it is located.
         In addition, the Board shall give due regard to the nature and
condition of all adjacent uses and structures and, in issuing a conditional use
permit, the Board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to
location, design, siting, maintenance and operation of the use, in addition to
those expressly provided in Section
1266.01for the particular use, as may be necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and in the public interest. Before issuing a conditional
use permit, the Board shall determine that the establishment, maintenance and
operation of a proposed conditional use is generally consistent with the
provisions of the Englewood Comprehensive Land Use Plan and will not be
detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort or general welfare of persons
or property in the City.
      (4)   If the nature of the conditional use is closely related to one of
those listed in Section
1266.01(a), the applicant may apply for a conditional use permit for the
conditional use which most closely relates to the primary use, provided that
the requirements of all related uses are met.
An existing lawful use, which is listed herein as a conditional use and which
is located in a district in which such conditional use may be permitted, shall
be considered a conforming use.
Any expansion of such conditional use involving the enlargement of the
buildings, structures and land area devoted to such use shall be subject to the
procedure described in this section.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
   (g)   Specific Powers Relative to Special Exceptions.
      (1)   Application for a special exception shall be made by the property
owner or agent to the Board on a form prescribed by the City at least fourteen
days prior to the meeting date. A special exception may be granted to allow the
following situations:
         A.   To permit extension of a zoning district where its boundary line
divides a lot held in single ownership on the effective date of this Zoning
Code
(Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979);
         B.   To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of
premises for public utility purposes;
         C.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which
has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy to the
extent of more than sixty percent of its reasonable value where the Board finds
some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming
use and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to
continue a monopoly;
         D.   To permit the one-time enlargement of existing nonconforming
buildings upon the same lot occupied by such building or upon an adjoining lot,
provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot on which such
nonconforming building existed at the time such buildings became nonconforming,
and provided that such enlargement is necessary and incidental to the existing
use of such building, and further provided that such enlargement conforms to
the height, yard and area requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located where such enlargements are not detrimental to present and potential
surrounding uses and will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this Zoning Code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
City;
         E.   To vary parking and loading and unloading regulations whenever
the character or use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full
provision of parking and loading and unloading facilities or when such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience;
         F.   To permit the substitution of one nonconforming use for another,
where the Board finds evidence that the proposed use will be less detrimental
to the neighborhood than the existing use and where there is substantial
evidence that the structure to house the proposed substitution is ill-suited by
architectural and physical design to either a permitted or conditional use in a
given zoning district; and
         G.   To allow more than one principal structure on a single zoning lot
if the provisions of Section
1260.03(h)(2) to (4) are met.
      (2)   Before any special exception shall be issued, the Board shall make
written findings certifying compliance with the specific rules governing
individual special exceptions and determine that satisfactory provision and
arrangement have been made concerning the following, where applicable:
         A.   Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon,
with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience,
traffic flow and control and access in case of fire or catastrophe;
         B.   Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with
particular attention to the items in subparagraph (2)A. hereof and the
economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on adjoining
properties and properties generally in the district;
         C.   Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items
in subparagraphs (2)A. and B. hereof;
         D.   Utilities, with reference to location, availability and
compatibility;
         E.   Screening and buffering, with reference to type, dimensions and
character;
         F.   Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting, with reference to
glare, traffic safety, economic effect and compatibility and harmony with
properties in the district;
         G.   Required yards, open space and other requirements of these
Codified Ordinances, especially
Chapter 1266.
         H.    General compatibility with adjacent property and other property
in the district.
(Ord. 88-8. Passed 5-10-88.)
   (h)   Specific Powers Relative to Variances. The Board shall have the power
to authorize upon appeal in specific cases, filed as hereinbefore provided,
such variances from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code as will
not be contrary to the public interest, but only in the case of peculiar
conditions, involving irregular, abnormally narrow, shallow or steep lots or
other unusual conditions, whereby strict and literal application of such
provisions or requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or
buildings involved. No variance from the strict application of any provision of
this Zoning Code shall be granted by the Board, unless it finds that all of the
following facts and conditions exist:
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to any
other land, building or structure within the same zoning district.
      (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same zoning district under the provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Special conditions and circumstances shall not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (4)   Granting the variance requested will provide the minimum necessary
relief to alleviate the hardship.
      (5)   Granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
      (6)   The proposed variance will not constitute a change of zoning
district, including a variation in use, on the Official Zoning District Map. In
no case shall the Board approve a variance for a use which is not a permitted
use in the zoning district in which the property, building or structure is
located.
   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the
same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land, structures or
buildings in other districts, shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
   Following disapproval by the Board of an application or request for a
variance from the literal interpretation of this Zoning Code, no subsequent
application requesting the same variance shall be filed by any applicant,
whether he or she is the same person, firm or corporation, until the expiration
of twelve months after the original or subsequent disapproval.
   The Board shall cause to be made a record of all its proceedings, setting
forth its reasons for its decisions. Such record, immediately following the
Board's decision, shall be filed in the offices of the Board and the Planning
Commission and shall be open to public inspection.
   (i)   Appeals Procedure. Appeals from the Board in its decisions on
administrative error, variances, conditional uses, special exceptions and
related matters shall be to the Court of Common Pleas of the County, as
provided by the statutes of the State.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79. )
1268.06 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (a)   Defined. As used in this chapter, "public hearing" means a regularly
scheduled hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals at which the applicant,
City representatives, other interested persons and the public in general are
invited, by reason of publication of notice of public hearing pursuant to the
provisions of subsection (b) hereof to make presentations in the matter under
consideration.
   (b)   Notice of Hearing. A public hearing shall be held by the Board when it
deems such public hearing necessary to the public interest. If the Board orders
a public hearing on an application for a conditional use permit, special
exception or variance, notice thereof shall be given by mailing notice to all
owners of property as shown on the last adopted tax roll, within 200 feet
adjacent to and abutting the parcel involved or across the public right of way
therefrom, such mailing to be at least five days prior to the public hearing,
or by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation printed and
published in the City, not less than seven days prior to the public hearing.
Notice may also be given by such other means as the Board deems appropriate.
Failure of any person, other than the applicant, to receive notice of any
public hearing shall in no way affect the validity of action taken.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79; Ord. 86-24. Passed 12-9-86.)

of land, as listed on the tax duplicate, written notice of the hearing may be
mailed by the Commission by first class mail at least five days before the date
of the hearing to all owners of property within 200 feet contiguous to, and

that may be specified by Council.
   (f)   Recommendation by Planning Commission. Within forty-five days after
holding its public hearing, if held, or within seventy-five days after adoption
of a resolution by Council or the filing of an application by at least one

1268.08 NONCONFORMITIES; BUILDINGS, USES AND LOTS.
   (a)   Intent. Within the districts established by this Zoning Code or
amendments that may later be adopted, there exist buildings and structures,
uses of land and structures and lots of record which were lawful before this
Zoning Code was passed or amended (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979),
but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of
this Zoning Code or a future amendment. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival.
   Nonconforming uses are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a
nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use or structure and land in
combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979) by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by
the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in
the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code
shall be deemed to require a change in plans, construction or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Code, (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979)
and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently.
Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or
removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work is
carried on diligently.
   (b)   Nonconforming Uses of Buildings and Structures or of Structures and
Premises in Combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures with a
replacement cost of one thousand dollars ($1, 000) or more, or of a structure
and premises in combination, exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979) that
would not be allowed in the district under the provisions of this Zoning Code,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains lawful, subject to the
following:
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a building or structure lawfully existing
upon the effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November
13, 1979) may be maintained and may be repaired. Any nonconforming building or
structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
      (2)   A structure nonconforming as to use, height, yard requirements or
lot area shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner, unless such
structure, including such addition or enlargement, is made to conform to the
use, height, yard and area requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located.
      (3)   Any structure or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the zoning district and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed.
      (4)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or
in part to any other location on the lot, unless every portion of such building
or structure is made to conform to all the regulations of the zoning district
in which it is located.
      (5)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure or part
thereof has been discontinued for a period of twelve consecutive months (in a
twenty-four month period), such use shall not, after being discontinued or
abandoned, be re-established, and the use of the premises thereafter shall be
in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district.
      (6)   Any nonagricultural building or structure containing a
nonconforming use, other than a one-family dwelling use, which is damaged by
explosion, fire, flood, wind or other act of God to the extent of sixty percent
or more of its replacement value immediately prior to damage, shall not be
repaired or reconstructed except as provided in this Zoning Code. In the event
that the Code Enforcement Officer's estimate of the extent of damage or
replacement value is not acceptable to the applicant for the building permit to
repair or reconstruct such building or structure, the applicant may appeal to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (7)   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired or rebuilt, except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses of Land (or Land with Minor Structures Only).Where,
at the time of passage of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November
13, 1979), lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this Zoning Code, and where such use involves no
individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars
($1, 000), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided that:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of
this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979).
      (2)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than ninety days in a twelve-month period, any subsequent use of
such land shall conform to the requirements specified in this Zoning Code for
the zoning district in which such land is located.
      (3)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
   (d)    Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record on the effective date of
this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November 13, 1979), notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code. Each lot must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in
the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. A variance of yard requirements
shall be obtained only through action of the Board.
   (e)    Contiguous Nonconforming Lots in Common Ownership. Where two or more
contiguous nonconforming lots of record are in common ownership and are of such
size to constitute at least one conforming zoning lot, such lots or portions
thereof shall be so joined, developed and used for the purpose of forming an
effective and conforming lot or lots. Such contiguous nonconforming lots in
common ownership shall be considered as being maintained in common ownership
after the effective date of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 79-56, passed November
13, 1979) for zoning purposes.
   (f)    Conditionally Permitted Uses Are Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use of
specific property which is permitted as a conditional use in a zoning district
under the provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be classified a
nonconforming use in such zoning district, but shall, without further action,
be considered a conforming use on that particular zoning lot.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)
1268.09 MAINTENANCE, CONSTRUCTION OR REPAIR OF REQUIRED FACILITIES.
   (a)    No person owning or being in possession of land within the City
shall:
      (1)    Permit trash, debris, litter or putrid substances to accumulate,
be of a fugitive nature or otherwise cause annoyance to other properties during
construction of any development or after completion;
      (2)    Allow to continue a structure, use or activity which is contrary
to the provisions of this Zoning Code,
Chapter 1280,
Chapter 1222,
Chapter 1224, the Building Code or any other provision of these Codified
Ordinances relating to development, control and maintenance;
      (3)    Permit to continue the existence of an incomplete or damaged
building, structure, fence, parking lot, landscape, sign, utility system, storm
drainage facility or other required work pursuant to the Codes and chapters
specified in paragraph (a)(2) hereof, or allow the same to remain in a state of
disassembly, deterioration or disrepair.
   (b)   Upon information that land, or a building, structure, utility or other
required improvement is being allowed to exist in violation of subsection (a)
hereof, the Director of Service or his or her designee shall cause written
notice of the nature of such violation to be served on the owner or other
person having possession of such land. Thereupon, such item shall be brought
into compliance with this section by the owner or other person in possession
thereof and the violation specified in such notice shall be eliminated within
the time specified by the Director in such notice. In determining the time
allowed for correction of such violation, the Director shall allow a reasonable
period necessary to permit correction and elimination of the violation, taking
weather conditions into account and considering the actual time required for
completion of the work.
   (c)   If the owner or other person in possession of such land fails to
comply within the time allowed in the notice provided in subsection (b) hereof,
Council, subject to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction, shall cause
the work required to eliminate the violations noted to be done at the expense
of the City and the amount of money so expended shall be recovered from the
owner as provided herein.
   (d)   The Director of Finance shall make a written return to the Montgomery
County Auditor of the action of the City under subsections (b) and (c) hereof,
with a statement of the costs incurred by the City, including amounts for
materials, labor and equipment, and a proper description of the premises. Such
amounts shall be entered upon the tax duplicate and be a lien upon such land
from and after the date of entry, to be collected with other taxes and returned
to the City with other items of the General Fund.
(Ord. 79-56. Passed 11-13-79.)

certified mail to, the last known mailing address, residence or place of
business of the responsible party.
   Any person failing to comply with a legal notice and requirement, as
provided for in this subsection, is subject to the assessments set forth in

      (4)   The citation tag shall be sufficient notice, summons and legal
service thereof for the purpose specified therein, provided, however, that the

work order to the owner of the premises involved, the agent of such owner or
the person doing such work, and shall post at the site of the work a
distinctive placard informing the public and all concerned that work at the
site has been stopped by official order. Such order may be oral or written and
shall, in any case, state the conditions under which the work may be resumed.
Such order shall also direct the performance of such work as may be necessary
to remove any violation of this Zoning Code.
      (1)   Upon receiving such order, the recipient thereof shall immediately
cease such work and cause such work to be ceased by all other persons engaged
therein. If the recipient disagrees therewith, he or she may request
confirmation thereof in writing from the Code Enforcement Officer and may then
appeal from such order as provided in Section

work until such appeal has been heard and favorably acted upon.
      (2)   Whoever violates any such order or continues any such prohibited
work after notice, oral or written, that such order has been issued, is subject
to the assessments set forth in subsection (e) hereof and the penalty set forth

1282.02 RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE; VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   The owner or tenant in possession of each and every tract of real
estate in the City is responsible for the observance of all provisions of this
chapter and any other ordinance or regulation of the City relative to signs
situated on premises owned by him or her or of which he or she has possession.
   (b)   No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct, enlarge,
change, maintain or use any sign or device in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter or any regulation promulgated pursuant to this
chapter.
   (c)   If any sign is or is proposed to be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged, changed, maintained or used in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter or any regulation promulgated pursuant to this
chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer or other designated officer of the City,
or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be damaged by such
violation, in addition to other remedies provided by law, may institute a
proceeding in any proper court to enjoin, abate or remove such unlawful use of
a sign as stated in this section.
   (d)   Signs are to be installed, placed, and maintained in the City only in
compliance with this chapter. If provisions of this chapter are in conflict
with any other City ordinance, the more restrictive requirement(s) shall apply.
The responsibility for compliance with this chapter rests jointly and severally
upon the sign owner, the permit holder, and any parties holding the present
right of possession and control of the property where a sign is located,
mounted, or installed, and the legal owner of the lot or parcel, even if the
sign was mounted, installed, erected or displayed without the consent or
knowledge of the owner and/or other parties holding the legal right to
immediate possession and control.
   (e)   The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to require removal of any
sign installed in violation of this chapter. Furthermore, the Code Enforcement
Officer is authorized to remove or require the immediate removal or repair
without written notice of any unsafe sign that creates an immediate hazard to
persons or property or that is in the public right-of-way.
   (f)   The costs of removal or repair of a sign by the City shall be borne by
the person who installed the sign, and, if unknown, the owner or lessee of the
sign and of the property on which the sign is located. If the City incurs costs
in the removal or repair of a sign, the City may bring an action in municipal
or common pleas court to recover its costs or, in the alternative, such amount
shall be certified by the Director of Finance to the County Auditor, and placed
by the Auditor upon the tax duplicate to be a lien against the real estate from
and after the date of entry upon the duplicate, to be collected as other taxes
and returned to the City, with the effect that the total cost of such work
constitutes a lien on the property which has priority ahead of any mortgages on
the premises. Such collection proceedings or certification to the County
Auditor shall only be initiated by the City after property owners and/or others
with an interest in the property have been offered at least a fourteen calendar
day period to remit full payment for charges incurred.
(Ord. 82-7. Passed 2-9-82; Ord. 18-01. Passed 2-27-18.)
1282.025 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The overall purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare through reasonable, consistent, and non-
discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this chapter are not
intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended
to regulate the adverse secondary effects of signs. The sign regulations are
especially intended to address the secondary effects that may adversely impact
aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety. This chapter is designed to serve
substantial governmental interests and, in some cases, compelling governmental
interests such as traffic safety and warning signs of threats to bodily injury
or death. This chapter is not intended to extend its regulatory regime to
objects that are not traditionally considered signs for purpose of government
regulation.
   (b)   To preserve and promote the City as a desirable community in which to
live, visit, work, play, and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive and
safe environment is of primary importance. The regulations of signs within the
City is an important tool by which to achieve this desired end. Further, it
continues to be the purpose of this chapter to promote optimal conditions for
serving sign owners' needs and respecting their rights to identification while
balancing the safety interests of the community. The regulation of signs within
the City is necessary and in the public interest, and these regulations have
been prepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the City
and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended more specifically to
address the interests of aesthetics, traffic and pedestrian safety, economic
development, effective communication, identification of goods and services,
compatibility with surroundings, reduction of visual clutter, zoning district
considerations, scale and design considerations, maintenance and safety,
property values, and enforcement concerns.
(Ord. 18-01. Passed 2-27-18.)
1282.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All signs erected in the City are subject to the following
requirements:
      (1)   Viewpoint neutrality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this chapter: (i) no sign or sign structure shall be subject to any limitation
based upon the viewpoint of the message contained on such sign or displayed on
such sign structure; (ii) it is the policy of the City to regulate signs in a
manner that does not favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech and does
not regulate protected noncommercial speech by message content; and (iii)
within this chapter, any distinction between onsite signs and offsite signs
applies only to commercial messages; it does not apply to noncommercial
messages.
      (2)   Substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, any sign erected
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may, at the option of the owner,
contain a noncommercial message in lieu of a commercial message and the
noncommercial copy may be substituted in whole or in part at any time in place
of the commercial copy. The noncommercial message (copy) may occupy the entire
sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from a
commercial message to a noncommercial message or from one noncommercial message
to another noncommercial message; provided, however, that there is no change in
the size, height, setback, or spacing criteria contained in this chapter.
      (3)   Administrative interpretation and discretionary approval.
Interpretations of this chapter may be made by the Code Enforcement Officer or
such other officer as designated by the City Manager pursuant to Section
1282.07. All interpretations of this chapter are to be exercised considering
the policies, purposes, and intent set forth herein. Whenever a sign permit or
other approval is subject to discretion, such discretion shall not be exercised
as to message content, but instead shall be directed to structural and location
factors, including, as applicable: (i) whether the location and placement of
the sign will endanger motorists; (ii) whether the sign will cover, blanket, or
interfere with any prominent view of a structure of facade of historical or
architectural significance; (iii) whether the sign will obstruct views of users
or adjacent buildings to side yards, front yards, or open space; (iv) whether
the sign will negatively impact the visual quality of a public open space; (v)
whether the sign is compatible with building heights of the existing
neighborhood; (vi) whether the sign's lighting or illumination system will
cause hazardous or unsafe driving conditions for motorists.
      (4)   Consent of legal owner of property. Except as required by State or
Federal law, no sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner of
the property on which the signs mounted or displayed. For purposes of this
policy, "owner'' means the holder of the legal title to the property and any
party and person holding a present legal right to possession, control, or use
of the property.
      (5)   Signs on public property. Except as required by State or Federal
law, or otherwise permitted by this chapter, any sign installed or placed on
public property shall be deemed illegal and shall be forfeited to the public
and subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies provided hereunder,
the City shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing the
sign the cost of removal and disposal of such sign.
      (6)   Yard requirements. All signs shall be placed in observance of the
yard requirements of the Zoning Code, unless such requirements are specifically
modified by this chapter.
      (7)   Painted signs. Signs shall not be painted directly upon the surface
of any building or structure, with the exception of signs painted on the glass
surface of windows. This prohibition shall not apply to graphic displays, which
shall not exceed thirty percent of the wall area on which they are displayed,
provided no words, letters or numbers are included as part of the graphic
display, and provided permission of the Board of Zoning Appeals is secured and
an application fee is paid before a graphic is utilized.
(Ord. 89-26. Passed 9-12-89.)
      (8)   Construction. Except as modified in this chapter for rules relative
to location and size, the provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code, as
adopted in
Chapter 1422, shall apply to signs.
(Ord. 98-11. Passed 7-14-98.)
      (9)   Maintenance and removal. All signs and sign structures shall be
kept in repair so that they are structurally safe. Signs which are no longer
functional or safe shall be removed by the owner or tenant immediately. After
thirty days from notice by the Code Enforcement Officer to remove such a sign
and upon failure to comply with such notice within the time specified, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall cause the removal of such sign. The owner or agent of
such sign shall bear the full costs of such removal and shall be billed
accordingly. Upon vacating a nonresidential establishment, the owner shall be
responsible for the removal of all signs used in conjunction with such
establishment.
      (10)   Minimum temporary signage allowed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the chapter, each parcel of real property shall be allowed up to a
maximum of twelve square feet of temporary noncommercial signage, for a period
not to exceed forty-five days per calendar year.
   (b)   All references in this chapter to the Zoning Code shall be to Title
Eight of Part Twelve of the Planning and Zoning Code, and all references to
zoning districts, rules or provisions of the Zoning Code shall be to such
Title. This chapter shall be read in conjunction with such Zoning Code.

1422.01 1998 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the

terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units that tend to reduce the cost of construction and erection
without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and security of
the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and without
preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods
of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including

a permit or to permit the use of a particular material and/or equipment or
method of construction in a proposed structure, provided that such appeal is
filed within thirty days of the date of receipt of a written decision from the
Building Official. The appeal application must include proposed alternatives,
modifications or substitutions, complete plans of the structure or other
pertinent information and payment of fees. The appeal shall be based on one or
both of the following grounds stated in the application, to wit:
            1.   That the decision of the Building Official is erroneous or
constitutes an erroneous application of the particular provisions of this Code
or the Unified Fire Code or related laws and ordinances involved, or is
otherwise contrary to law;
            2.   That a modified application or alternative arrangement is
available and feasible whereby the strict application of a particular provision
may be modified with alternatives without defeating the public safety, health
and general welfare or the purpose and intent of this Code and the Unified Fire
Code.
   A hearing shall be held within a reasonable time, but not to exceed thirty
days following receipt of the appeal application by the Secretary of the Board.

applicable laws and shall be used to defray the normal expenses of the Board,
including payment for the time of the Secretary, payment for the preparation of
transcripts of hearings by a court reporter when deemed necessary or payment
for other similar expenses as the Board may authorize. The Secretary or the
Board may provide for the presence of a court reporter at any hearing, at the
Secretary's discretion or at the discretion of the Board. The appellant may
require the presence of a court reporter at a hearing by giving notice to the
Secretary to that effect at the time of filing the application for an appeal.
   107.8.2 Delegation of tests. The Building Official shall, when he or she
deems it desirable, request the Chairperson of the Board to designate members
of the Board to make an investigation into the facts and ramifications of an
appeal and to make a report of the findings to the Board. In this event, the
decision of the Board may be postponed to a later date, within the discretion
of the Board, not to exceed 60 days after the hearing at which such
investigation was requested.

quorum. A majority of the quorum shall be necessary to make a decision on an
appeal, modification, deviation or approved rule.
   107.10    Re-hearing. The Board shall, upon application of either the
appellant or the Building Official, grant a re-hearing before the Board in any
case where new evidence is presented which, in the opinion of the Chairperson,
may justify a re-hearing. Such re-hearing shall not serve to stop the execution
of the previous decision of the Board pending the re-hearing, except by special
action of the Board so directing.
   SECTION 108 - ALTERNATE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS (Added)
   108.1    General. The provisions of this Code are not intended to limit the
appropriate use of materials, appliances, equipment or methods of design or
construction not specifically prescribed by this Code, provided the Building
Official determines that the proposed alternate materials, appliances,
equipment or methods of design or construction are at least equivalent of that
prescribed in this Code in suitability, quality, strength, effectiveness, fire
resistance, durability, dimensional stability, safety and sanitation.
   The Building Official may require that evidence or proof be submitted to
substantiate any claim that may be made regarding the proposed alternate.
   108.2    Tests. Determination of equivalence shall be based on design or
test methods or other such standards approved by the Building Official. The
Building Official may accept, as supporting data to assist in this
determination, duly authenticated reports on acceptance documents from the
Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc., the Southern
Building Code Congress International, Inc., the International Conference of
Building Officials, the National Evaluation Service Committee of the Council of
American Building Officials, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development or from other approved authoritative sources for all materials or
assemblies proposed for use which are not specifically provided for by this

provisions shall be paid by the applicant.
   SECTION 110 - LIABILITY (Amended)
   The Building Official or the Building Official's authorized representative,
acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of his or her duties,
shall not render himself or herself personally liable for any damage that may
accrue to persons or property as a result of any act or by reason of any act or
omission in the discharge of his or her duties. Any suit brought against the
Building Official or his or her authorized representative because of such an
act or omission performed in the enforcement of this Code shall be defended by
the jurisdiction until final determination, and any judgment thereof shall be
assumed by the jurisdiction.
   This Code shall not relieve or lessen the responsibility of an owner,
operator or controller of a building for any damages to persons or property
caused by defects, nor shall the building department or its jurisdiction be
held to assume any such liability by reason of inspections or permits
authorized by this Code.
   SECTION 111 - PERMIT (Amended)
   111.1     Permit required. A permit shall be obtained before beginning
construction, alteration, or repairs, other than ordinary repairs, using
application forms furnished by the Building Official.
   As used in this section, ordinary repairs are nonstructural repairs and do
not include addition to, alteration of or replacement or relocation of water
supply, sewer, drainage, drain leader, gas, soil, waste, vent or similar
piping, electrical wiring or mechanical or other work for which a permit is
required by the Building Official.
   111.2    Permit fees. Permit fees shall be established by the local
jurisdiction.
   111.3    Time limitation of permit. A permit for any proposed work shall be
deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of issuance unless
construction has been diligently pursued. Additionally, any permit shall be
deemed to be abandoned if authorized work has not been diligently pursued for
any six-month period. For the purpose of this section, it shall be prima facie
evidence that construction has not been diligently pursued if there has been no
approved inspection made on the project during a six-month period.
   When the Building Official determines that a permit has been abandoned, he
or she may serve notice upon the holder of the permit, the owner or his or her
agent or the person having charge of the work. Within thirty days of
notification, the permit holder, the owner or his or her agent or the person
having charge of the work shall apply for a permit extension, arrange for a
final inspection of the project, file an appeal to the Residential Board of
Appeals or remove all construction done to that point, restoring the site to
the condition before construction work was done. If requested, the Building
Official may grant, for just cause, one extension, but not more than two
extensions, for an additional period not to exceed ninety days each.
   If the permit holder, the owner or his or her agent or the person having
charge of the work does not remedy the abandoned permit within the stipulated
thirty days, the Building Official may declare any partially completed work a
public nuisance and may begin proceedings to eliminate a public nuisance as
provided by local or State law.
   111.4    Previous approvals. Nothing in the Code shall require changes in
the plans, construction or designated use of a building for which a lawful
permit has been issued or otherwise lawfully authorized before the effective
date of the Code, provided that work under such permit or authorization is
under active prosecution upon such date, or is actively prosecuted within
ninety days after such date, and that all work thereunder is completed, as so
authorized, within two years after the date thereof or duly authorized
extension of time. However, if the work has been diligently prosecuted, an
extension of time shall be granted for the completion of such work which shall
permit its completion in accordance with the original permit.
   111.5    Approved papers. All approved plans, specifications and other
papers filed with the application for the permit shall be so stamped or
endorsed by the Building Official, and one set shall be kept at the building or
work site until the project has been completed. True copies of all or as many
of the drawings, specifications and statements as determined by the Building
Official shall become public records and shall be maintained by the Building
Official or his or her representative.
   111.6    Revocation of permits. The Building Official may revoke any permit
or approval issued under this Code or may stop the work on an entire project or
a portion of a project for any of the following reasons:
      1.   Whenever there is a violation of any of the provisions of this Code
and/or a State statute or local ordinance relating to the same subject matter;
      2.   Whenever the continuance of any work for which such a permit was
issued or required becomes dangerous to life or property;
      3.   Whenever there is a violation of any condition on which the issuance
of the permit or approval was based; or
      4.   Wherever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made upon
the application, plans or specifications on which the issuance of the permit or
approval was based.
   The revocation notice of the permit in every instance shall be in writing
and shall be served upon the holder of the permit, the owner, his or her agent
or the person having charge of the work. Service may be made in person or by
ordinary mail sent prepaid to the last known address of the permit holder. It
is the responsibility of the permit holder to inform the Building Official of
any change of address. Any revocation notice shall also be posted upon the
building or structure in question by the Building Official. After the notice is
received or posted, no person shall proceed with any operation for which such a
permit was issued. No part of the fees for such revoked permit shall be
returned. Revocation of a permit shall be subject to appeal to the Board (see
Section 107).
   111.7    Approval in part. The Building Official may issue a permit for the
construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before
the plans and specifications for the whole building have been submitted or
approved. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other part of the
building or structure shall proceed at his or her own risk with the building
construction and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will
be granted.
   111.8    Permit validity. The issuances of a permit shall not authorize the
violation of any of the provisions of this Code.
   SECTION 112 - PLANS (Amended)
   112.1    Plans required. When required by the Building Official, plans shall
be drawn to scale and shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the nature and
extent of the work proposed and shall show in detail that it will conform to

Director of Finance to the County Auditor, and placed by the Auditor upon the
tax duplicate to be a lien against the real estate from and after the date of
entry upon the duplicate, to be collected as other taxes and returned to the
City, with the effect that the total cost of such work constitutes a lien on
the property which has priority ahead of any mortgages on the premises. Such

initiated by the City after property owners and/or others with an interest in
the property have been offered at least a fourteen calendar day period to remit
full payment for charges incurred.

   (a)   The Housing Officer shall bear responsibility for the interpretation
of this chapter and for the issuance of notices of violation pursuant thereto.
   (b)   Determinations of the Housing Officer may be appealed only to the City
Property Maintenance Hearing Board. Decisions of the City Property Maintenance
Board may be appealed only to the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 84-6. Passed 3-13-84; Ord. 01-13. Passed 6-12-01; Ord. 04-29. Passed 12-
14-04; Ord. 13-11. Passed 6-26-13.)
1454.18 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE HEARING BOARD AND APPEALS PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Creation. A Property Maintenance Hearing Board (Board) is hereby
established.
   (b)   Members; Designation. The Board shall consist of three Council Members
selected by the City Council.
   (c)   Powers, Duties, Functions, Scope of Review, Rebuttable Presumption of
No Economic Waste. The City Council hereby delegates to the Board the City
Council’s adjudicatory power to review administrative appeals filed pursuant to
Section
1454.09 (d) and
1454.17 (b), both of which refer to determinations made by the Housing Officer
and set out in a notice of violation. The City Council further delegates to the
Board the adjudicatory power to review demolition notices of violation as set
forth in Section
1454.09 (b). In reviewing demolition notices of violation, the Board's
consideration of economic waste shall be based solely on the condition of the
exterior of the premises, fact witness testimony, and/or public records
submitted into evidence. It shall not be necessary for the Board to secure an
interior inspection and/or expert witness testimony to decide the issue of
economic waste. There shall be a presumption of no economic waste if the
exterior of the premises, fact witness testimony, and/or public records
establish to the Board's satisfaction that demolition is an appropriate method
to remediate the public nuisance. This presumption of no economic waste may be
rebutted, however, by an owner and/or interested party with expert witness
testimony or other evidence submitted by the owner and/or interested party to
the Housing Officer and/or Board to the extent the Housing Officer and/or Board
consider such evidence to be probative and persuasive and have an opportunity
to cross examine the expert witness.
   (d)   Rules of Procedure. The Board is authorized to adopt all procedural
rules as may be necessary or beneficial for the conduct of its hearings.
   (e)   Meetings, Attendance. The Board shall meet as necessary. A majority of
Board members must be present to conduct a hearing.
   (f)   Filing Period for Standard Notice of Violation and Procedure. Any
notice of appeal of a standard notice of violation must be made in writing and
delivered to the Housing Officer on or before five calendar days after the date
of the standard notice of violation. An appeal of a standard notice of
violation may only be initiated by the owner to whom the standard notice of
violation is directed, and/or the owner’s attorney. Any request for an appeal
must include a written statement requesting a hearing signed by the owner or by
that party’s attorney, a copy of the notice of violation being appealed, and a
brief statement as to why the owner believes the standard notice of violation
should be reversed or otherwise modified.
   (g)   Parties Who May Participate in the Appeal. Only individuals to whom a
standard notice of violation or a demolition notice of violation have been
addressed, or their attorneys, have the right to participate in an appeal or
review before the Board.
   (h)   Hearing Date. The hearing for an appeal of a standard notice of
violation shall occur not less than ten calendar days nor more than sixty
calendar days after the Housing Officer’s receipt of the notice of appeal. The
hearing for the review of a demolition notice of violation shall occur on the
date specified in the demolition notice of violation.
   (i)   Public Meeting. The hearing shall be conducted at a public meeting.
   (j)   Evidentiary Hearing. The hearing shall be an evidentiary hearing.
   (k)   Decision by the Board. Within thirty calendar days after the
evidentiary hearing, the Board shall issue a written decision containing
findings of fact and a conclusion as to whether the Housing Officer’s decision
as set forth in a notice of violation should be affirmed, reversed, or
otherwise modified in whole or in part. All decisions by the Board shall be in
writing. The decision shall authorize action, by the City Manager or his or her
designee, on behalf of the City, to abate the nuisance. Action by the City
Manager, personally or through a designee, shall be through such legal or
administrative channels as are deemed most appropriate or through use of either
City or private labor to effect the necessary nuisance abatement.
   (l)   Any decision must be supported by at least a two-thirds vote of the
Board. A copy of the decision shall be mailed, with certificate of mailing, to
the last known address of the owner or interested party who participated in the
hearing. It shall be the responsibility of every owner and interested party to
keep the Board apprized of his or her current mailing address. For purposes of
appeal pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506, the final decision will be deemed to
have been entered on the date on which the copy of the Board's decision is
mailed.
   (m)   Thirty Day Waiting Period Prior to Demolition. If the Board affirms
the findings in a demolition notice of violation, no demolition by the City
shall take place sooner than thirty calendar days after the date of the Board’s
decision.

1456.001 LAND USE AND CONTROL MEASURES; AUTHORITY OF CITY MANAGER.
   (a)   The City of Englewood assures the Federal Emergency Management Agency
that it will enact as necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having
flood hazards, adequate land use and control measures with effective
enforcement provisions consistent with the Criteria set forth in Section 60.3
of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.
   (b)   The City vests the City Manager with the responsibility, authority and
means to:
      (1)   Assist the Administrator, at his or her request, in his or her
delineation of the limits of the areas having special flood hazards.
      (2)   Provide such information as the Administrator may request
concerning present uses and occupancy of the flood plain areas.
      (3)   Cooperate with Federal, State and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map and identify flood plain areas, and
cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to management of adjoining
flood plain areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards.
      (4)   Submit, on the anniversary date of the community's initial
eligibility, an annual report to the Administrator on the progress made during
the past year, within the community, in the development and implementation of
flood plain management measures.
      (5)   Upon occurrence, notify the Administrator in writing, whenever the
boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or whenever the
community has otherwise assumed, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce, flood plain management regulations for a particular area, and, in
order that all Flood Hazard Boundary Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps
accurately represent the community's boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for which the
community has assumed or relinquished flood plain management regulatory
authority.
   (c)   The City appoints the City Manager to maintain for public inspection
and to furnish upon request, for the determination of the applicable flood
insurance risk premium rate within all areas having special flood hazards,
identified on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, any
certificates of floodproofing and any information on the elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) of the level of the lowest floor (including the basement) of
all new or substantially improved structures, and a statement as to whether or
not such structures contain a basement and as to whether or not such structures
have been floodproofed to the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the structures were floodproofed.
   (d)   The City agrees to take such other official action as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the objectives of the program.
(Res. 36-92. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
    (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.02 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
    (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (g)   Ensure that persons who occupy an area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)

reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this chapter.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.11 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   A development permit shall be obtained from the City Manager before
construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard
established in Section

furnished by the City Manager and may include, but not be limited to, site
specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the locations
thereof. Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including the basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood
hazard areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1456.16(a) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section

altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification
by a registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
   (b)   An application for a development permit is not required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting and basement sealing, or for small
nonstructural development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any proposed action exempt from filing
for a development permit is also exempt from the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.12 ENFORCEMENT.
   The City Manager is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying a development permit application in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.13 DUTIES OF CITY MANAGER.
   The duties of the City Manager under this chapter include, but are not
limited to, the following:
   (a)   Permit Review. The City Manager shall:
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      (2)   Review all development permits to ensure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant is responsible for
obtaining such permits as required, including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, the City Manager shall ensure that the encroachment provisions of
Section
1456.17(a) are met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Data. Areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map or
Flood Hazard Boundary Map. Within these areas, the City Manager shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a Federal, State or other source, including data obtained under
Section
1456.16(f), in order to administer Sections
1456.16(a) and (b) and
1456.17.
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and state whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1456.11(a)(3); and
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to this
chapter.
   (d)   Alteration of Watercourses. The City Manager shall:
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency;
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1456.11 (a) (4) to certify that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of such watercourse will not be diminished; and
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of such watercourse, so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. The City Manager shall make
interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map
boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood
elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1456.14.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.14 APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   The Administrative Board for Planning and Zoning Appeals shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Administrative Board for Planning and Zoning Appeals shall hear
and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision or determination made by the City Manager in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Persons aggrieved by a decision of the Administrative Board for
Planning and Zoning Appeals, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the
County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, the Administrative Board for Planning
and Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(4)
hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (6)   The City Manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in base flood levels would result.
      (4)   A variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   A variance shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in
paragraph (a)(4) hereof; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.15 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (c)   Utilities.Public utilities, including wellhouses and associated
facilities, shall be permitted. However, the following standards shall apply to
all water supply, sanitary sewerage and waste disposal systems not otherwise
regulated by the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems.
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (3)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (d)   Subdivision Proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall meet the specific standards of Section
1456.16(f).
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.16 FLOODPROOFING STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in Sections
1456.06 and
1456.13(b), the following provisions are required:
   (a)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including the
basement, elevated to the base flood elevation.
   (b)   Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the
level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the base
flood elevation;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1456.11(a)(3).
   (c)   Accessory Structures. An exemption to the elevation or dry
floodproofing standards may be granted for accessory structures (e.g. sheds,
detached garages) containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such
structures shall meet the encroachment provisions of Section
1456.17(a) and the following additional standards:
      (1)   Such structures shall not be used for human habitation.
      (2)   Such structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential.
      (3)   Such structures shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters.
      (4)   Such structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed.
   (d)   Manufactured Homes. The following standards shall apply to all new and
substantially improved manufactured homes not subject to the manufactured home
requirements of Ohio R.C. 3733.01:
      (1)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section
1456.15(a)(2).
      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such
that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at the base flood elevation.
         These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are either:
      (1)   Located on sites for 180 days or more; or
      (2)   Not fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   (e)   Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor. The following provisions apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns or posts.
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must:
      (1)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
      (2)   Meet or exceed the following criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot
above grade.
         C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
openings, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
   (f)   Subdivisions and Large Developments.In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1456.06 or
1456.13(b), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less):
      (1)   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices;
      (2)   If paragraph (f)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1456.15 and this section.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.17 FLOODWAYS.
   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. A
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential. The Flood
Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map) does not designate a
floodway. However, floodways may be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1456.13(b). The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
   (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If subsection (a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Section
1456.16.
   (c)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon prior approval by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the City
Manager to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 92-24. Passed 7-14-92.)
1456.99 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter, including violations of and noncompliance with conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions, is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both, for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (b)   Nothing in subsection (a) hereof shall be deemed to prevent the City
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation or noncompliance.
