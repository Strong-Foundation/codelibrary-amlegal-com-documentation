EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

CHARTER
OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF TROTWOOD, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the Municipality of Trotwood, Ohio, in order to secure the
benefits of local self-government under the Constitution of Ohio, do adopt this
Charter for the government of the Municipality of Trotwood. All Council
positions are non-partisan. (Amended 11/08/2016)
ARTICLE I
Name, Boundaries and Forms of Government
   SECTION 1-1. NAME AND BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Trotwood began in the early 1850s as a railroad stop, originally
called Higgins Station. By 1866, our town had grown large enough for its own
post office and Mr. Lewis Pfoutz applied for one to be named Higgins Station.
However, he was told that the name was too similar to another nearby post
office, Higgins Mill. The story goes that Mr. Pfoutz had read Charles Dickens'
David Copperfield and he admired the character of Aunt Betsey Trotwood so he
proposed the name "Trotwood" for the post office. The name was accepted and the
village grew, incorporating as Trotwood in 1901, reaching city status in 1971,
then merging with the surrounding Madison Township on January 1, 1996. To our
knowledge, Trotwood is the only incorporated entity so named in the United
States, making us one of a kind.
   (B)   The present Municipality, known as the City of Trotwood, Ohio, shall
continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name of the City of
Trotwood, with the same boundaries, but with powers and authority to change its
boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the manner
authorized by the general laws of Ohio. No territory shall be detached from the
Municipality without the consent of Council. The Municipality shall not be
annexed to any other municipality without the consent of the voters.
(Amended 11/08/2016)
   SECTION 1-2. FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   The form of Government shall be Council - Manager. (Amended 08/04/1992)
ARTICLE II
Powers
   SECTION 2-1. POWERS.
   The City shall have all the powers that may now or hereafter be possessed or
exercised by municipal corporations under the Constitution and Laws of Ohio.
Title to all real property shall be taken in the name of the City.
   All powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter, or
if not so prescribed, in the manner provided by ordinance or resolution of
Council. When not prescribed in this Charter or by ordinance or resolution, the
powers shall be exercised in the manner provided by the Laws of Ohio.
   The powers of the City under this Charter shall be construed liberally in
favor of the City and the specific mention of particular powers in the Charter
shall not be construed as limiting, in any way, the general powers stated in
this Article. No act of the City shall be invalid or limited by reason of
failure to enumerate a particular power in this Charter. The City shall have,
and may exercise, any and all powers, either expressed or implied, which would
be competent for this Charter to enumerate, as fully and completely as though
such powers were specifically included herein.
(Amended 11/06/2001)
 
 
ARTICLE III
Council
 
   SECTION 3-1. POWERS.
      The legislative power of the Municipality shall be vested in a Mayor and
Council, all of whom are electors of the Municipality. (Amended 11/02/1993)
 
   SECTION 3-2. MEMBERS AND TERMS.
   At the general municipal election in November 1997, and thereafter, one (1)
member of Council shall be elected from each of the four (4) districts into
which the Municipality shall be divided at the general municipal election in
November 1995; two (2) members of Council shall be elected from the
Municipality at-large. Individual terms of office for all members of Council
shall be four (4) years in length.
   The members of Council shall begin their terms on the first business day of
January following their election.
(Amended 11/06/2001)
 
   SECTION 3-3. QUALIFICATIONS.
   Council Members shall be qualified electors of the Municipality, residents
of the Municipality for one (1) year, and, if elected by district, a resident
at the time of filing the nominating petition of the district to be
represented. Council Members shall not hold any other elected public office or
hold any employment with the City during the term for which said Council
Members were elected or appointed. Any member who ceases to possess any of the
qualifications herein required shall immediately forfeit the office and the
vacancy shall be filled as provided for herein. (Amended 11/07/2017)
 
 
   SECTION 3-4. REMOVAL AND VACANCIES.
   (A)   Vacancies. The office of a Council Member or Council Member-Elect
shall become vacant upon death, resignation, forfeiture, or removal from office
in any manner authorized by this Charter.
   (B)   Forfeiture of Office. Council shall be the judge of the election and
qualification of its members. Council may punish or expel any member for gross
misconduct, or for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, or upon
conviction of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude while in
office, or for disorderly conduct, or violation of its rules during the term of
office. No expulsion shall take place without the concurrence of six (6)
members, nor until the member shall have been notified of the charge and been
given a hearing in front of Council, unless the member waives the right to the
hearing. Any vacancy created upon the expulsion of a member shall be filled as
provided for in this Charter. In addition to these provisions, absence from
three (3) consecutive regular meetings of Council shall operate to vacate the
seat of a Council Member unless the absence is excused.
   (C)   Filling of Vacancies. Vacancies in the office of a Council Member
shall be filled within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of the vacancy
by the vote of the majority of the remaining members of Council. If Council
fails to fill any vacancy within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of
the vacancy, the power of the Council to fill the vacancy shall lapse; and the
Clerk of Council, by the authority of the Charter, shall request the Board of
Elections of Montgomery County to hold an election to fill the vacancy. Such
election shall be held at the next general election or special election already
scheduled, and such general or special election shall occur at least seventy-
five (75) days after the date of the request to the Board of Elections by the
Clerk of Council. The individual elected in such election shall take office
immediately following the election certification by the Board of Elections and
shall serve the balance of the unexpired term.
   An appointee under this section shall qualify under the provisions of this
Charter, and if more than two (2) years remain of the unexpired term at the
time of appointment, the appointee shall serve until a successor for the term
is certified at the next November municipal election whether in an odd or even
year, which occurs at least one hundred (100) days after being appointed so as
to allow nominating petitions to be filed by the ninety (90) day deadline
before such an election. That election shall be held to determine what person
is elected to serve for the balance of the unexpired term. If at the time of
appointment less than two (2) years remain of the unexpired term, the appointee
shall serve the remaining term without election.
(Amended 11/08/2016; 11/02/2021)
 
   SECTION 3-5. COMPENSATION.
   (A)   Council Members first elected under this Charter shall receive a
salary of $250.00 annually. The first Mayor to serve under this Charter shall
receive a salary of $1,000.00.
   (B)   A Compensation Board shall, every five (5) years, study and recommend
any changes to the compensation of the Mayor and Council Members. The first
review shall occur in 2025. The Compensation Board shall consist of seven (7)
members who are registered electors of the City appointed by Council and
confirmed by Council by resolution. Each member of Council will have the right
to name one (1) member. The Compensation Board will cease to function ninety
(90) days following the delivery of the Board's report to the Mayor and
Council. The seat of a member of the Board shall be forfeited if such member
fails to maintain the qualifications of an elector of the City, and a
replacement shall be named by the Council Member who made the original
appointment. No Council Member or employee of the City or members of the
immediate family of a Council Member or employee shall be eligible to be a
member of the Compensation Board.
   (C)   The Compensation Board shall elect a Chairperson from its membership.
Within forty-five (45) days of its creation, the Compensation Board shall meet
to consider the compensation of the Mayor and Council Members. The Compensation
Board shall be provided by the Finance Director, a summary of the past five (5)
years wage increases for the non-union employees of the City together with the
budget projections for future non-union wage increases. The Compensation Board
will also be provided the current budget.
   (D)   No later than June 1 of each year that the Compensation Board meets,
the Compensation Board shall prepare a report to Council setting forth its
recommendations for the Mayor and Council Members. Council shall, within thirty
(30) days of receiving the report, either approve it by ordinance or, in the
event a majority of the Council is not in favor thereof, reject it. The
recommendations may not be amended or modified. In the event a recommendation
submitted by the Compensation Board is rejected, Council may request the
Compensation Board to reconvene and submit a revised report to Council. In the
case of rejections, the existing salary shall prevail. In the case of
approvals, the salaries shall go into effect on January 1 of the next year for
any Council Member starting a new term of office. In-term pay increases are not
allowed.
   (E)   The Mayor and Council Members, in addition, shall receive their actual
and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.
(Amended 11/07/2017; 11/02/2021)
 
   SECTION 3-6. THE MAYOR.
   Beginning with the general election in November 1995 and thereafter, the
Mayor shall be elected by a vote of the general public for a term of four (4)
years, to commence on the first business day of January following his or her
election. The elected Mayor thereafter shall retain his or her vote as a member
of Council, but shall have no veto.
   In addition to his or her powers, rights and duties as a member of Council,
the Mayor shall preside at all meetings and shall be recognized as the official
head of the Municipality for all ceremonial purposes, by the Governor for
military purposes and by the courts for the purpose of serving civil process.
The Mayor shall perform all other duties prescribed in this Charter, or by law.
   The Mayor also shall have jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases as
provided by the laws of Ohio, including all statutes now or hereafter enacted,
until such jurisdiction is placed elsewhere by resolution of Council or by
law.*
(Amended 11/02/2004)
   *Editor's Note: The Mayor's Court is currently not in use.
 
   SECTION 3-7. VICE-MAYOR.
   At the regular meeting in January 1996 following its election and every two
(2) years thereafter, Council shall choose one of its members as Vice-Mayor to
exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the Mayor in the case of
the Mayor's temporary absence or disability. Should the office of Mayor become
vacant, the Vice-Mayor shall serve as acting Mayor until the next regular
municipal election. For the purpose of Section
3-4 of the Charter, the Vice-Mayor's position shall be deemed vacant for the
sole purpose of allowing a temporary appointment per the terms of Section
3-4. Upon election of a Mayor, the temporarily appointed Council Member shall
be without office unless elected to or appointed to an open office.
   At such election, a Mayor shall be elected to serve for the unexpired term,
if any; if not, for a full term. Upon the election of a Mayor, other than the
Vice-Mayor then serving as Mayor, the Vice-Mayor may retain a position as
Council Member for the remainder of his or her unexpired term.
(Amended 11/06/2012; 11/08/2016)
 
   SECTION 3-8. MEETINGS.
   Council shall meet regularly at such times as may be prescribed by its
rules, but not less frequently than once each month. Pursuant to Revised Code
121.22, all meetings shall be open to the public except as otherwise provided
by law.
   A regular organizational meeting shall be held during the first week in
January in each year. A majority of the members elected to Council shall
constitute a quorum to do business, but a lesser number may adjourn from time
to time.
   Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or any three (3) members of
Council on 24-hour notice served on each member electronically, or personally
at their residence. The purpose of a special meeting shall be stated in the
notice and no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.
   The Council shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at least 24-
hour advance notice to the news media that have requested notification, except
in the event of an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting shall
notify the news media that have requested notification immediately of the time,
place, and purpose of the meeting.
   All meetings of Council Members called for the purpose of official business
and action shall be conducted in open and public meetings, unless the subject
matter is specifically accepted hereinafter.
   Exceptions to public meetings: All meetings are public except as otherwise
allowed by law.
(Amended 08/04/1992; 11/06/2012; 11/08/2016)
 
   SECTION 3-9. ANNUAL AUDIT.
   During those years in which the State of Ohio shall make an audit of the
affairs of the Municipality, such audit, in Council's discretion, may be
accepted as valid. In such years and in other years, Council may provide for an
audit by a certified public accountant.
 
   SECTION 3-10. CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   Council shall appoint a Clerk of Council, also to be known as the Municipal
Clerk, for an indefinite term, whose duty it shall be to keep the journal and
other records of the Council and to perform such other duties as the Council
may require.
   Council, in its discretion, may assign the duties of the Municipal Clerk to
some other regular employee of the Municipality.
   The Council may remove the Clerk of Council by the affirmative vote of five
(5) of its members.
(Amended 11/06/2012; 11/02/2021)
 
 
ARTICLE IV
Legislation
 
   SECTION 4-1. ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Council actions shall be by ordinance or resolution. Ordinances shall
prescribe permanent rules of conduct or government. Resolutions shall be orders
of the Council of a special or temporary nature.
 
   SECTION 4-2. MAJORITY REQUIRED.
   The affirmative vote of four (4) members of Council shall be necessary for
the passage of any ordinance unless otherwise provided herein. A resolution may
be enacted on a formal motion by a majority vote of the members of Council
present.
 
   SECTION 4-3. FORM.
   No ordinance shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly
expressed in its title. The enacting clause shall be, "Be it ordained by the
Council of the City of Trotwood, State of Ohio." Any ordinance which repeals an
existing ordinance or ordinances in total need only refer to the title,
adopting date and number of said ordinance or ordinances being repealed and any
ordinance which amends an existing ordinance or ordinances or part of the
Municipal Code, shall set out in full the sections or subsections to be
amended, and shall indicate matter to be omitted by enclosing it in brackets or
by strikethrough type and shall indicate new matter by underscoring or by
italics. (Amended 1971)
 
   SECTION 4-4. ENACTMENT OF ORDINANCES.
   Ordinances shall be adopted in the following manner:
   (A)   Upon adoption of a motion requesting the same at any regular or
special meeting, the Law Director shall draft the requested ordinance for
submission at Council's next meeting.
   (B)   The Clerk of Council shall distribute a copy of the Law Director's
drafted or approved ordinance to each Council Member and to the City Manager,
and shall further have copies of the same on file in the Clerk's Office for
public examination. In addition, the Clerk shall publish a brief summary of the
proposed ordinance in accordance with the publication requirements prescribed
by Section
10-8 of this Charter. The Clerk's publication of the proposed ordinance shall
state that copies of the proposed ordinances are available at the office of the
Clerk of Council for inspection during regular business hours, and shall
further specify the time, date, and place for a public hearing thereon.
   (C)   Not less than one week following such publication of the proposed
ordinance, a public hearing shall be held thereof, which public hearing may be
held separately from, or in conjunction with, any regular or special meeting of
Council. All persons interested in the proposed ordinance shall be given an
opportunity to be heard by Council at the scheduled public hearing.
   (D)   At the public hearing, Council may adopt or reject the proposed
ordinance or the proposed ordinance as amended. If the proposed ordinance is
amended and adopted, a brief summary of the adopted ordinance as amended shall
be published by the Clerk of Council in accordance with the publication
requirements prescribed by Section
10-8 of this Charter.
   (E)   As soon as practical after the adoption of any ordinance, the Clerk of
Council shall have a copy of the ordinance, or a summary thereof, as directed
by Council, published in accordance with the publication requirements
prescribed by Section
10-8 of this Charter, together with a notice of its adoption. The Clerk shall
make and retain a certificate as to the time, place, and method by which the
legislation is published, which certificate shall be prima facie evidence that
the ordinance, or a summary thereof, was published as required herein. Failure
to publish any ordinance, or to make and retain the certificate required by
this section, shall not invalidate the ordinance. In the event the Clerk of
Council discovers that an ordinance was not published, or that the
certification required was not prepared as required herein, the Clerk of
Council may publish said ordinance and/or prepare the certification at that
time.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

111.01 REGULAR AND SPECIAL MEETINGS.
   (a)   Regular Meetings. In accordance with Charter Section
3.8 (Meetings), Council shall meet regularly at such times as may be prescribed
by its rules but not less frequently than once each month. Council hereby
reaffirms its rules for the scheduling of regular meetings at the first and
third Monday of each calendar month at 7:30 p.m. in the Council Chambers of the
Trotwood Government Center. In the event that a Monday shall fall upon a
holiday, Council, by a majority vote, shall determine the best available day
following such a regularly-scheduled Monday meeting and shall utilize that day
as its regularly-scheduled meeting subject to provisions of notice as set forth
in Charter and Ohio R.C. 121.22.
   (b)   Boards and Commissions. The City's boards and commissions shall also
have regularly-scheduled meetings as prescribed by Council from time to time.
   (c)   Special Meetings. Pursuant to Charter Section
 3.8 (Meetings), special meetings may be called by the Mayor or any three
Councilmembers on twelve hours notice served on each member personally or left
at his usual place of residence. The purpose of a special meeting shall be
stated in the notice and no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.
      (1)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 121.22(F), a public body shall not hold a
special meeting unless it gives at least twenty-four hours' advance notice to
the news media that have requested notification, except in the event of an
emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an emergency,
the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the news media that have
requested notification immediately of the time, place and purpose of the
meeting.
      (2)   However, it is the belief of the City that its Charter, under the
Home Rule Power of the Ohio Constitution, supersedes Ohio R.C. Section 121.22
requiring twenty-four hours' notice as opposed to twelve hours' notice as set
forth in Charter Section 3.8. Therefore, the City does hereby establish its
rule to call special meetings by its Mayor or any three members of Council on
twenty-four hours' notice served on each member personally or left at his usual
place of residence. The purpose of a special meeting shall be stated in the
notice and no other business shall be transacted at such meeting, as set forth
in Charter Section
3.8.
   (d)   Notification. The City hereby establishes a rule that any person may,
upon request and payment of a reasonable fee in the amount as set forth by
Council from time to time, obtain reasonable advance notification of all
meetings in which any specific type of public business is to be discussed. In
addition, those who request advance notification of all meetings shall provide
self- addressed stamped envelopes to the Municipal Clerk, for advance
notification pursuant to Ohio R.C. Section 121.22(F).
(1987 Code Sec. 30.03)
111.02 COUNCIL BUSINESS.
   (a)   Agendas. Agendas shall be prepared by the Clerk of Council for each
regular Council meeting. Nothing in this section shall prevent the introduction
of new business not listed on the agenda.
   (b)   Order of Business. The order of the agenda shall be as follows:
      (1)   Call to order;
      (2)   Pledge of Allegiance to the flag;
      (3)   Roll call;
      (4)   Action on minutes of previous meetings;
      (5)   Public hearings;
      (6)   Resolutions;
      (7)   Old and new business:
         A.   Mayor;
         B.   City Manager;
         C.   Council members;
         D.   Staff;
      (8)   Visitors and communications.
   (c)   Public Participation at Meetings. If an item is on the agenda,
interested citizens desiring to speak shall do so following the introduction of
the topic when recognized by the Mayor or presiding person. If the topic is not
on the agenda, it shall be discussed under Visitors and Communications.
Individuals recognized to speak will:
      (1)   State their name and address;
      (2)   Address remarks to the Mayor or presiding person;
      (3)   Respond to Council member’s questions, if any;
      (4)   Limit comments to the subjects under discussion, if agenda items;

request by the Mayor or presiding person, whose decision shall be subject to
objection by any member of the Council in which case the decision to extend

   127.01  CITY-ISSUED CREDIT/PURCHASING CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy it to ensure that City issued
credit cards and/or purchase cards are closely monitored to provide for maximum
security and to guard against misuse and/or losses for which the City may be
held liable. This policy is meant to comply with Ohio Revised Code 717.31 and
with the mandates of Sub HB 312 enacted by the 132nd General Assembly. City use
includes cases where a purchase order is not accepted for needed services,
supplies and/or materials, or are purchased from a vendor who issues a purchase
card to be used in conjunction with a purchase order. The City-issued cards are
NOT for personal use, and will not be permitted to be carried by personnel on a
regular basis for any reason. All City credit cards shall be in the name of the
“City of Trotwood, Ohio” and the department for which the card is authorized.
In special circumstances, a credit card may also include a specific
cardholder’s name.
   (b)   General Guidelines.
      (1)   The cards are to be kept in the control of the Finance Director.
The Finance Director or designee will secure the cards in a safe, or in a
locked cash box in a secure drawer.
      (2)   Each Director/Department Head must keep a master list of all
employees who are permitted to use City credit cards, along with each
employee’s title within their department. The list must be provided to the
Finance Department annually, or whenever changes are made. A copy of a master
list must be on file in the Finance Department and in the Human Resources
Office.
      (3)   A log of the card name and number showing date, sign out time, sign
in time, signature of person using the card, and valid purchase order number is
to be kept by the Finance Department. The authorized user must initial each
appropriate entry on the log indicating their acknowledgement of the card’s use
and the purchase. Anyone needing to use a card must go to the Finance
Department and sign the card in/out on this log.
      (4)   Regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed
whenever an authorized individual anticipates using the card. Every purchase
using any card must have a valid purchase order assigned to it before the
purchase is valid. The purchase order must contain the vendor (unless a multi-
vendor purchase order) and provide descriptions, account numbers and estimated
dollar amounts. No purchase shall exceed a spending limit of one thousand
dollars and no cents ($1,000.00) without the express written consent of the
appropriate Department Head or designee. This will ensure that sufficient
appropriations exist to cover the anticipated charges. Once a purchase is made,
simply return a copy of the P.O. along with the receipts you have accumulated,
directly to the Finance Department, to complete the transaction.
      (5)   Trotwood credit card accounts can be used for the following types
of purchases:
         A.   Travel Expenses. Credit cards may be used by authorized
individuals for official business-related expenditures for hotel, parking,
taxi, meals, gas, airline tickets, emergency City vehicle repairs, and other
travel-related expenses as authorized and preapproved by the Finance Director.
Under no circumstances can a city credit card be used to make expenditures for
the benefit of anyone other than the authorized city employee. Travel
expenditures shall not exceed those as outlined in the City’s existing Travel
Policy.
         B.   Purchases.  
            1.   The Trotwood credit card accounts shall have a standard
maximum credit limit of three thousand dollars ($3,000). Upon approval of the
Finance Director, temporary credit limits can be increased and/or decreased to
a level appropriate to address the particular circumstances or events.
            2.   Credit cards may be used for ordering supplies, including
online purchases, when pre-approved by the Department Head and the Finance
Director or designee.
            3.   Credit cards shall not be used, however, for cash advances or
personal purchases or expenses, and shall only be used to transact City
business.
            4.   The authorized users are liable in person and upon any
official bond the employee has given to the City to reimburse the City the
amount for which the employee does not provide itemized receipts in accordance
with the policy and procedure described herein.
   (c)   Compliance Officer Appointment and Responsibilities.
      (1)   Appointment. The City Manager shall appoint a city employee to
serve as Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer cannot be the Finance
Director or Clerk of Council. This employee may not use a credit card account
and may not authorize an officer or employee to use a credit card account.
      (2)   Responsibility. The compliance officer and City Council, at least
quarterly, shall review a summary of credit card expenses, the number of cards
and accounts issued, the number of active cards and accounts issued, the cards'
and accounts' expiration dates, and the cards' and accounts' credit limits.
   (d)   Finance Director Responsibilities.
      (1)   Determining positions authorized to use a credit card.
         A.   The Finance Director is responsible for administration of City
credit cards to include, but not limited to, selection of card provider,
payment of credit card bills, managing issuance of cards, and ensuring proper
use.
         B.   Whenever a City credit card holder suspects the loss, theft, or
possibility of unauthorized use of the card, the employee shall notify the
Finance Director in writing. The Finance Director, in turn, shall immediately
notify cardholder services to place a hold on the relevant account.
         C.   The Finance Director or designee should review, approve, and
determine when a credit card account will be opened. Cards may be used by City
employees only. Each card will be in the name of the City of Trotwood and the
Departments. Generally the following positions will be authorized to use a
credit card account:
            -    Mayor
            -    City Council Members
            -    Clerk of Council
            -    City Manager and/or Designee
            -    Deputy City Manager
            -    Finance Director and/or Designee
            -    Assistant Finance Director
            -    Police Chief and/or Designee
            -    Fire Chief and/or Designee

designees will:
         A.   Review all credit card transactions and management reports to
ensure that the cards are being used appropriately.
      (3)   Ensuring documentation requirements are met. Finance Director or
designees will:
         A.   Ensure necessary detail and documentation are provided on all
transactions.
         B.   Ensure that itemized receipts and card statements are retained
and kept in accordance with the City’s Records Retention Schedule.
   (e)   Rules and Procedures for Use.
      (1)   The card is for City approved expenses only. It must not be used
for personal purchases.
      (2)   The card is not transferable. It may be used by authorized city
employees only.
      (3)   Itemized receipts must be obtained for all transactions and
submitted to the Finance Director within seven (7) days of the transaction.
Itemized receipts should be attached to a form supplied by the Finance
Department and it is the responsibility of the card user to fill out the form
with all relevant information so that the Finance Department can easily
reconcile itemized receipts with the relevant purchase order.
      (4)   Pyramiding - i.e., dividing one purchase into two or more, in order
to stay within your transaction limit - is not allowed.
      (5)   Card users may not receive cash advances.
      (6)   Card users are responsible for resolving discrepancies and ensuring
credits are received.
      (7)   Card users may not receive cash back or in-store credits for any
refunds or exchanges. Such amounts must be credited to the credit card account.
If a supplier mistakenly issues a refund check, it must be submitted to the
Finance Department within five days of receipt by the cardholder.
      (8)   Card users should not pay Ohio sales tax. Card users are
responsible for obtaining/resolving sale tax exemptions, especially for
internet purchases. The cardholder must tell in-state suppliers the City is
exempt from Ohio sales tax. A copy of the City’s Tax Exempt Certificate is
available if the supplier needs to see it.
      (9)   If grant funds are being charged, cardholders are responsible for
seeing that all granting agency requirements are fulfilled.
      (10)   Card users may not make purchases that violate City policy
restricting business transactions that may be perceived as a conflict of
interest (purchases from a business in which you or a relative have a financial
interest).
   (f)   Documentation Requirements.
      (1)   Employees should always obtain an itemized receipt for each
transaction. If a cash register tape does not have descriptions, write them on
the tape. Any transaction without a properly substantiated receipt is subject
to reimbursement of the City by the employee.
      (2)   A receipt is defined as an invoice, cash register receipt, sales
slip, or packing slip which contains an itemized list of goods purchased, with
dollar amounts, and the name and location of the supplier. An employee of the
supplier must sign handwritten receipts.
         A.   Purchases Made in Person. Retain the itemized receipt in addition
to the credit card copy to properly substantiate the purchase.
         B.   Faxed or Mailed Purchases. Retain a copy of the order as faxed or
mailed and the fax confirmation (if available) for your records.
         C.   Internet Purchases. At least one of the following types of
documentation is required:
Print out of the completed online order form;
Print out of the online order confirmation; or
Print out of the e-mail confirmation.
   (g)   Preventing Fraud.
      (1)   The user must immediately advise the Finance Director if a card is
damaged, lost, stolen or the subject of suspected fraudulent activity.
      (2)   The card user should use basic security measures, as outlined
below, to guard against fraud:
         A.   DO keep the card in a secure location while using; guard the card
number carefully.
         B.   DO save receipts and statements securely. (They may contain the
card number).
         C.   DO keep an eye on the card during the transaction, and retrieve
it as soon as possible.
         D.   DO be aware of what you are signing: Your signature can copy
through to other slips deliberately placed underneath.
         E.   DO visit reputable, familiar merchants whenever possible.
         F.   DO report possible fraud immediately.
         G.   DO NOT discard credit card slips in public areas, or discard them
whole. Thieves can acquire your card number from receipts, slips and

requirements herein.

to be in violation of such Resolution.
   (b)   All complaints shall be by affidavit made of personal knowledge,
subject to the penalties of perjury. Complaints by the TEC shall be by
affidavit, based upon a reasonable cause to believe that a violation has
occurred. The TEC shall investigate charges presented to it. The TEC may
request further information, including the specific amount of income from a
source, from any person filing with the TEC if the information sought is
directly relevant to the complaint or charges received by the TEC pursuant to
this section. Such information is confidential.
      (1)   The person so requested shall furnish information to the TEC within
fifteen days from the date of the request unless the person files an action for
declaratory judgment challenging the legitimacy of the request to the County
Court of Common Pleas.
      (2)   The requested information need not be furnished to the TEC during

therewith shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise provided by this
section. Before the TEC proceeds to take any formal action against a person who

alleged in the complaint constitute a violation of Resolution 87-5, it shall
hold a hearing. If the TEC does not so find, it shall dismiss the complaint.
      (3)   The person against whom the complaint is directed shall be given
reasonable notice by certified mail of the date, time and place of a hearing, a

witnesses in his defense, to confront his accusers, and to cross examine
witnesses. The TEC shall have a stenographic record made of the hearing. The
hearing shall be closed to the public.
      (4)   If upon the basis of the hearing the TEC finds, based upon a
preponderance (defined as a greater weight) of the evidence, that the facts
alleged in the complaint are true and constitute a violation of Resolution 87-
5, it shall report its findings to the appropriate prosecuting authority for
proceedings and prosecution of the violations, in addition to having the right
to declare the seat of the Councilmember, board member and/or commission member
vacant, by resolution of Council, five members concurring, pursuant to Charter
Section
3-4.
      (5)   If the TEC does not find based upon a preponderance (defined as the
greater weight) of the evidence, that the facts alleged in the complaint are
true and constitute a violation of Resolution 87-5, or if the TEC has not
scheduled a hearing within thirty days after the complaint is filed, or has not
finally disposed of the complaint within six months, ninety days after it has
been heard, it shall dismiss the complaint; and upon the request of the accused
person, make a public report of the findings, but in such case all evidence and
the record of the hearing shall remain confidential unless the accused person
also requests that the evidence and record be made public. Upon request of the

public inspection.

and records. The TEC shall issue any such subpoena upon the request of the
accused person. Upon refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, or to be sworn
or to answer as a witness, the TEC may apply to the County Court of Common
Pleas under the appropriate section of State law. The Court shall hold
proceedings in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 2705. The TEC or the accused
person may take the deposition of witnesses residing within or without the
State in the same manner prescribed by law for the taking of depositions in a
civil action in the Common Pleas Court. The report of the TEC activities shall

relating to the proceedings shall be sealed in a private and confidential
manner, except as otherwise provided in this section.

months, which is one (1) day for not using any sick leave time for that (6)-
month period. Personal days under this section shall not be accumulated and
must be used within the following six (6) month period or may be taken as pay
at the employee's option. However, a personal day under this section which
cannot be scheduled within the appropriate six (6) month period due to the
operational needs of the department may be carried over for an additional six
(6) month period.
   (f)   Sick Leave Donation Program. This program is established so that
employees of the City of Trotwood may make voluntary donations of their earned
sick leave to other employees for humanitarian reasons, and is available to
those employees in need because of serious or catastrophic illness or injury,
and who have exhausted all other paid leave including sick, vacation, holiday,
and personal. This program does not supersede or replace other retirement or
disability programs. When the Human Resource Manager is made aware of the need
for sick leave donations, a notice will be posted advising all City employees
of this need. Any eligible employee may then voluntarily elect to contribute
permanently sick leave credits for this employee. The Following Criteria will
apply:
      (1)    Only regular, full-time, non-probationary, employees are eligible
to donate sick leave credits or to be a recipient of a donation. The employee
must have at least forty (40) sick leave credits (320 hours) accumulated at the
time of donation.
      (2)   A sick leave credit will be defined as eight (8) hours and will not
have an hourly rate attached.
      (3)   An employee may contribute only five (5) sick leave credits (40
hours) per year.
      (4)   A sick leave credit donation is permanent and therefore cannot be
returned to the donor or converted to cash by the donee's estate.
      (5)   The sick leave credits will be used in place of the employee's
regularly scheduled work days to the extent they are necessary.
      (6)   A donated sick leave credit will not count as a separate absence
for the donating employee.
      (7)   Donated sick leave credits can be used to cover retroactive unpaid
regularly scheduled work days.
      (8)   An employee will not accrue holiday pay, vacation, or sick leave
while receiving donated sick leave.
      (9)   An employee will be eligible for this program up to one year after
he/she has exhausted all accumulated paid sick leave (sick, vacation, and
personal).
      (10)   An employee's illness or disability must be certified by a
physician.
      (11)   When an employee is about to exhaust his own accumulated sick
leave a request for donated sick leave may be made in writing to the Manager.
The physician's certification must be attached to the request. The City will
determine eligibility for donations and that determination will be final.
Employees who have documented disciplinary action within the preceding three
(3) years of sick leave abuse are automatically ineligible for this program. If
it is determined that an employee is eligible to receive donated sick leave
credits, notice of need will be posted, and any eligible employee may donate
sick leave. An employee who voluntarily chooses to donate sick leave credits
must complete a Sick Leave Donation Form and submit it to the immediate
supervisor who will in turn submit this form to the Manager. A copy of the
donation form will be maintained in the donor's personnel file, and a copy to
payroll to deduct the credit from the employee's sick leave balance. (Ord. 08-
24. Passed 6-3-24.)

or not a tax be due thereon, make and file on or before April 15th of each
year, with the Tax Administrator a Municipal tax return on a form prescribed by

return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar
year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or period. The Tax
Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return of
an employer or employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said
employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation, and other taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by
him or them to the Tax Administrator may be accepted as the return required of
a nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code,
is such qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable
income.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator; or on
a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality's prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such earnings and
profits; and

federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this Chapter.
   (e)   (1)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer's federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)    The granting of an extension for filing a Municipai tax return
does not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the
tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period
of extension at the rate set out by Section
183.10. Any extension by the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the
condition that declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled;
however, if, upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration
filing and payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest
may be assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due.
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.06; and

taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
183.14 for tax paid to another municipality.

183.11 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
183.11. The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)    Within three (3) months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax
liability and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund
of any overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative, to
file the items required by this paragraph.

employee and shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return and
pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the
preceding month. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or

failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld and shown as withheld on the employee's W-2 year end statement
relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded
with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (d)   The Tax Administrator shall have the authority to approve the filing
of quarterly withholding payments. Upon approval, the employer shall, on or
before the last day of each month following the calendar quarters ending March
31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, make a return and pay the tax
withheld during the preceding calendar quarter. The Tax Administrator may
revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever the Tax
Administrator has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal
shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
   (e)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (f)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
183.99 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (g)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year. The Tax Administrator may require the
filing of such reconciliations and employee information by alternate media.
   (h)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.

   (d)   Amounts of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be collected or

should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within thirty (30)
days after the Tax Administrator has issued the decision.

appellant can show that the charges assessed were either unlawful or incorrect.

184.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
184.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
184.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month.
         (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the receding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars. The payment under division (B)(1)(c) of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than one of the
following:
            (i)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
            (iii)   The Tax Administrator may determine, by Administrative
Order, when semi-monthly withholding will be required.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
184.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent
the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
184.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
184.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
184.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

    (A)    The Municipality requires each a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and

agent conducting video lottery terminals on behalf of the state; and each type
B sports gaming proprietor facility or sports gaming proprietor, as those terms
are defined in section 3775.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, to withhold and remit
municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as
provided in this section and section 718.031 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   
   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility or sports gaming facility
are an amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount
is required by section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the
casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall deduct and withhold municipal
income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation in which the casino facility or sports gaming facility is
located.
   
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator or sports gaming
proprietor are held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to
which the tax is owed.
            (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino
operator or sports gaming proprietor shall file a return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality, providing the name, address, and
social security number of the person from whose winnings amounts were deducted
and withheld, the amount of each such deduction and withholding during the
preceding calendar month, the amount of the winnings from which each such
amount was withheld, the type of casino gaming or sports gaming that resulted
in such winnings, and any other information required by the Tax Administrator.
With this return, the casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
           (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a
casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall file an annual return
electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which
the casino facility or sports gaming proprietor is located, indicating the
total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The
casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall remit electronically with the
annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator or sports gaming proprietor shall issue an information return to each
person with respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of
municipal income tax deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding
year. The casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall provide to the Tax
Administrator a copy of each information return issued under this division. The
administrator may require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
            (4)    A casino operator or sports gaming proprietor that fails to
file a return and remit the amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally
liable for the amount withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability
extends to any penalty and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or
the late payment of tax deducted and withheld.
            (5)    If a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor sells the
casino facility or sports gaming facility or otherwise quits the casino or
sports gaming business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator or sports gaming proprietor produces
either of the following:
                 (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been
paid;
                  (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating
that no amounts are due.
                  If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
            (6)    The failure of a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor
to deduct and withhold the required amount from a person's winnings does not
relieve that person from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to
those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal or from
lottery sports gaming offered in a video lottery terminal facility is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
           (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from
whose prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the
amount deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a
prize award the person's name, address, and social security number in order to
facilitate the preparation of returns required by this section.
            (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
            (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
            (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld
and that was not previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security
number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
           (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a
video lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
            (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and
remit the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount
deducted and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any
penalty and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late
payment of tax deducted and withheld.
   
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
            (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been
paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
           If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   
   (H)    If a casino operator, sports gaming proprietor, or lottery sales
agent files a return late, fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and
withheld late, or fails to remit amounts deducted and withheld as required
under this section, the Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose
the following applicable penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and

annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 184.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
  
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
184.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
184.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
184.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
184.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
184.03 (32) of this Chapter.

184.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) and (I) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
184.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
184.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
184.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
184.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
184.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under section
184.051, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of section
184.051 apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this
division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(1) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
184.051.

184.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
184.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
184.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
184.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
184.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

184.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it
shall be measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the Municipality
derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit. (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax

         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;

Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
184.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
184.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
184.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

184.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
184.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   If a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal income tax
in another Ohio municipality as well as in this City, he shall not pay a total
municipal income tax (on the same income) greater than the tax imposed at the
highest rate to which he is subject.
   (B)   Every individual who resides in the Municipality who receives net
profits, qualifying wages, commissions or other taxable income for work done or
services performed or rendered outside the City of Trotwood, and who is liable
and has paid to another Ohio municipality an income tax on the same income
taxable and taxed under this chapter, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this chapter (on the same income to the extent such income is taxed
under this chapter) of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other
Ohio municipality. The credit shall not exceed the Trotwood tax imposed on the
income earned in the other municipality(ies) where such tax is paid. The amount
of income reported on federal Schedules C, E, and F, earned in and taxed by a
given Ohio municipality (as a percentage of total income reported on federal
Schedules C, E, and F, attributable to taxing and non-taxing jurisdictions)
shall be used to determine each municipality's contribution to Trotwood net
profits taxable income, prior to calculation of the resident City credit for
taxes paid to other Ohio municipalities on net profit income. The rate to be
used for calculation of this credit shall be the lesser of the resident City
tax rate or the appropriate rate at which such income was taxed by such other
Ohio municipality. The resident City credit(s) for taxes paid to another Ohio
municipality(ies) on net profit income shall be calculated as follows:
   Trotwood net profits taxable income ($) X municipality contribution (%) X
tax rate (%) = allowable credit.
(Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
184.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
184.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
184.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
184.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
184.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
   
184.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
184.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
184.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
184.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
184.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
184.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is an individual
shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable
year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1,
2023, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return for a taxpayer

   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A), (B), (C), or (E) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section 184.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.

under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
184.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
184.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
184.10 of this Chapter.

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
184.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
184.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
184.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
184.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
184.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
184.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 03-18. Passed 2-5-18; Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

an apartment, room or other rental property within the Municipality.
   (B)   Within thirty (30) days after a new tenant occupies rental property of
any kind within the Municipality, all owners of rental property who rent to

address and telephone number, if available, of each such tenant who occupies an
apartment, room or other rental property within the Municipality.

184.22 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
184.22 to
184.37 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this Chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
184.23(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
184.22 to
184.37, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City of Trotwood, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of Trotwood of
its termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
184.22 to
184.37, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
this Chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
184.22 to
184.37. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the tax commissioner by
law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
184.03 of the City of Trotwood Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-
18.)
184.23 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
 184.22 to
184.37 that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then the
use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Revised Code,
unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, in which case
the definition in that Chapter shall control. Any reference in this Chapter to
the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to
federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and section
 184.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term
in sections
184.22 to
184.37.
   As used in sections
184.22 to
184.37 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
184.24, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
 184.03, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
184.28.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
184.28.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of section
 184.03, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (23)(E) of section
184.03, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and
other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use
of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to
a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the
taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
184.03(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
184.22 to
184.37 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this Chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
184.22 to
184.37 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
184.32.
      (Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.24  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Trotwood and that has made the election under section
184.22.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Trotwood shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City of Trotwood for purposes of municipal income taxation in the
same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Trotwood during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Trotwood to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or
profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding
compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under section

184.37 or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the following penalties shall
apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
 184.22 to
184.37 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner, the commissioner may
impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per month or fraction of a
month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date,
including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return is
filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall not
exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
184.22 to
184.37 fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the
following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
184.22 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
Chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per cent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
184.22 to
184.37 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of sections
184.22 to
184.37 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
184.22 to
184.37, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
184.33, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under section
184.32 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
184.22 to
184.37 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.32 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
184.22 to
184.37 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the commissioner's possession. The tax commissioner
shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer more than three years
after the later of the date the return subject to assessment was required to be
filed or the date the return was filed. Such time limit may be extended if both
the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such
extension shall extend the three-year time limit in section
184.33 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by sections
184.22 to
184.37, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
184.33, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.33  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
184.22 to
 184.37, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (A) of section
184.33. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-
5-18.)
184.34 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
184.22 and used to determine the tax due under sections
184.22 to
 184.37 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal
revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under
those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the tax
commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended return
shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or
finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income
tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has
been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
184.32 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
 184.33, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
section
184.33. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return. (Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-
5-18.)
184.35 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
184.22 to
184.37 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to
investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
184.22 to
184.37 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division docs not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 04-18. Passed 2-5-18.)
184.36 CREDITS.

pursuant to section
 184.064 or

which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City of Trotwood and taxpayer under section
184.064 or
184.065, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.

of Trotwood from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.

184.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or

the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left

When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief

this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.

one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by

the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable. The
owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise

   (b)   Civil Enforcement System Established.
      (1)   General. The City hereby adopts the use of traffic law photo-
monitoring devices to detect and enforce violations of applicable speed limits
in selected intersections. The City shall operate this system in compliance
with all pertinent requirements and limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter

      (3)   System Locations. Traffic law photo-monitoring devices may be
deployed within the City of Trotwood. The Trotwood Police Department or its
designee shall maintain a list of system locations where traffic law photo-
monitoring devices are installed. Said department, with concurrence of City

file with the City of Trotwood Police Department.
   (c)   Offense.
      (1)   Failure to Comply with Traffic Control Indications: Civil Fine. The
registered owner of a vehicle that is recorded by a traffic law photo-
monitoring device crossing a marked stop line or intersection plane at a system
location when the traffic signal for that vehicle's direction is emitting a
steady red light shall be assessed a civil penalty of one hundred ten dollars
($110.00) for which no points authorized by Ohio Revised Code Section 4507.021
shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the vehicle.
      (2)   Evidence of Ownership. It is prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles,
or with any other State vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle
at the time of the offense set out in division (c)(1) of this section.
      (3)   Issuing Ticket. Any ticket for a traffic violation set forth in
this section shall be issued in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4511.096, as follows:
         A.   A City of Trotwood police officer shall examine evidence of
alleged traffic law violations recorded by the system to determine whether a
violation has occurred. If the image(s) recorded by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device shows a violation, contains the date and time of the
violation, and shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the
vehicle involved as well as the state that issued the license plate, the
officer may use any lawful means to identify the registered owner.
         B.   Within thirty (30) days of the traffic law violation, the City or
its designee will file the ticket with the Municipal Court of Montgomery County
Western Division in compliance with the Court's rules and regulations relating
to such tickets. The Court may then issue and send by regular mail or other
methods consistent with the Court's rules, a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation.
         C.   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation,
sworn to or affirmed by a City of Trotwood police officer, including by
electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and
is admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this
section.
      (4)   Content of Ticket. Any ticket issued pursuant to this section shall
contain the following information, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.097:
         A.   The name and address of the registered owner;
         B.   The letters and numerals appearing on the license plate issued to
the motor vehicle;
         C.   The traffic law violation charged;
         D.   The system location;
         E.   The date and time of the violation;
         F.   A copy of the recorded images;
         G.   The amount of the civil penalty imposed, the date by which the
civil penalty is required to be paid, and the court address to which the
payment is to be sent;
         H.   A statement signed by a City of Trotwood police officer
indicating that, based on an inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle
was involved in a traffic law violation, and a statement indicating that the
recorded images are prima facie evidence of that traffic law violation both of
which may be signed electronically;
         I.   Information advising the person or entity alleged to be liable of
the options prescribed in division (d)(1) of this section, specifically to
include the time, place, and manner in which an appeal may be initiated and the
procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in
that subsection;
         J.   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in division (d)(1) of this section is deemed to be an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (5)   Payments: Default Fees. The amount of the penalty shall be paid
within thirty (30) days from the mailing date of the ticket. If the amount of
the penalty is not paid within this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be
imposed as a default fee. Failure to pay the penalty and the twenty-dollar
($20.00) default fee within sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of the
ticket will result in the imposition of an additional twenty-dollar ($20.00)
default fee, bringing the default fee to forty dollars ($40.00). Failure to pay
the penalty and the forty-dollar ($40.00) default fee within ninety (90) days
from the date of mailing of the ticket will result in an additional twenty-
dollar ($20.00) default fee, bringing the default fee to the total amount of
sixty dollars ($60.00), and-the unpaid penalty and default fee being forwarded
for collection.
      (6)   Default and Collection. Failure to timely elect and perform one of
the options contained in division (d)(1) of this section shall constitute an
admission of the violation and a waiver of the opportunity to contest the
violation. Further, if the registered owner or operator fails to pay the
penalty within the period set forth in division (c)(5) of this section, the
penalty, along with the additional late fee(s), may be collected by civil suit
or other appropriate means of collection.
      (7)   Other Offenses and Penalties Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting Sections
333.03 or
 313.03 of these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police officer to enforce those sections against
any offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an
operator of a vehicle for any violation of division (c)(1) of this section.
   (d)   Contesting Ticket.
      (1)   Options Upon Receipt of Ticket. Consistent with Ohio R.C. 4511.098,
a recipient of a ticket shall elect to do one of the following:
         A.   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
         B.   Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, provide the
Court with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within forty-eight
(48) hours after the violation occurred.
         C.   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the court of the name and address of the
lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
The court shall establish the form of the notice. A motor vehicle leasing
dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged
traffic law violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not
liable for a ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody,
or control of a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation. The
dealer shall not pay such a ticket and subsequently attempt to collect a fee or
assess the lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a ticket made on
behalf of the lessee or renter;
         D.   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the Court an affidavit, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the
corporate entity, that provides the name and address of the employee who was
operating the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is the
designated party;
         E.   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for a hearing to
review the ticket. The person or entity shall file the written request not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket. The failure to request
a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of the right to contest
the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (2)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the
registered owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (d)(1)B.1. or 2.
of this section to the Court in a form established by the Court and the
following conditions are met:
         A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request a
hearing within thirty (30) days or is determined liable in hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.2. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the Court timely receives an affidavit described in division (d)
(1)B.1. or (d)(1)D. of this section or a notification under division (d)(1)C.
of this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket to the
designated party. The Court shall send the ticket to the designated party by
ordinary mail not later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the
affidavit or notification.
      (4)   Hearing: Procedures.
         A.   When a person or entity named in a ticket elects to contest the
ticket and completes the requirements prescribed in division (d) (1)E. of this
section in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
            1.   The Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division
shall hear the case. The Court shall conduct a hearing not sooner than twenty-
one (21) but not later than forty-five (45) days after the filing of a written
request for the hearing. The Court may extend the time period by which a
hearing must be conducted upon a request for additional time by the person or
entity who requested the hearing.
            2.   The Court shall ensure that the hearing is open to the public.
The Court shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the
hearing room. The Court shall identify on the docket, by respondent, the
hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each hearing. The Court may
schedule multiple hearings for the same time to allow for occurrences such as
nonappearances or admissions of liability.
            3.   The person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the hearing and may
present evidence at the hearing.
            4.   The Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur
and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
         B.   1.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that
the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court
costs and imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity
and submit it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the
ticket.
            2.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but the person
or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating the vehicle
at the time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision finding
that the individual or entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to
the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            3.   If the person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the Court
shall determine that the person or entity is liable for the violation. In such
a case, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court costs and
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            4.   The Court shall render a decision on the day a hearing takes
place.
            5.   Court costs shall be set by the Montgomery County Municipal
Court.
         C.   1.   The Court may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a traffic law violation provided herein:
               a.   The motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within forty-eight (48) hours after the traffic law
violation occurred.
               b.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation,
the traffic law photo-monitoring device was not in proper position and the
recorded image is not of sufficient legibility to enable an accurate
determination of the information necessary to impose liability.
               c.   The registered owner or person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation. In order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division,
the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket shall provide to
the Court the identity of the designated party, that person's name and current
address, and any other evidence that the Court determines to be pertinent.
            2.   The Court also may consider the totality of the circumstances
when determining whether to assess court costs and/or to impose liability upon
the person or entity named in the ticket.
         D.   1.   If the Court finds that the person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the Court
shall provide to the City or its designee, within five (5) days of the hearing,
a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated party.
            2.   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of evidence of the identity
of the designated party, the City or its designee will file the ticket with the
Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division in compliance with the
Court's rules and regulations relating to such tickets. The Court may then
issue and send by regular mail or other methods consistent with the Court's
rules, a ticket charging the designated party with the violation.
         E.   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under this section
contests the ticket by filing a written request for an hearing to review the
ticket not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, the Court
shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the
hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the Court cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The Court then
shall issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation on the
registered owner. If the designated party also is a registered owner of the
vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of registered
owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
         F.   A person who is named in a ticket for a traffic violation under
this section may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C.
2317.02(D).
         G.   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of
liability under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.098, is admissible as evidence
in any other judicial proceeding in this state.

the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these
subsections. (ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or

(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical

      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
 303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative

convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or four violations of subsection (a) of
this section or other equivalent offenses or an offender who, within twenty
years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
five or more violations of that nature, or an offender who previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a specification of the type described in Ohio
R.C. 2941.1413, is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state
law.
         E.   An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The cumulative total of the five consecutive
days in jail and the period of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
continuous alcohol monitoring, or both types of monitoring shall not exceed six
months. The five consecutive days in jail do not have to be served prior to or

penalties provided by law, shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times
the usual amount imposed for the violation. No court shall impose a fine of two
times the usual amount imposed for the violation upon an offender if the
offender alleges, in an affidavit filed with the court prior to the offender’s
sentencing, that the offender is indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed
pursuant to this subsection and if the court determines that the offender is an
indigent person and unable to pay the fine.

are responding to emergency calls and are equipped with and displaying at least
one flashing, rotating or oscillating light visible under normal atmospheric
conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of the vehicle and when the

one hundred ten dollars ($110.00) for which no points authorized by Ohio
Revised Code Section 4507.021 shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the
vehicle.
      (2)   Evidence of Ownership. It is prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles,
or with any other State vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle
at the time of the offense set out in division (c)(1) of this section.
      (3)   Issuing Ticket. Any ticket for a traffic violation set forth in
this section shall be issued in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4511.096, as follows:
         A.   A City of Trotwood police officer shall examine evidence of
alleged traffic law violations recorded by the system to determine whether a
violation has occurred. If the image(s) recorded by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device shows a violation, contains the date and time of the
violation, and shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the
vehicle involved as well as the state that issued the license plate, the
officer may use any lawful means to identify the registered owner.
         B.   Within thirty (30) days of the traffic law violation, the City or
its designee will file the ticket with the Municipal Court of Montgomery County
Western Division in compliance with the Court's rules and regulations relating
to such tickets. The Court may then issue and send by regular mail or other
methods consistent with the Court's rules, a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation.
         C.   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation,
sworn to or affirmed by a City of Trotwood police officer, including by
electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and
is admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this
section.

contain the following information, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.097:
         A.   The name and address of the registered owner;

indicating that, based on an inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle
was involved in a traffic law violation, and a statement indicating that the
recorded images are prima facie evidence of that traffic law violation both of
which may be signed electronically;
         I.   Information advising the person or entity alleged to be liable of
the options prescribed in division (d)(1) of this section, specifically to
include the time, place, and manner in which an appeal may be initiated and the
procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in
that subsection;
         J.   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in division (d)(1) of this section is deemed to be an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (5)   Payments: Default Fees. The amount of the penalty shall be paid
within thirty (30) days from the mailing date of the ticket. If the amount of
the penalty is not paid within this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be
imposed as a default fee. Failure to pay the penalty and the twenty-dollar
($20.00) default fee within sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of the
ticket will result in the imposition of an additional twenty-dollar ($20.00)
default fee, bringing the default fee to forty dollars ($40.00). Failure to pay
the penalty and the forty-dollar ($40.00) default fee within ninety (90) days
from the date of mailing of the ticket will result in an additional twenty-
dollar ($20.00) default fee, bringing the default fee to the total amount of
sixty dollars ($60.00), and-the unpaid penalty and default fee being forwarded
for collection.
      (6)   Default and Collection. Failure to timely elect and perform one of
the options contained in division (d)(1) of this section shall constitute an
admission of the violation and a waiver of the opportunity to contest the
violation. Further, if the registered owner or operator fails to pay the
penalty within the period set forth in division (c)(5) of this section, the
penalty, along with the additional late fee(s), may be collected by civil suit
or other appropriate means of collection.
      (7)   Other Offenses and Penalties Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting Sections
333.03 or
313.03 of these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police officer to enforce those sections against
any offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an
operator of a vehicle for any violation of division (c)(1) of this section.
   (d)   Contesting Ticket.
      (1)   Options Upon Receipt of Ticket. Consistent with Ohio R.C. 4511.098,
a recipient of a ticket shall elect to do one of the following:
         A.   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
         B.   Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, provide the
Court with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within forty-eight
(48) hours after the violation occurred.
         C.   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the court of the name and address of the
lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
The court shall establish the form of the notice. A motor vehicle leasing
dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged
traffic law violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not
liable for a ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody,
or control of a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation. The
dealer shall not pay such a ticket and subsequently attempt to collect a fee or
assess the lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a ticket made on
behalf of the lessee or renter;
         D.   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the Court an affidavit, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the
corporate entity, that provides the name and address of the employee who was
operating the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is the
designated party;
         E.   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for a hearing to
review the ticket. The person or entity shall file the written request not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket. The failure to request
a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of the right to contest
the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (2)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within 30 days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (d)(1)B.1. or 2. of this
section to the Court in a form established by the Court and the following
conditions are met:
         A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request a
hearing within thirty (30) days or is determined liable in hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.2. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the Court timely receives an affidavit described in division (d)
(1)B.1. or (d)(1)D. of this section or a notification under division (d)(1)C.
of this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket to the
designated party. The Court shall send the ticket to the designated party by
ordinary mail not later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the
affidavit or notification.
      (4)   Hearing: Procedures.
         A.   When a person or entity named in a ticket elects to contest the
ticket and completes the requirements prescribed in division (d) (1)E. of this
section in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
            1.   The Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division
shall hear the case. The Court shall conduct a hearing not sooner than twenty-
one (21) but not later than forty-five (45) days after the filing of a written
request for the hearing. The Court may extend the time period by which a
hearing must be conducted upon a request for additional time by the person or
entity who requested the hearing.
            2.   The Court shall ensure that the hearing is open to the public.
The Court shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the
hearing room. The Court shall identify on the docket, by respondent, the
hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each hearing. The Court may
schedule multiple hearings for the same time to allow for occurrences such as
nonappearances or admissions of liability.
            3.   The person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the hearing and may
present evidence at the hearing.
            4.   The Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur
and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
         B.   1.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that
the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court
costs and imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity
and submit it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the
ticket.
            2.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but the person
or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating the vehicle
at the time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision finding
that the individual or entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to
the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            3.   If the person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the Court
shall determine that the person or entity is liable for the violation. In such
a case, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court costs and
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            4.   The Court shall render a decision on the day a hearing takes
place.
            5.   Court costs shall be set by the Montgomery County Municipal
Court.
         C.   1.   The Court may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a traffic law violation provided herein:
               a.   The motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within forty-eight (48) hours after the traffic law
violation occurred.
               b.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation,
the traffic law photo-monitoring device was not in proper position and the
recorded image is not of sufficient legibility to enable an accurate
determination of the information necessary to impose liability.
               c.   The registered owner or person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation. In order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division,
the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket shall provide to
the Court the identity of the designated party, that person's name and current
address, and any other evidence that the Court determines to be pertinent.
            2.   The Court also may consider the totality of the circumstances
when determining whether to assess court costs and/or to impose liability upon
the person or entity named in the ticket.
         D.   1.   If the Court finds that the person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the Court
shall provide to the City or its designee, within five (5) days of the hearing,
a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated party.
            2.   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of evidence of the identity
of the designated party, the City or its designee will file the ticket with the
Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division in compliance with the
Court's rules and regulations relating to such tickets. The Court may then
issue and send by regular mail or other methods consistent with the Court's
rules, a ticket charging the designated party with the violation.
         E.   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under this section
contests the ticket by filing a written request for an hearing to review the
ticket not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, the Court
shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the
hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the Court cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The Court then
shall issue a written decision assessing court costs and imposing liability for
the violation on the registered owner. If the designated party also is a
registered owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
         F.   A person who is named in a ticket for a traffic violation under
this section may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C.
2317.02(D).
         G.   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of
liability under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.098, is admissible as evidence
in any other judicial proceeding in this state.
            (Ord. 25-20. Passed 12-7-20.)

permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.

Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar

333.11 CIVIL PENALTIES FOR HAND-HELD SPEEDING SYSTEM VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Definitions. As used in this section, the meanings of applicable terms
are as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.092. In addition, the term "System" may be
used interchangeably with the term "hand-held speeding system." A "hand-held
speeding system" is a system consisting of a photographic, video or electronic
camera and a vehicle sensor that produces a photograph, video or digital image
of speed limit violations.
   (b)   Civil Enforcement System Established.
      (1)   General. The City hereby adopts the use of traffic law photo-
monitoring devices to detect and enforce violations of applicable speed limits
in selected areas. The City shall operate this system in compliance with all
pertinent requirements and limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 4511. A
violation of this section shall be deemed a civil violation for which a fine is
assessed. No points shall be assessed against the operating record of any
person on whom liability is imposed under this section.
      (2)   Prerequisites to System Deployment. The City of Trotwood Police
Department shall ensure the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4511.094 and R.C.
4511.095 are met prior to deploying any traffic law photo-monitoring device.
      (3)   System Locations. Hand-Held speeding systems may be deployed within
the City of Trotwood. The Trotwood Police Department or its designee shall make
the determination as to which locations will be utilized. The street locations
chosen for hand-held speeding system under this section must display a speed
limit sign in compliance with Ohio Department of Transportation Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices §§2B.11 and 2B.15 and the Ohio Revised Code
§4511.21.
      (4)   Program Oversight. The City of Trotwood Police Department shall
oversee the program authorized by this section.
      (5)   Rules and Regulations. The City of Trotwood Police Department may
issue rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section, which
shall be effective thirty (30) days after being posted at the Council office.
The rules and regulations may also be published on the City website and kept on
file with the City of Trotwood Police Department.
   (c)   Offense.
      (1)   Speeding Violation: Civil Fine. The registered owner of a vehicle
that is recorded by a hand-held speeding system being operated at a speed in
excess of posted speed limit in violation of Section
333.03 of the Trotwood Code of Ordinances shall be assessed a civil penalty of
one hundred ten dollars ($110.00) for which no points authorized by Ohio
Revised Code Section 4507.021 shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the
vehicle.
      (2)   Evidence of Ownership. It is prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles,
or with any other State vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle
at the time of the offense set out in division (c)(1) of this section.
      (3)   Issuing Ticket. Any ticket for a traffic violation set forth in
this section shall be issued in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4511.096, as follows:
         A.   A City of Trotwood police officer shall examine evidence of
alleged traffic law violations recorded by the system to determine whether a
violation has occurred. If the image(s) recorded by the hand-held speeding
system shows a violation, contains the date and time of the violation, and
shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the vehicle involved as
well as the state that issued the license plate, the officer may use any lawful
means to identify the registered owner.
         B.   Within thirty (30) days of the traffic law violation, the City or
its designee will file the ticket with the Municipal Court of Montgomery County
Western Division in compliance with the Court's rules and regulations relating
to such tickets. The Court may then issue and send by regular mail or other
methods consistent with the Court's rules, a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation.
         C.   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation,
sworn to or affirmed by a City of Trotwood police officer, including by
electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the hand-held speeding
system, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and is
admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this section.
      (4)   Content of Ticket. Any ticket issued pursuant to this section shall
contain the following information, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.097:
         A.   The name and address of the registered owner;
         B.   The letters and numerals appearing on the license plate issued to
the motor vehicle;
         C.   The traffic law violation charged;
         D.   The system location;
         E.   The date and time of the violation;
         F.   A copy of the recorded images;
         G.   The amount of the civil penalty imposed, the date by which the
civil penalty is required to be paid, and the court address to which the
payment is to be sent;
         H.   A statement signed by a City of Trotwood police officer
indicating that, based on an inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle
was involved in a traffic law violation, and a statement indicating that the
recorded images are prima facie evidence of that traffic law violation both of
which may be signed electronically;
         I.   Information advising the person or entity alleged to be liable of
the options prescribed in division (d)(1) of this section, specifically to
include the time, place, and manner in which an appeal may be initiated and the
procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in
that subsection;
         J.   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in division (d)(1) of this section is deemed to be an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (5)   Payments: Default Fees. The amount of the penalty shall be paid
within thirty (30) days from the mailing date of the ticket. If the amount of
the penalty is not paid within this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be
imposed as a default fee. Failure to pay the penalty and the twenty-dollar
($20.00) default fee within sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of the
ticket will result in the imposition of an additional twenty-dollar ($20.00)
default fee, bringing the default fee to forty dollars ($40.00). Failure to pay
the penalty and the forty-dollar ($40.00) default fee within ninety (90) days
from the date of mailing of the ticket will result in an additional twenty-
dollar ($20.00) default fee, bringing the default fee to the total amount of
sixty dollars ($60.00), and-the unpaid penalty and default fee being forwarded
for collection.
      (6)   Default and Collection. Failure to timely elect and perform one of
the options contained in division (d)(1) of this section shall constitute an
admission of the violation and a waiver of the opportunity to contest the
violation. Further, if the registered owner or operator fails to pay the
penalty within the period set forth in division (c)(5) of this section, the
penalty, along with the additional late fee(s), may be collected by civil suit
or other appropriate means of collection.
      (7)   Other Offenses and Penalties Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting Sections
333.03 or
313.03 of these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police officer to enforce those sections against
any offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an
operator of a vehicle for any violation of division (c)(1) of this section.
   (d)   Contesting Ticket.
      (1)   Options Upon Receipt of Ticket. Consistent with Ohio R.C. 4511.098,
a recipient of a ticket shall elect to do one of the following:
         A.   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
         B.   Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, provide the
Court with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within 48 hours
after the violation occurred.
         C.   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the court of the name and address of the
lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
The court shall establish the form of the notice. A motor vehicle leasing
dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged
traffic law violation detected by a hand-held speeding system is not liable for
a ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control
of a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation. The dealer shall
not pay such a ticket and subsequently attempt to collect a fee or assess the
lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a ticket made on behalf of
the lessee or renter;
         D.   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the Court an affidavit, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the
corporate entity, that provides the name and address of the employee who was
operating the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is the
designated party;
         E.   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for a hearing to
review the ticket. The person or entity shall file the written request not
later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket. The failure to request
a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of the right to contest
the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (2)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the
registered owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (d)(1)B.1. or 2.
of this section to the Court in a form established by the Court and the
following conditions are met:
         A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request a
hearing within thirty (30) days or is determined liable in hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(1)B.2. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the Court timely receives an affidavit described in division (d)
(1)B.1. or (d)(1)D. of this section or a notification under division (d)(1)C.
of this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket to the
designated party. The Court shall send the ticket to the designated party by
ordinary mail not later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the
affidavit or notification.
      (4)   Hearing: Procedures.
         A.   When a person or entity named in a ticket elects to contest the
ticket and completes the requirements prescribed in division (d) (1)E. of this
section in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
            1.   The Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division
shall hear the case. The Court shall conduct a hearing not sooner than twenty-
one (21) but not later than forty-five (45) days after the filing of a written
request for the hearing. The Court may extend the time period by which a
hearing must be conducted upon a request for additional time by the person or
entity who requested the hearing.
            2.   The Court shall ensure that the hearing is open to the public.
The Court shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the
hearing room. The Court shall identify on the docket, by respondent, the
hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each hearing. The Court may
schedule multiple hearings for the same time to allow for occurrences such as
nonappearances or admissions of liability.
            3.   The person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the hearing and may
present evidence at the hearing.
            4.   The Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur
and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
         B.   1.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that
the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court
costs and imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity
and submit it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the
ticket.
            2.   If the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but the person
or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating the vehicle
at the time of the violation, the Court shall issue a written decision finding
that the individual or entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to
the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            3.   If the person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the Court
shall determine that the person or entity is liable for the violation. In such
a case, the Court shall issue a written decision assessing court costs and
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the City or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
            4.   The Court shall render a decision on the day a hearing takes
place.
            5.   Court costs shall be set by the Montgomery County Municipal
Court.
         C.   1.   The Court may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a traffic law violation provided herein:
               a.   The motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within forty-eight (48) hours after the traffic law
violation occurred.
               b.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation,
hand-held speeding system was not in proper position and the recorded image is
not of sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the
information necessary to impose liability.
               c.   The registered owner or person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation. In order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division,
the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket shall provide to
the Court the identity of the designated party, that person's name and current
address, and any other evidence that the Court determines to be pertinent.
            2.   The Court also may consider the totality of the circumstances
when determining whether to assess court costs and/or to impose liability upon
the person or entity named in the ticket.
         D.   1.   If the Court finds that the person or entity named in the
ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the Court
shall provide to the City or its designee, within five (5) days of the hearing,
a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated party.
            2.   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of evidence of the identity
of the designated party, the City or its designee will file the ticket with the
Municipal Court of Montgomery County Western Division in compliance with the
Court's rules and regulations relating to such tickets. The Court may then
issue and send by regular mail or other methods consistent with the Court's
rules, a ticket charging the designated party with the violation.
         E.   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under this section
contests the ticket by filing a written request for an hearing to review the
ticket not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket, the Court
shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the
hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the Court cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The Court then
shall issue a written decision assessing court costs and imposing liability for
the violation on the registered owner. If the designated party also is a
registered owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
         F.   A person who is named in a ticket for a traffic violation under
this section may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C.
2317.02(D).
         G.   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of
liability under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.098, is admissible as evidence
in any other judicial proceeding in this state.

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
         B.   Whoever violates subsection (a)(4) or (5) of this section is

         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

municipal ordinance shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action
that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. (ORC 2901.04)
501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.

network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);

($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the

eighty days;

section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a

is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of                                       Maximum

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
 545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its

557.02   Definitions.
557.03   Prohibited acts.
557.04   Prohibit possession of graffiti implements.
557.05   Furnishing graffiti implements to minors prohibited.
557.06   Rapid removal of graffiti.
557.99   Penalty.
557.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   The purpose of this Section is to prevent the spread of graffiti in the City
through measures reasonably calculated to deter graffiti and to encourage and
facilitate rapid removal when it occurs.
   The City makes the following findings in enacting this Chapter:
   (a)   Graffiti is a form of vandalism defacing public and private property
without the consent of the owner;
   (b)   Graffiti creates visual pollution and blight that adversely affects
the enjoyment and value of public and private property and causes citizens,
businesses and the City to incur the cost of removal and repair;
   (c)   Graffiti is a visual symbol of disorder and lawlessness. In
contributes to a downward spiral of blight and decay, decreasing property
values, lessening business viability and potentially adversely affecting tax
revenues; and
   (d)   There is substantial evidence that rapid removal of graffiti is an
effective prevention strategy that discourages its return. In addition, there
is substantial evidence that failure to promptly remove graffiti increases the
likelihood that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby
property.

559.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)    Chronic nuisance properties present health, safety, and welfare
concerns to the City, and have a negative impact upon the quality of life,
safety and health of the neighborhoods in which they are located. This chapter
is enacted to remedy nuisance activities that occur throughout the City and
affect citizens by providing a process for abatement.
   (b)    Chronic nuisance properties are a financial burden to the City due to
the calls for service for nuisance activities that occur repeatedly on these
properties. This chapter is a means to lessen that burden and hold accountable
those persons responsible for such properties.

      (2)    A statement detailing the nature of the nuisances, the estimated

the costs of abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in this section.
      (3)    A statement that if a third or subsequent nuisance activity or
second felony drug activity as declared in this section occurs within six
months of the dates of the first two nuisance activities or first felony drug
activity, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities using
administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement

   (d)    If within six months after the two nuisances or the first felony drug
activity referred to in division (a) of this section has occurred, a third
nuisance activity or second felony drug activity as declared in this section
occurs, the City shall notify the owner that the property has been deemed a
chronic nuisance property and direct the owner to abate the nuisance. If the
owner has not done so within thirty days, the City may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions.
      (1)    Notice shall be posted on the premises or at the site of the
nuisance directing the responsible party to abate the nuisance. A copy of the

of Police or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Director of Public
Safety within thirty days of the date of the notice. If the Director finds that
the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Direction
shall rescind the notice. Otherwise, the Director shall deny the request and
refer the appeal for hearing by the Director of Public Safety under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506. Any such appeal shall not stay any actions by the City to abate
any subsequent nuisance activity.

      (1)    He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice;
      (2)    He or she has knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly

drug activity or as a result of the third nuisance/second felony drug activity,
the City shall not deem the property a chronic nuisance. (Ord. 16-19. Passed 7-
1-19.)
559.06 IMPACT.
   (a)    Once a property has been determined to be a chronic nuisance
property, the owner of that property shall be charged for the actual cost of
each subsequent service by the City for a nuisance or felony drug activity for
that property.
   (b)    The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall also assess a civil
penalty against an owner who violates any provision of his chapter or fails to
obey any order to abate a chronic nuisance. Assessments for nuisance activities
shall be imposed based on the number of nuisance or felony drug activities that
occur on that property after it has been deemed a chronic nuisance property.
The assessment shall be issued as follows:
      (1)    For the first nuisance or felony drug activity, a civil penalty
against the owner of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be imposed;
      (2)    For the second nuisance or felony drug activity, a civil penalty
against the owner of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) shall be imposed;

against the owner of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be imposed;

imposed;

civil penalty against the owner of one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be
imposed;
   (c)    The determination that a premises is a chronic nuisance subject to
remittance for the cost of enforcement pursuant to this section and subject to
civil penalties or criminal prosecution pursuant to this chapter shall be
effective for a two year period beginning with the date the property is
declared to be a chronic nuisance property.
      (1)    If, at any point during that two year period, another nuisance
activity or felony drug activity occurs at the property, the two year period
shall restart from the date of that activity. The two year period shall restart
for any subsequent nuisance or felony drug activity.
   (d)    In addition to other relief ordered, a court of competent
jurisdiction may authorize the City to physically secure the property against
all access, use or occupancy in the event that the owner fails to do so within
the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is authorized to
secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the City to physically
secure the property shall be paid to the City by the owner and may be included
in the City’s money judgment, including court costs. The court may, in its
discretion, award attorney fees to the prevailing party.
(Ord. 16-19. Passed 7-1-19.)

or the assessment of costs by the City on a property do not affect or limit the
City’s right to bring a criminal prosecution or other legal action against any
person for violation of the City’s ordinances or the Ohio Revised Code,
including those provided for in Ohio R.C. 3767.06.

hereof and multiplying the result by the percentage specified in subsection (d)
(1)A. or B. hereof.

1332.30(F), and the Federal Communication Commission user fee;
         B.   Uncollectible charges, except that uncollectible charges, all or
part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;

pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City of Trotwood.

the City of Trotwood Table of Fees established by Resolution of Council.
These fees shall be in addition to any criminal penalties imposed under Section
707.99. Such charges shall continue for each successive false alarm until six
consecutive months have elapsed during which time no false alarms have been
recorded. At that time the record will be cleared and the next false alarm
shall be deemed to be the first such incident. The question of whether a false
alarm has occurred may be appealed by the alarm user under the applicable
procedures set forth later in Section
707.18 by an alarm user who has been assessed a false alarm administrative fee.
   (b)   The permit issued to an alarm user may be revoked with the result that

measures that were taken.
   (d)   An alarm system may be reconnected only if satisfactory evidence is
provided to the Chief of Police that the alarm system has been repaired so that
it does not emit further false alarms and upon payment of all delinquent
charges assessed for false alarms.
      (Ord. 10-22. Passed 4-4-22.)

   (a)   Entrance-Exit Device. All alarm installations incorporating an
entrance/exit device must permit a delay of twenty seconds minimum before

Department of Police (including repetition of message) shall not exceed forty-
five seconds duration.
      (2)   The recorded message transmitted shall be repeated not less than
three nor more than four times and shall have an automatic abort feature to
ensure this requirement.
      (3)   The recorded message being transmitted shall incorporate language

message identifying by street number and street name the location of the
emergency and the nature of the event which caused the alarm system to
activate. If the location of the event signaled by the alarm system is in a
multi-family building, the message shall also identify by number and by floor
this particular dwelling unit, office unit, or commercial unit in which the
event occurred.
      (4)   The recorded message being transmitted to the Department shall be
appropriate for the purpose for which the alarm system was installed, and the

user to operate the alarm system properly and to obtain service for the alarm
system at any time.
   (e)   Emergency Alarm Buttons. Emergency alarm buttons are to be used only
to send an automatic alarm to signal an unauthorized entry or a robbery to the
Police Department.
      (1)   The activation of a panic alarm is intended to signal the Police
Department of an emergency situation.

grants to the Police Department the right to conduct any investigation deemed
necessary to investigate and verify the authenticity of the alarm.
         A.   Panic alarm users will execute waivers to be submitted to the
Chief of Police which intent is to allow the Police Department the right to
enter onto the premises of the alarm user to verify the alarm.
         B.   The contents of such waiver is to be specified by the Law
Department of the City.
      (3)   It shall be deemed a violation of this chapter if a panic device is

interconnected to the Police Department shall be exempt from the revocation and
disconnect order sections of this chapter but shall be subject to the
administrative fee assessments as described in Section
707.11 and shall also be subject to the criminal penalties for violation of
this chapter as provided in Section
707.99.
707.17 ORDER TO DISCONNECT.
   (a)   In addition to the administrative fees described in Section
707.11 and in addition to any criminal penalties imposed under Section
707.99, an alarm user who has more than six false alarms in a twelve month
period (calculated as described in Section
707.11) and who is deemed by the Police Department not to have made reasonable
efforts toward correction of the false alarm situation shall be issued an order
to disconnect the alarm system so that signals are not emitted to notify the
Police Department either directly or indirectly.
   A similar order to disconnect shall be issued to any alarm user who has
failed to deliver to the City full payment for any administrative fee levied
under Section
707.11 (for excessive false alarms) within thirty days after written notice of
that fee has been mailed or otherwise delivered to the last known address of
the alarm user or to the address at which the alarm system is located.
   Further, a disconnect order shall be issued to any alarm user who has failed
to obtain a user's permit as required by Section
707.10.
   (b)   The disconnection is to be completed by the alarm user within ten days
after the written disconnect order is mailed or otherwise delivered to the last
known address of the alarm user or to the address at which the alarm system is
located.
   (c)   An alarm user subject to an order to disconnect has the right to
appeal under the procedures set forth below in Section
707.18. Any disconnect order must refer to this right to appeal. If such an
appeal is filed, the disconnection is to be completed within ten days after
similar delivery of notice of the appellate decision, if that decision
sustained the disconnect order.
   (d)   Once disconnected, an alarm system may be reconnected only if so
ordered by the Chief of Police in a decision on an appeal or if a preponderance
of the credible evidence available to the Police Chief indicates:
      (1)   That the alarm system has been repaired so it will not emit further
false alarms; or
      (2)   If the disconnect order was based on failure to pay assessments
when due, that all delinquent false alarm fees have been paid in full; or
      (3)   If the disconnect order has been based upon failure to register or
re-register so as to obtain a permit and keep it in effect as required by
Section
707.10, that registration had been completed so as to obtain an original or
renewal of a user's permit.
707.18 APPEALS FROM FALSE ALARM FEES AND DISCONNECT ORDERS.

fee may appeal the question of whether or not a false alarm has occurred.
      (2)   An alarm user subject to an order to disconnect for failure to make
reasonable efforts toward correction of a false alarm situation may appeal the
determination that such reasonable efforts were not made.
      (3)   An alarm user subject to an order to disconnect for failure to
obtain or renew a user's permit as required by Section
707.10 may appeal the issue of whether or not that user had a permit in effect
for the location in question or was required by this chapter to have such a

sale.

cannot be returned to the seller in substantially as good condition as when
received by the buyer.

order to adequately and properly serve the needs and convenience of the general
public of the City.
      (2)   In the determination as to whether "public convenience and
necessity", as herein defined, shall require the issuance of additional
licenses, Council shall consider the following:
         A.   The resulting effect upon the business of existing holders of
licenses and upon the existing agencies of mass transportation.
         B.   The effect upon traffic congestion and safety on the public
streets.
         C.   The effect upon working conditions and wages or other
compensation paid to drivers of taxicabs or existing holders of licenses.
         D.   Whether persons holding licenses for the operation of taxicabs
are, under normal conditions, adequately serving the public.
         E.   Whether the requirements of "public convenience and necessity"
can be adequately met and complied with by the issuance of additional licenses.
   (c)   "Taxicab" means:
      (1)   Any vehicle operated for compensation which receives passengers at
a place within the City, to be driven to a destination either within or without

conflict with or, in the opinion of the Chief of Police, imitates a color
scheme, monogram, name or insignia used by any other person, firm or
corporation operating a taxicab or taxicabs, in such manner as to be misleading
or tending to deceive or defraud the public. If, after a license has been
issued to a taxicab hereunder, the color scheme, name, monogram or insignia
thereof is changed so as to be in conflict or, in the opinion of the Chief of
Police, imitates any color scheme, monogram, name or insignia used by any other
person, firm or corporation operating a taxicab or taxicabs, in such manner as
to be misleading or attempting to deceive or defraud the public, the license of
that taxicab or taxicabs shall be revoked.

   Each taxicab operated under this chapter shall at all times be kept in a

notice to the operator and an opportunity duly afforded to comply therewith,
shall be grounds for revocation of the operator's license.
(1987 Code 117.11)
735.12 INSPECTION OF TAXICABS.
   The Chief of Police shall, from time to time as he may deem necessary or
convenient, cause to be made an inspection of all licensed taxicabs. If any
taxicab is found unsafe or unfit for the public transportation of passengers or

measured by a City water meter or by a meter acceptable to Council, then in
each case the amount of water so used shall be otherwise measured or determined
by Council in order to determine the sewer service charge or rental provided in
this chapter, or the owner or other interested party, at his expense, may
install and maintain a meter acceptable to Council for such purposes.

measure the wastes by meter, Council shall measure those wastes in a manner and
by any method as it may find practicable in the light of the conditions and
attendant circumstances of the case, in order to determine the sewer service
charge or rental, according to the corresponding rates provided in this
chapter.
   (e)   In any case not clearly defined or capable of being classified in the

portion of a given calendar quarter. Every dwelling unit shall be presumed to
be occupied unless its owner submits a request for written certification of
vacancy at least annually to the City Manager demonstrating that the dwelling
is and will continue to be vacant. The suspension of water service or
comparable circumstances which render a dwelling unit incapable of being
occupied shall be a prima facie demonstration of such vacancy. Submitting a
false request for certification or failing to rescind a prior certification of

established procedures. In the case of two-family or multiple family dwellings,
each unit therein shall be charged the charge mentioned below for those
services.
   (b)   Collection and removal of garbage, rubbish and debris from dwelling
units and buildings used for residential purposes shall be made at least once
each week. Each dwelling unit within the Municipality shall be charged twelve
dollars and sixty cents ($12.60) which is hereby authorized to be enacted for
such residential service payable in advance to the Municipality. Such charge
shall be collected in the same manner as water and sewer charges are collected,
and in an amount as established by a resolution of Council which is hereby
authorized to be enacted.
   (c)   City of Trotwood residents who receive refuse collection from the City
of Trotwood, who have currently paid all of their refuse collection bills and
who are eligible for the State of Ohio Homestead Exemption, may receive a
twenty percent (20%) discount off their refuse collection bill. Residents will
be required to apply for the discount with the City of Trotwood Utilities
Division and provide documentation that they have qualified for and are
receiving the State of Ohio Homstead Exeemption on their property.

929.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purposes of this Stormwater Management Code are as follows:
   (a)    To provide for effective management and financing of a Stormwater
System within the City;
   (b)    To provide a mechanism for mitigating the damaging effects of
uncontrolled and unplanned Stormwater runoff;
   (c)    To improve the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the
safe and efficient capture and conveyance of stormwater runoff and the
correction of Stormwater problems; to authorize the establishment and
implementation of a master plan for Storm drainage, including design,
coordination, construction, management, operation, maintenance, inspection and
enforcement;
   (d)    To establish reasonable Storm drainage service charges based on each
Property's contribution of Stormwater runoff to the system and use and benefit
of services and Facilities; and
   (e)    To encourage and facilitate urban water resources management
techniques, including detention of Stormwater runoff, minimization of the need
to construct Storm Sewers, and the enhancement of the environment.
      (Ord. 35-05. Passed 9-19-05.)
929.02 STORMWATER CHARGE GENERALLY.
   (a)    In order to accomplish such purpose a Storm drainage service charge
shall be made on each lot or parcel in the City.
   (b)    Each Property's contribution to runoff shall be the primary
consideration in setting the service charge. Secondary consideration shall be
given to specific or unusual service requirements of some properties and
special and general benefits accruing to or from properties as a result of
providing their own Stormwater management Facilities.
   (c)    The City's Storm drainage service charges shall be fair and
reasonable and bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing service
and Facilities. All residential properties shall pay the same Stormwater
service charges. Charges for non-residential properties within the City shall
be calculated based on the relationship that the total Impervious Surface (as
defined in Section
 929.03) for such parcel bears to the average Impervious Surface area of
residential homes within the City as defined in Section
929.26. Such service charges shall be adopted by Council through the passage of
a resolution setting the monthly rates.
   (d)    Stormwater costs shall be spread throughout the City, except where
activities or Facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of the normal level
of service City-wide.
   (e)    Charges for single-family residential properties shall reflect the
relatively uniform effect that single-family residential development has on
runoff. Multi-family residential properties having two or more dwelling units
and properties in land uses other than residential shall pay in proportion to
single-family residential properties. The impervious area of other land uses
shall be considered in calculating these rates.
   (f)    An appeal and service charge adjustment process shall be employed to
review Stormwater charges when unusual circumstances exist which alter runoff
characteristics or when either service or benefit varies from a normal
condition or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff.
(Ord. 35-05. Passed 9-19-05.)

subject to the Storm Drainage Service Charge who are also customers of the
City's water system shall, at the City's option, pay the Storm Drainage Service
Charge on a monthly basis in the manner and in accordance with any regulations
established pursuant to Section
929.11 hereof. Any owner of a lot or parcel which is subject to the Storm
Drainage Service Charge who is not a City water customer shall pay the Storm
Drainage Service Charge annually in the manner and according to any regulations
established pursuant to Section
929.11 hereof. The City shall use its best efforts to cause bills for the
service charges to be delivered to each owner or designee on a monthly or
annual basis, as applicable, however, the failure of the City to deliver such a
bill to an owner or his designee shall not be cause for non-payment. The Storm
Drainage Service Charge is a continuous charge for all improved properties
subject to the charge, whether occupied or vacant. The owner of the Property or
Properties is responsible for payment of all service charges whether incurred
under his ownership or previously. Statements may be mailed to another
designated person upon the written agreement of the City and the owner, such as
a tenant or agent; however, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment.
   (b)    Bills are payable on or before the "due date" printed on the bill.
Any amount not paid by the due date shall be considered delinquent and subject
to a "late payment penalty" of five percent (5%) of the current charges. When a
bill or part thereof is delinquent for thirty (30) days, a Notice shall be sent
to the owner advising of the delinquency. If a bill remains delinquent for
sixty (60) days, the City shall certify to the County Auditor all charges for
Stormwater services which are delinquent for payment. Such amounts, including
County collection fees shall be entered upon the tax duplicate of the Property
involved and shall be a lien upon such land from and after the date of the
entry, to be collected with other taxes and returned to the City.

adjustment or review thereof, stating in writing the grounds of the complaint.
The City Manager or the City Manager's designee shall consider the complaint
and determine whether an adjustment of the charges for any such lot or parcel
is necessary to provide for the just and equitable application of the Storm
drainage service charge, and adjust such charge if appropriate, or determine
whether a complaint regarding the denial of a permit or any condition placed on
a permit approval is appropriate or should be modified.

   (b)    Location.
      (1)    In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of the
Right of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater. The City of Trotwood also finds that certain locations
and collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and
collocation configuration shall be utilized whenever possible and should only
be surpassed if in the determination of the City Engineer or designee, clear
and convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be
grounds for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.    First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.    Second small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.    Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         D.    Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         E.    Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         F.    Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         G.    Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right of Way.
      (2)    Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 1230
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)    Public utilities, cable operators, and operators shall comply with
the undergrounding requirements set forth by the City Engineer.
   (c)    Wireless Facilities Design.

      (3)    Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards, unless such standards conflict with the Design Standards set
forth by the City Engineer as set forth above. In the event there is a
conflict, the Design Standards set forth by the City Engineer shall control:
         A.    New wireless support structures shall be limited to forty feet
in height, unless, (i) the area is within three hundred feet of the proposed
site for a new wireless support structure in the same public way or a
connecting public way, and there are no wireless support structure or utility
poles taller than thirty feet in height above ground level; or (ii) the maximum
allowable height for building construction in the underlying zoning district is
thirty-five feet in height above ground level or less. If (i) or (ii) of this
section apply, then new wireless support structure shall be limited to thirty-
five feet in height;
         B.    Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators;
         C.    As determined by the City Engineer or designee, wireless support
structures design shall be consistent with the design features of nearby poles,
including but not limited to consistent style, material, color, and the design
features of the existing or proposed streetscape, district, or site and in
furtherance of the maintaining the historical context of a district or specific
site understanding that in some instances, there is a desire to camouflage or
conceal the pole from view.
      (4)    Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.    The City reserves the right to require the following:
            1.    Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to
the extent deemed necessary by the City Engineer or designee in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
               i.    Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The City
Engineer or designee may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial
fitting if, in the City Engineer or designee’s discretion, the side-mounted
antenna would be a better match to the aesthetics and character of the
immediate area and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
               ii.    GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.    Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
         C.    All portions of a Small Cell Facility other than an antenna and
as identified by the ORC 4939.01 (P)2, shall not exceed twenty-eight cubic feet
in volume per facility.
         D.    Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small sell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:

or twenty inches in depth;
            3.    Not extend more than twenty-four inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
            4.    Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which
it is mounted;
            5.    Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure; and
            6.    Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane’s direction of travel.
         E.    Such common enclosures shall have the following design elements:
            1.    Material – The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the City Engineer or
designee.
            2.    Color – The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            3.    Style – The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            4.    Coordinated Design Elements – Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
               i.    Such enclosures are located within 5000 feet of an
existing common enclosure; and
               ii.    Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support
structures of a similar or matching design.
            5.    Exception – If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area would be better matched by an enclosure a different material, color,
style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the City Engineer or designee, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be based
on the following factors:
               i.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               ii.    The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               iii.    The historical context of a district or specific site;
and
               iv.    A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from
view.

vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the City Engineer or designee:
            1.    The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the City Engineer or designee shall
reserve the right to require any of the following conditions:
               i.    Concealed Enclosure – All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the City Engineer or designee.

1105.01 NECESSITY OF URBAN RENEWAL.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City slum,
blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this
chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimicable
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents
thereof; that the existence of such areas:
   (a)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community;
retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems,
and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities; and that this menace is beyond remedy and
control solely by regulatory processes and exercise of the police power, and
cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operation of private
enterprise without the aids herein provided; that the elimination in whole or
in part of slum, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas, and the
conservation, rehabilitation and reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of the
salvageable portions thereof by urban renewal as defined herein, are public
uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and private property
acquired by purchase, by donation and by eminent domain and are governmental
functions of concern to the City, and require the exercise of the powers of
government granted to the City by the provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio
Constitution and that the necessity in the public interest and general welfare,
for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of
legislative determination.
   (b)   Constitutes an economic and social liability; and
   (c)   Substantially increases the risk of the spread of disease, economic
decay and crime; and of losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive
and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection and for other public services and
facilities.

person charged with the preparation and custody of the record of proceedings of
the Planning Commission.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval of or recommendations concerning such plan or plans. The approval of
the Commission shall also constitute its approval of those matters placed under
its jurisdiction by Ohio R.C. 713.02, or the Charter and ordinances of the City
of Trotwood except as the recommendations of the Planning Commission may
include a disapproval pursuant to such laws. Except as recommendations or
disapprovals are received from the Planning Commission within thirty-one days
after its receipt of such plan or plans, the plan or plans shall be
conclusively presumed to have been approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 6-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1105.07 PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)   Council shall either approve or reject the urban renewal plan or make
modifications in accordance with the recommendations of the City Planning
Commission. The legislative approval by Council of the general neighborhood
renewal plan should contain a finding that it conforms to the general plan of
the City and such findings as may be necessary or desirable, but need not
contain the other findings set forth in subsection (c) hereof for urban renewal
plans and such other findings as may be necessary or desirable. Such approval
may be made before or at the same time as the approval of an urban renewal plan
for a project within the general neighborhood renewal plan.
   Before approving or modifying an urban renewal plan, Council shall hold a
public hearing at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons
interested to be heard, either in person or by counsel, which hearing may be
adjourned from time to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a
week for two consecutive weeks, and at least fifteen full days shall elapse
between the second publication and the date set for the public hearing. In
addition, notice shall be sent thirty days before the hearing by ordinary
first-class mail to the owners shown on the records of the Auditor of
Montgomery County, Ohio for each parcel within the urban renewal district and
by first-class mail to any occupant listed in the Williams Directory for any
address contained in the urban renewal district. Such notices shall also
contain a description of each project area by its location in relation to
highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or artificial boundaries, and
shall also designate the place at which the Plan, together with maps, plats or
other materials describing the project area are and will be available for
public inspection.
   (b)   If as a result of the public hearing, Council desires to modify the
urban renewal plan other than in accordance with such plan approved by or in
accordance with the recommendations of the City Planning Commission, the
modified urban renewal plan shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for
its written approval or recommendations within thirty-one days with the
presumption of approval thereafter, all in accordance with Section
1105.06.
   (c)   If Council wishes to approve an urban renewal plan, it shall do so by
an ordinance passed by majority vote in the manner prescribed by the City’s
Charter and the applicable laws of the State of Ohio, provided, however, that
such plan or plans, as submitted with such ordinance have not been approved by
the Planning Commission, or if there were any partial disapprovals by or
adverse recommendations of the Planning Commission, not accepted by Council by
its modifications of the Planning Commission therewith, then an affirmative
vote of two-thirds of the members of Council shall be required to pass such
ordinance.
   The ordinance of Council approving the plan shall be accompanied by, or
incorporated by reference, documents submitted to Council to support findings
made therein and the ordinance shall include the following findings:
      (1)   Specific findings of fact as to the character of the project area
and that such area is a slum, blighted area, deteriorated or deteriorating
area;
      (2)   That the size of the area and the location of elements of blight
and deterioration in the area make it suitable for urban renewal activities;
      (3)   That there is a feasible method for the temporary relocation of the
families displaced from the project area and that there are being provided in
the project area, or in other areas not generally less desirable in regard to
public utilities and public and commercial facilities at rents and prices
within the financial means of the families displaced from the project area, or
in other areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and
public and commercial facilities at rents and prices within the financial means
of the families displaced from the project area, decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings equal in number to the number of and available to such displaced
families; and reasonably accessible to their places of employment;
      (4)   (This finding is made only if Federal aid is needed.) That
financial aid to be provided by the Federal government under its contract is
necessary to enable the project to be undertaken in accordance with the plan;
      (5)   That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the locality as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise;
      (6)   That the plan is feasible and conforms to the existing general or
master plan for the overall development of the City as prepared by the Planning
Commission;
      (7)   That the plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities, as may be desirable for
neighborhood improvement with special consideration for the health, safety and
welfare of children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by the
plan;
      (8)   (This finding is to be made only if the project area is not
predominantly residential in character and is not to be redeveloped for
predominantly residential uses.) That the redevelopment of the project area for
predominantly nonresidential uses is necessary for the proper development of
the community;
      (9)   That the urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound need of the community as a whole for the
redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise.
      (10)   (This finding is to be made only where an open-space land program
is involved.) That the land and the interests in land to be acquired are for
the purpose of preserving such area as open space land and are necessary to
orderly long-range development, to curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban
blight and deterioration, to encourage more economical and desirable urban
development and to provide areas for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation
areas, watersheds, and to preserve natural resources, and that the area so to
be acquired is of a size and character appropriate for such purposes.
      (11)   (This finding is to be made only where an educational institution
or a hospital is located in or near the project area and it is desired to
utilize Section 112 of the Housing Act of 1949; as amended.) That, in addition
to the elimination of slums and blight from such area, the undertaking of an
urban renewal project in such area will further promote the public welfare and
the proper development of the community:
         A.   By making land in such area available for disposition, for uses
in accordance with the urban renewal plan, to such educational institution or
hospital for redevelopment in accordance with the use or uses specified in the
urban renewal plan;
         B.   By providing, through the redevelopment of the area in accordance
with the urban renewal plan, a cohesive neighborhood environment compatible
with the functions and needs of such educational institution or hospital; or
         C.   By any combination of the foregoing.
         D.   The approval by Council of the plan shall constitute authority to
spend moneys of the City appropriated for such purpose and the proceeds of
bonds or notes issued for such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts,
donations and grants from the Federal government, the State of Ohio, any
entity, instrumentality or subdivision of either, or from any other entity or
person;
         E.   The Clerk of Council shall certify as true and correct and
deliver to the City Manager a copy of the aforesaid ordinance of Council
approving the plan for his approval or veto, and appropriate further action.
            (Ord. 6-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1105.08 FEDERAL CONTRACTS.
   Any contract with a Federal agency for loans, advances, grants or other
Federal aid to the City shall be approved by the Law Director as to form and
legality and after approval and authorization by ordinance of Council, passed
in accordance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 731.17 and the Charter and
Ordinances of the City of Trotwood, shall be executed by the City Manager.
(Ord. 6-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1105.09 MODIFICATION OF URBAN RENEWAL PLAN.
   An urban renewal plan and the ordinance approving it may be amended,
modified or changed by ordinance of Council from time to time, before or after
its initial approval thereof; provided, that, if the boundaries of the project
area are extended to include any parcels of land not previously included
therein or if there is added a new type of urban renewal activity which
requires the acquisition of property or if there is a change in the proposed
zoning within the project area or in any other matter directly within the
jurisdiction of the Planning Commission to approve or disapprove, all of the
proceedings provided for in Sections
1105.06 and
1105.07 shall be carried out in connection with such amendment, modification or

(Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1113.04 STREETS.
   All streets proposed to be constructed within a new subdivision shall be
designed in the following manner:
   (a)   Grades of proposed streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography.
   (b)   Wherever possible a proposed street shall be arranged such that
adjacent building sites are at, or above, the grades of the street.
   (c)   Subdivisions which adjoin or include existing streets which do not
conform to required street widths shall be required to dedicate additional
right-of-way along either or both sides of such street, and shall construct
improvements as are necessary to bring the street or streets up to the
standards specified in this chapter.
   (d)   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted.
   (e)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as a part of a continuing street plan, only if
a temporary turnaround satisfactory in design to the Planning Commission is
provided, and provisions for maintenance and removal are approved.
   (f)   Multiple intersections involving the junctions of more than two
streets shall be avoided.
   (g)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly at right angles
as possible.
   (h)   T-intersections shall be encouraged whenever a proposed street is to
intersect with a collector or arterial street.
   (i)   In order to further the sense of neighborhood, the development of
greater numbers of loop and cul-de-sac streets shall be encouraged. In
addition, grid street systems shall be encouraged where no direct connection
with major arterials will occur.
   (j)   The distance between the centerline of offset street intersections
shall not be less than 150 feet.
   (k)   The platting of double frontage residential lots whose rear yards face
or directly abut upon a street shall be discouraged.
      (1)   Where double frontage lots are permitted to be established by the
Planning Commission, a developer shall be required to plant a buffer area
measuring a minimum of thirty feet in width between the rear property line of
adjoining parcels and the edge of the future right-of-way. In those instances,
provision shall be made for the construction of an approved decorative stone or
brick wall measuring a minimum of four feet in height and placed so as to be
immediately adjacent to the lot lines, and the placement of approved landscape
materials between the wall and the edge of the future right-of-way.
      (2)   Whenever the Planning Commission has determined that such a
combination of wall and landscape materials is not necessary, it shall require
a developer to provide earth berming and an approved planting of dense
evergreen trees between all rear lot lines and the edge of the future right-of-
way. All such trees shall measure a minimum in-ground height of not less than
eight feet and shall be spaced so as to measure a minimum distance of not more
than twenty feet on center. In addition, a minimum distance of thirty (30) feet
shall be maintained between the center of a tree and the corner of a street
intersection, while a minimum distance of fifteen feet shall be required
between the center of a tree and any fire hydrants.
      (3)   Under no circumstances shall a required buffer area be dedicated to
the City, nor shall that area be maintained by City personnel. In those
instances, title shall remain with either the developer, a homeowner's
association or other responsible party. In addition, all maintenance shall be
the responsibility of the property owner.
   (l)   Except where waivers may be approved by the Planning Commission, or
unless otherwise provided in these Subdivision Regulations, all new streets
shall be graded and improved with pavement, sidewalks, driveway approaches,
curbs, gutters, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, fire hydrants and
necessary appurtenance.
   (m)   Where required, a marginal access street (service road) shall contain
a minimum pavement width of twenty (20) feet and shall consist of a minimum
right-of-way width of fifty feet.
   (n)   An approved cul-de-sac shall not be permitted to exceed 800 feet in
length, and shall be required to have a minimum curb radius, for the vehicular
turnaround, of forty feet.
   (o)   All proposed streets shall be built according to the standards
contained in Table 1 below.

requirement where the improvement would either not be compatible with a
surrounding or adjacent neighborhood, or would not serve the best interests of
the general public.
      (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1113.06 BOULEVARDS.
   The Planning Commission may reserve the right to require the dedication of a
landscaped boulevard median in place of additional right-of-way paving which
would otherwise be used for on-street parking purposes, whenever the provision
of a boulevard is required, the following dimensions shall apply:
   (a)   Two traffic lanes with a minimum width of fourteen feet each. (No on-
street parking shall be permitted.)
   (b)   A fourteen-foot wide landscaped median.

Planning Commission shall reserve the right, in certain instances, to require
that such a distance be increased to a maximum of 100 feet.
   (d)   The minimum distance permitted between curb cuts on adjoining
nonresidential lots shall be not less than 100 feet unless otherwise authorized
by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   No residential commercial or industrial use shall be permitted to
create a continuous curb cut or driveway along its property line.
   (f)   Where a marginal access street (service road) is proposed, the minimum

previously been identified in the City's Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1113.12 STREET NAMING.
   For the purposes of street naming, the following suffixes shall be used:
   (a)   Avenue shall be used only for streets that run in a generally east-
west direction.
   (b)   Boulevard or drive shall be used only for a large meandering type
street.
   (c)   Circle or court shall be used only for cul-de-sac type streets that
run in a generally east-west direction.
   (d)   Lane or place shall be used only for cul-de-sac type streets that run
in a generally north-south direction.
   (e)   Road or way shall be used only for streets that run in a diagonal
manner.
   (f)   Street shall be used only for thoroughfares that run in a generally
north-south direction.
   (g)   The words north, south, east or west should be avoided as part of a
street name whenever possible.
   (h)   Whenever a new street is constructed along the approximate alignment
or extension of an existing street, its name shall be the same as that of the
existing one.
   (i)   Whenever a cul-de-sac serves not more than three lots, the name of the
intersecting street shall apply to the cul-de-sac.
   (j)   The proposed names of all streets shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission.
      (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1113.13 LARGE PRIVATE PARKING LOTS.
   Where a parking lot is proposed to consist of fifty or more spaces, it shall
include, as a minimum, one decorative or ornamental tree for every ten parking
spaces to be provided. These plantings may be placed either within the required
setback area or the interior parking lot area, or both. Whenever 100 or more
parking spaces will be provided, at least one-half of the required number of
trees shall be placed within the interior of the parking lot. Regardless of
parking lot size, the number of trees required may be planted in clusters, or
may be planted in evenly spaced or staggered rows.
(Ord. 2-99. Passed 1-19-99.)
1113.14 STREET AND BUILDING ORIENTATION.
   Whenever a new residential construction is proposed, the Planning Commission
shall, in an effort to maximize energy savings, give priority to the approval
of those plats where maximum use of east-west streets, as opposed to north-
south streets, will occur. Wherever possible, residential structures should be
built with their roof lines running east and west in order to permit maximum
sun exposure on the south side of the dwelling unit. This orientation will
ensure that generous amounts of sunlight will enter the dwelling during winter,
bringing added warmth and reducing the amount of fuel needed for indoor
comfort. For the same reason, glass areas should be minimized on the north,
east and especially west sides of all new residential dwellings. Further,
greater energy savings can be gained by encouraging the incorporation of roof
overhangs into residential building design.

1115.15 TREE COVER AND STREET TREES.
   The following regulations shall govern the retention of existing trees:
   (a)   All trees having a circumference (as measured four and one-half feet
from the ground) of twenty-four or more inches shall, unless otherwise
authorized by the Planning Commission, be preserved whenever a proposed
subdivision has been submitted for approval. The Planning Commission shall have
the authority, on a case by case basis, to require the preservation of trees
with a smaller diameter where necessary.
   (b)   In order to better protect trees and their respective root systems
from possible damage during the construction of a subdivision, no blacktop or
concrete shall be poured, within five (5) feet of the base of all trees having
a circumference of less than thirty-six inches. Similarly, no blacktop or
concrete shall be poured within four (4) feet of the base of all trees having a
circumference of between thirty-six and fifty-nine inches; ten (10) feet of the
base of all trees having a circumference of between sixty and eighty-three
inches; and fifteen (15) feet of the base of all trees having a circumference
of eighty-four inches or more. In addition, wooden staking or brick barriers
shall completely surround such a preservation zone in order to further protect
against potential harm from construction equipment. Further, no fill dirt shall
be permitted to be placed within such a preservation zone in order to help
prevent possible root damage. Furthermore, to protect an existing tree on a
construction site, the grade should not be altered higher or lower than six
inches (6") from the existing grade within the dripline of the tree. The
dripline is the area on the ground plane that relates to the full circumference
of the tree’s canopy. While minimum distances for disturbance and paving have
been established above, to provide the best protection for a tree to survive,
no construction should occur within the dripline of the tree.
   (c)   Unless authorized by the Planning Commission, no construction
equipment shall, during the earth-moving process, be permitted to interfere
with the integrity of a tree's branching system.
   (d)   Street trees, as used herein, shall mean those deciduous or coniferous
trees which are planted within a public right-of-way, or on easements
immediately adjacent to public right-of-ways. The planting of those trees shall
be undertaken in all residential zoning districts in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   At least two street trees shall be required to be planted for each
one- or two- family lot for which a zoning permit has been issued.
      (2)   At least one street tree shall be required to be planted for each
fifty linear feet of lot frontage for which a zoning permit has been issued
within a four-family or multi-family residential zoning district.
      (3)   Whenever on-site street trees have been specifically delineated for
preservation in the same manner or proportion as stated in subsection
1115.15(d)(l) or (2) hereof, the street tree planting requirement may be
modified by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Street tree plantings shall be restricted in those locations where
damage to underground or aerial utilities may occur, or where a conflict with
driveways, sidewalks, walkways/bikeways, curbs and gutters, water mains and
sewer facilities is likely. Further, in order to prevent interference with
motorists' or pedestrians' site distances, no street tree shall be permitted to
be planted within thirty feet of intersecting rights of way.
      (5)   Whenever the Planning Commission has determined that sidewalks will
not be required within a residential zoning district, all street trees shall be
planted eight (8) feet back from the edge of the street curb.
      (6)   All street tree plantings shall be inspected by the City Engineer

subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall issue zoning and occupancy
certificates, notwithstanding minor failures to comply with the literal terms
of this chapter, where he/she finds the existence of all of the following:
         A.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee, or
occupant as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of this
chapter were literally enforced.
         B.   That the requested modification is not based exclusively upon a
desire of the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to realize economic gain.
         C.   That the issuing of a certificate will not be materially
detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood
in which the subject property is located.
         D.   That the proposed deviation will not impair an adequate supply of
light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (2)   General categories. The duty of the Zoning Administrator to issue
zoning and occupancy certificates notwithstanding minor failure to comply with
the zoning code shall extend to the following general categories:
         A.   Yards.
         B.   Maximum lot coverage.
         C.   Lot area.

in this section where it appears that:
         A.   With respect to failures to comply with the appropriate yard
requirements that:
            1.   Proposed structures will encroach into required yards a
distance not greater than 25% of the width or depth of such required yard, or
            2.   Proposed extensions of lawfully existing structures which are
already located within required yards where the pattern of development was
established prior to this chapter, will not encroach any further into such
required yard, and will not be enlarged or extended in excess of 25%, or
            3.   Proposed extensions of unenclosed covered porches and patios
will encroach into required distance not greater than 25% of the width or depth
of such yard, or
            4.   Where proposed structures are to be located between existing
structures, a front yard depth can be established not less than the average
depth of the front yards of buildings adjoining on either side.
         B.   With respect to lot coverage requirements that the proposed
deviation will not vary more than 10% from the permitted lot coverage
requirement.
         C.   With respect to off-street parking requirements the following may
apply:
            1.   For any change of permitted use in a densely developed
business or industrial district where no reasonable alternative exists for
providing the parking spaces required of the new use; the small number of
spaces provided by the previous use may be permitted provided the intensity of
the new use is not greater than the previous use.
            2.   For all other parking requirements the proposed deviation
shall not vary more than (2) spaces or 30% of the required number of spaces,
whichever is greater.
         D.   With respect to setback requirements, that:
            1.   A street widening is not scheduled within the next five (5)
years, or
            2.   A recent street improvement has been made in the immediate
vicinity which suggests additional street improvements may be a number of years
away, or
            3.   Any future street improvement requirements can be accomplished
within the existing right-of-way, or
            4.   Adjacent structures of substantial investment are in place
thereby making it unlikely that future widenings would take place, or
            5.   Structural improvements are of a minor investment and the
owner agrees to sign a waiver requiring him to remove the improvements at the
owner’s expense in the event the City does not make Thoroughfare
improvements.   
         E.   With respect to lot area requirement for either new construction
or conversion, that:
            1.   For single-family and multi-family uses, the proposed
deviation is no more than 10% of the required lot area.
            2.   For two-family and multi-family use, the proposed deviation is
no more than 10% of the required lot area.
      (4)   Conditions established by the Zoning Administrator.  In the event
the Zoning Administrator issues a zoning and occupancy certificate pursuant to
this section, he shall impose such conditions or requirements as are necessary

subject to this subsection. The Zoning Administrator may consider factors that
include, but are not limited to, the nature or size of the proposal, changes in
the development or traffic patterns of the area, or newly discovered evidence
pertinent to a decision on a previous application.
      (2)   Any decision made by the Zoning Administrator with respect to the
preceding paragraph may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to
Section
1127.02 of this Zoning Ordinance. Any appeal taken must be submitted in writing
and received by the Zoning Administrator within fifteen days of the Zoning
Administrator's decision.
   (c)   Board of Zoning Appeals Review. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall base
its review of a variance application upon the complete application, any staff
report, and upon any relevant and credible public testimony and evidence
presented during the adjudicatory hearing. If the Board of Zoning Appeals finds
that the information presented at hearing is insufficient to make a
determination, it may suspend its review until sufficient information has been
provided.
      (1)   Burden of proof. The applicant is required to present proof, by a
preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial testimony and evidence,
that the property owner will suffer practical difficulties in the use of the
property if the variance is not granted.
      (2)   Decision standards. The Board of Zoning Appeals will consider the
variance request while also considering the public health, safety, and welfare
of the community. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that
practical difficulties exist with respect to the property in question that
would render the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance unreasonable. The
Board of Zoning Appeals may only consider evidence and testimony presented at
hearing, and it shall not consider other variances granted in the community,
unless an applicant specifically introduces evidence and testimony regarding
other variances granted in the same zoning district. In the event an applicant
intends to introduce evidence at hearing as to other variances granted in the
same zoning district, the applicant must provide the Zoning Administrator with
notice of his intent to introduce such evidence at least seven days prior to
the scheduled hearing. In determining whether practical difficulties exist that
are sufficient to warrant a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider and weigh the following factors
         A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         B.   Whether the requested variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered, or whether adjoining property owners would suffer a
substantial detriment if the variance were granted;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e., water, sewer, garbage, fire rescue, and the like);
         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament can feasibly be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirements
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance; and
         H.   Any other relevant factor.
   (d)    Action by Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   Prior to taking action on a request for a variance, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing within forty-five days of receipt of
a fully complete variance application, unless the time for the hearing is
extended by agreement of the applicant and the City, Notice of the public
hearing will be published as required by law, and notice of the scheduled
hearing shall also be provided by the City to all property owners within 300
feet of the property, by ordinary mail, at least ten days prior to the
scheduled hearing.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant, grant with conditions, or
deny a variance application as presented, and it shall clearly state the
findings upon which its decision is based on the record. The Zoning
Administrator, or the Zoning Administrator's designee, shall prepare and issue
a written notification to the applicant memorializing the Board of Zoning
Appeals' decision and the findings upon which the Board of Zoning Appeals
decision is based.
      (3)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its decision only upon the
decision standards set forth in this chapter. No one decision standard set
forth in subsection (c)(2) above is controlling, and the Board of Zoning
Appeals is not required to weigh each factor set forth above equally.
      (4)   When making its determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
waive or modify the dimensional regulations prescribed by the Zoning Ordinance,
or it may impose more strict regulations and any additional conditions,
guarantees, and safeguards as it deems appropriate to satisfy the purposes and
intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Issuance of Permits.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall issue permits authorizing the action
for which the variance was sought if the requested variance is granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. Construction permits shall not be issued unless the
plans substantially conform to those upon which a variance was granted. Any
action that exceeds a granted variance shall constitute a violation of the
Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   No order of the Board of Zoning Appeals that grants a variance
which, as a result, permits the erection or alteration of a building, shall be
valid for a period of more than one year, unless all requisite permits for the
construction or reconstruction of the building have been obtained and the work
at the site has commenced. The one-year validity period may be extended by the
Zoning Administrator, at the Zoning Administrator's discretion, if the
applicant makes a written request for an extension of time to the Zoning
Administrator before the expiration of the one-year term. If the Zoning
Administrator denies the request for an extension of time, the Zoning
Administrator's decision may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals
pursuant to Section
1127.02. Any appeal taken must be submitted in writing to the Zoning
Administrator within fifteen days of the Zoning Administrator's decision.
   (f)   Effect of Variance. Upon approval of a variance application by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, unless the approval expires pursuant to subsection (e)
(2) above, the variance shall continue to apply to the property, even if the
property is subsequently transferred to a new owner.

Nonconforming Uses
1131.01    Purpose.
1131.02    Regulation of nonconformities.
 
CROSS REFERENCES
Nonconforming uses - see Ohio R.C. 713.15
 
 
1131.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to control, reduce and/or eliminate conflicts
arising from the presence in any district of uses or structures which do not
currently conform to applicable district regulations.
(Ord. 1-99. Passed 1-19-99.)
1131.02 REGULATION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (a)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun or for which a zoning
permit was approved prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   A nonconforming use of a building or structure lawfully existing upon
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be permitted to be maintained
and repaired.
   (c)   A nonconforming use or structure shall not be enlarged, extended or
moved, except that a nonconforming structure may be reconstructed in such a
manner as to make it conforming.
   (d)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (e)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months,
such a use shall not thereafter be reestablished except in conformance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (f)   A nonconforming structure which is damaged by fire, flood or act of
God to an extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its value, as determined by
the County Assessor, shall not be restored or reconstructed except in such a
manner and for such a use as will conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   (g)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record existing at the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
This provision shall apply even though such a lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or lot frontage, or both, that are applicable in the
zoning district where such a lot is located, provided that requirements other
than those applying to area or lot frontage, or both, shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such a lot is located.
   (h)   No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use
without the written authorization of the Board of Zoning Appeals, except that
where a substitution is proposed, no structural alterations or improvements
shall be permitted to be made.
   (i)   Residential properties which are determined by this Code to be
nonconforming uses may be granted an exception to these requirements upon
application to and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals. In making its
determination the Board shall consider:
      (1)   Whether similarly situated properties exist within proximity to the
subject property.
      (2)   Recent patterns of development and usage of properties in the
vicinity.
      (3)   The possibility that potential conforming development and use is
not likely to occur in the future.
      (4)   The impact such approval might have upon conforming properties in
the vicinity.
         (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
CHAPTER 1133
Conditional Uses
1133.01    Purpose.
1133.02    Authorization to grant a conditional use permit.
1133.03   General standards and considerations.
1133.04   Special standards and considerations.
 
 
1133.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the proper integration of uses
which, because of their special nature, may be suitable only in certain
locations and only provided such uses are arranged or operated in a particular
manner.
(Ord. 02-19. Passed 3-4-19.)
1133.02 AUTHORIZATION TO GRANT A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall be responsible for determining the
merits of an application for a conditional use permit. In doing so, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may approve, conditionally approve or deny such an
application.
   (b)    The Zoning Administrator shall make a thorough investigation and
analysis of an application for a conditional use permit, and shall afterwards
prepare a written report, along with recommendations for submission to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Within forty-five days of the receipt of an application for a
conditional use permit, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing. In addition, the Board shall provide a notice of public hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation in Trotwood not less than ten days prior to
the date of such hearing, and, shall be responsible for notifying by mail, at
least ten (10) days in advance of such hearing, all property owners within 300
feet of the premises in question.
   (d)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve or conditionally approve a
conditional use permit only when it has determined that the proposed use will
not constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the public welfare of the
community.
   (e)    Upon failure to comply with the conditions imposed by Board of Zoning
Appeals or Council, a certified letter shall be sent to the permittee informing
him that he has thirty calendar days from the date the letter is received to
comply with the provisions and conditions of the conditional use permit. If,
after this period of time, the violation(s) has not been remedied, the
conditional use permit shall be revoked.
   (f)    The applicant for a Conditional Use Permit shall be the owner of the
property. In the alternative, the applicant shall submit a signed, notarized
statement from the property owner authorizing the applicant to submit such
application and agreeing to be bound by any conditions imposed by the Board of
Zoning Appeals in conjunction with the approval of the application.
   (g)   Upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit application by the Board of
Zoning Appeals the Permit applies only to the applicant and property owner and
is limited to the term of the applicant’s ownership of the
premises.  Conditional Use Permit approval conditions are a contract between
the City and the applicant. Upon termination of the use or upon change of
ownership the Conditional Use Permit shall be considered revoked and the use
may not be continued or resumed without prior approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
    (h)    Period of validity. A conditional use permit shall expire one year
after it is issued unless actual construction has taken place or is underway or
actual occupancy has occurred, except as provided elsewhere in this Zoning
Code. If a conditional use is approved, the plan must be followed. Any
deviation requires the resubmission of an application for approval of the
conditional use.
(Ord. 02-19. Passed 3-4-19.)
1133.03 GENERAL STANDARDS AND CONSIDERATIONS.
   In reviewing an application for a conditional use permit, the responsible

1140.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT .
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District provisions is
to provide a means of development that is flexible and innovative when
development of a site by standard, more rigid, conventional zoning district
regulations may produce less efficient use of the land and less amenities and
benefits for the community and users of the development. Development under
Planned Unit Development provides a means for encouraging ingenuity,
imagination and flexibility on the part of land owners, engineers, architects,
site planners and developers in the planning and design of land areas.
(Ord. 12-19. Passed 7-1-19.)
1140.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Project Control and Ownership.   Planned unit development district
designation is intended to apply to development sites that are under single
ownership or unified control and to any comprehensive design, planning and
development of the site. The project land may be owned, leased, or controlled
by either one or more persons, partnerships, corporations or other appropriate
business associations capable of satisfying the objectives and requirements of
the planned unit development district. The city may require proof of ownership,
covenants, easements, and other forms of property rights or control to ensure
satisfactory compliance with PUD objectives and requirements.
   (b)   PUD Agreement. Upon approval of Final Development plan, the city, at
its sole discretion, may require the PUD developer to enter into a PUD
agreement with the city, and to furnish a performance bond for the purposes of
assuring satisfaction of completion requirements for improvements such as
landscaping and drainage control facilities and any conditions and safeguards
as may be set by the City Council and the adopted ordinance approving the
specific PUD development. At its discretion, the city may accept a letter of
credit or other form of performance guarantee and security in lieu of a
performance bond. In all cases the sufficiency and adequacy of such bond,
letter of credit or other form of guarantee or security shall be at the sole
determination of the City.
   (c)   Utility Requirements.  All initial and all future expanded utility
systems within the limits of all planned unit development districts are
required to be placed underground. Utility systems subject to this requirement
shall be those that primarily serve the development within the PUD district and
shall include, but not be limited to telephone, cable television, and
electrical systems. Appurtenances of these systems which can be effectively
screened may be excluded from this requirement if the Planning Commission
determines that such appurtenances are essential for utility service to other
areas of the community and that such exclusion will not violate the intent or
character of the proposed planned unit development or any conditions,
restrictions or other requirements imposed upon the development.
   (d)   Site Arrangement Requirements.  The buildings, circulation, open
space, landscaping and other elements of the proposed PUD development shall be
arranged, planned and designed on the site to produce:
(1)   Favorable relationships with the existing natural topography, bodies of
water or water courses, existing desirable vegetation, exposure to significant
views and exposure to sunlight and wind;
(2)   Safety, convenience and ease of pedestrian and vehicular movement on,
about and throughout the site and between the site and the community;
(3)   An overall positive visual quality throughout, into and from the
development site;
(4)   An efficient, functionally organized, and cohesive development; and
(5)   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvements or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner.
(6)   Landscaping and screening shall be as specified in Chapter
1175.
   (e)   PUD Regulations.   The regulations and provisions of this Zoning Code
pertaining to Planned Unit Developments, Chapter
1140.01 through
1140.11 have been substantially revised. All PUD approvals, including any
approved modifications, amendments or conditions, approved by the city prior to
the effective date of this Ordinance and where any time limitation for such
approvals has not expired, shall be governed by the planned unit development
provisions and regulations in effect immediately prior to the adoption of this
Ordinance. If any time limitation attached to an approval of a PUD
modification, amendment or condition has expired, then such approval shall be
governed by the current provisions and regulations of Sections
1140.01 through
1140.20 and this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Appeal of Zoning Administrator Determination.  In order to assure that
Planning Commission and City Council have all information pertinent to the

has been given the responsibility to require additional information as
necessary in order for Planning Commission and City Council to make an informed
decision. Any applicant who objects to the provision of additional information
may request a determination by Planning Commission at its next regularly
scheduled meeting. No further action shall take place regarding the application

1140.18 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)    Purpose. This District is intended to provide flexibility in the
arrangement and design of residential dwellings, based upon a unified
development plan conceived and carried out for the entire PUD tract. Within
this District, appropriate and reasonable population density is maintained
while a variety of dwelling unit types is permitted. Developers are encouraged
to retain, to the degree possible, natural features such as topography, trees,
and drainageways. Such developments are generally characterized by a
significant proportion of usable open space, a unified design concept with
particular attention devoted to the periphery of the development, with the
objective of compatibility of the development with its surroundings
   (b)    Coverage. For developments in residential underlying zoning
districts, the coverage of the total gross area of the development shall not
exceed 45%. For the purposes of this section, coverage shall be interpreted to
include the area covered by all buildings, all parking areas, all driveways,
and all public and private streets and paved rights-of way. Structures and
other impervious surfaces included within, and developed as an integral part of
an area of open space may, at the sole discretion of the Planning Commission
and City Council, be excluded from the coverage of the total gross area
percentage. Developers of PUD are encouraged to achieve an approximate equal
distribution of coverage for each individual phase or subarea of the total PUD.
   (c)    Land Use Density. The overall gross density of shall not exceed
fifteen dwelling units per acre. The Planning Commission may recommend and the
City Council may impose a maximum overall gross density of less than 15 units
per acre. In this section gross density shall be interpreted to mean the
measure of residential land use intensity, calculated by dividing the total
number of dwelling units proposed for the site by the total acreage of the
site. (Example: forty-three total dwelling units divided by ten acres
= 4.3 dwelling units per acre)
   (d)    Building Height. No building shall be erected in excess of forty feet
in height, except, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, the maximum
height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve site design
and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not obscure light and air
sources to immediately surrounding structures, and satisfies applicable fire
and safety regulations.
   (e)    Requirements for Accessory Parking, Loading and Unloading Areas.
Accessory parking and loading and unloading areas shall meet the requirements
of Chapter
1181 Off-Street Parking and Loading. Upon approval of the Planning Commission,
any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
increase benefits to the community that are derived from the development, will
improve site design, will not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and
public facilities, and the purpose of such modification is not to circumvent
the intent of the respective section.

U.S. 49 (Trotwood Connector) shall provide noise barriers consisting of an
earthen mound, solid masonry walls, permanent engineered sound barriers, or
other similarly effective methods or materials along the entire length of the
right- of-way abutting the project. The height of the barrier shall protect all
residential structures to a point at least ten feet above ground level.
      (2)    If any habitable area of the residential structures would not be
completely screened by the noise barriers, the project developer shall either
extend the height of the barrier to provide such protection or incorporate
noise reduction measures in the residential structures. Such measures include
but are not limited to increased setback of structures from highway right-of-
way, utilizing materials that increase sound resistance, using construction
methods to provide air space and reduce vibration, sealing cracks around doors
and windows, reducing window sizes and installing double glazed windows. In
preparing plans for the above described noise reduction, developers shall be
guided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Noise Guide
Book.

Salem Avenue Redevelopment Area Overlay District
1166.01   Purpose.
1166.02   Application for approval.
1166.03   Applicability.
1166.04   Uses.
1166.05   Site design.
1166.06   Architecture.
1166.07   Landscape design.
1166.08   Lighting.
 
 
1166.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Salem Avenue Redevelopment Area is an area in transition.
Disinvestment in the area has accelerated over the last few years. The
deterioration of the Salem Mall and some of the nearby properties has required
intervention by the City of Trotwood in order to try to stabilize the
commercial development in the area. The City’s commitment to the redevelopment
of the area, including making significant financial investment in the area, has
necessitated creation and adoption of new development procedures in order to
assure quality development and redevelopment in the SARA.
   (b)    To that end, the City has adopted the following regulations and
procedures for the land and buildings known as the Salem Avenue Redevelopment
Area. These guidelines are intended to assist architects, contractors and
developers as they prepare for submission of applications for development or
redevelopment in the SARA.
(Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.02 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)    All applications for zoning permits, sign permits and development
approvals shall be subject to review and approval under the following Design
and Development Guidelines. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to determine if the application should not be required to follow the
application and review procedure. Reasons under which an application could be
considered to be exempt may be as follows:
      (1)   The proposed change or modification of the development is minor.
Such changes include but are not limited to minor changes to off-street
parking, repairs to existing buildings which do not alter the structure design
changes to building interiors, as well as any other minor changes.
      (2)    The application already meets the guidelines.
      (3)   The application is for an aspect of a development previously
approved under these guidelines.
   (b)    Applications shall be submitted to the Department of Planning and
Economic Development for processing. The Planning and Zoning Administrator
shall review all applications for completeness.  If an application is deemed
incomplete the application shall be returned to the applicant for completion;
once completed, the application shall be considered officially filed.
   (c)    All applications shall then be forwarded to all City development-
related Departments (Planning, Engineering, Economic Development, Fire and
pertinent public water and sewer Departments) for review and comment.
Simultaneously, applications shall be forwarded to the Design Review Committee
for review and comment.
   (d)    Comments from Staff, Departments and the Design Review Committee
shall be coordinated by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and sent to the
applicant for response and revision no later than fifteen (15) working days
from the date the application is considered officially filed.
   (e)    Upon completion of the review and response phase of the application
process, the application and all pertinent documents, along with all review
comments, shall be forwarded to Planning Commission for Public Hearing. The
hearing shall be held at the next regularly scheduled Planning Commission
meeting which allows for fulfillment of the public notification requirements.
   (f)    Following public hearing and discussion, Planning Commission shall
approve, disapprove, approve with conditions, or remand the application to the
applicant for modification. The decision of the Planning Commission shall be
considered final unless the applicant files an appeal of denial to City
Council.
   (g)   No application made pursuant to this section that is substantially
similar to an application that has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be
accepted for one year from the date of the denial. The Planning and Zoning
Administrator shall determine if a similar application differs enough to be
considered a different application and not subject to this subsection.
(Ord. 07-25. Passed 5-5-25.)
1166.03 APPLICABILITY.
   These guidelines are applicable to all new and existing commercial
development (retail and service) in the Salem Avenue Redevelopment Area (SARA).
Commercial development includes, but is not limited to, large and medium size
“box” stores, inline (strip) multiple tenant retail, multiple tenant shopping
centers that incorporate inline shops and larger anchor tenant spaces,
commercial pad sites associated with a larger center and freestanding
commercial buildings. The guidelines are to be applied throughout the SARA and
are intended to respond to the varying conditions and constraints inherent to
individual site and contextual settings.
(Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.04 USES.
   (a)    Permitted and Conditional Uses in the Salem Avenue Redevelopment Area
(SARA) shall be those uses permitted in the R-B Regional Business District,
except as modified herein. Uses listed below as not permitted may be considered
for exception upon application to the Planning Commission for consideration as
a conditional use in the SARA Overlay District. Approval may be granted by
Planning Commission only upon demonstration that the proposed use is compatible
with other uses in the District and carries out the intent of the SARA
District.
 
   (b)    Uses not permitted.
      (1)    The following Retail Uses shall not be permitted:
A.   Second Hand and used goods stores. This shall not exclude Antique Stores
as defined as follows:
Antiques (Latin antiquus, old) are objects which have reached an age which
makes them a witness of a previous era in human society. Antiques are usually
objects which show some degree of craftsmanship, or society, an antique is
above all an object whose atypical construction and age give it a market value
superior to similar objects of recent manufacture.
The definition of antique varies from source to source, product to product and
year to year. But, some time-tested definitions of antique deserve
consideration:
An item which is at least 100 years old and is collected or desirable due to
rarity, condition, utility, or some other unique feature. Motor vehicles, tools
and other items subject to vigorous use in contrast, may be considered antiques
in the U.S. if older than 25 years, and some electronic gadgets of more recent
vintage may be considered antiques.
 
Antique (noun) - Any piece of furniture or decorative object or the like
produced in a former period and valuable because of its beauty or rarity.
         B.   Carry-outs and other businesses primarily retailing beer, wine
and diluted alcohol.
         C.   Weapon Sales as a primary use.
         D.   Pawnshops
         E.   Adult businesses
         F.   Used vehicle sales, except as an accessory to a new car
dealership on the same or adjacent parcel.
         G.   Truck and motorcycle sales, service, rental and leasing.
         H.   Taverns, bars and nightclubs except as an integral part of a
hotel or restaurant.
      (2)    The following Commercial Recreation Uses shall not be permitted:
         A.   Adult businesses
         B.   Outdoor recreation, except publicly-owned facilities
         C.   Bingo Halls, pool halls, shooting ranges, penny arcades
      (3)   The following Personal and Professional Services shall not be
         permitted:

            facilities
         B.   Hospitals
         C.   Funeral homes and mortuaries
         D.   Car Washes
         E.    Adult and child day-care facilities
   (4)    The following Miscellaneous Uses shall not be permitted:
         A.   Storage and warehouse facilities, including mini-warehouses
            (Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.05 SITE DESIGN.
   (a)    The site design of commercial development is one of the most critical
aspects of a successful project. Decisions made at the conceptual design stage
have repercussions throughout the design development process. This section
begins with a listing of some of the more common components of commercial site
development.
   (b)    The main components of commercial site design that should be
considered throughout the design development process include:
      (1)   Buildings, walls, and other architectural features
      (2)   Service, loading, refuse collection areas and storage areas
      (3)   Utility infrastructure and wireless communications infrastructure
      (4)   Required open spaces, special user amenities (i.e. pedestrian
plazas, enhanced pedestrian zones) and other special features (i.e. focal
architectural elements, landscape features and public art).
      (5)   Parking lots, parking structures, parking canopies and vehicular
circulation/access
      (6)   Pedestrian circulation systems, transit facilities, and bicycle
facilities
      (7)   Drive through facilities including associated equipment, signage
and circulation
      (8)   Ancillary uses (i.e. - ATM’s, retail kiosks, vending equipment and
news racks)
      (9)   Open air display and sales (i.e. garden shops, propane, and
seasonal items such as firewood)
      (10)   Shopping cart storage and collection areas
   (c)    Site designs should respond to local contextual influences and to the
site designs of adjoining developments. Elements that could be coordinated
between adjacent sites include:
      (1)   Shared driveways for accessing perimeter streets
      (2)   Linkages of internal vehicular circulation systems
      (3)   Linkages of interior pedestrian systems with the systems of
adjoining sites
      (4)   Linkages/continuation of open space systems
      (5)   Perimeter open space and landscape buffers zones
      (6)   Areas and access for service and refuse collection
      (7)   Drainage and retention facilities
      (8)   Linkages of other networks systems and functional areas where a    
coordinated site design approach will benefit the cohesiveness of the larger
area
   (d)    Parking Facilities.
      (1)   Commercial developments are encouraged to not exceed parking
requirements imposed by the City and to seek opportunities and incorporate
features intended to reduce the dependence on the automobile (i.e. – enhanced
accessibility to transit and pedestrian connectivity).
      (2)   Surface parking areas and other expansive areas of paved surfaces
should be broken up with landscape planting. Ideally, in larger commercial
developments, surface parking should be planned in sub-areas accommodating 250
to 300 vehicles. Each parking sub-area should be separated by a 15 to 20-foot
wide landscape planting area or a more significant landscape/building area.
      (3)   Where parking areas occur adjacent to outdoor activity areas, a
landscape buffer should be provided to reduce the impact of the parking area.
      (4)   Parking lots shall be designed with landscape elements and
architectural features such as canoes and islands to reduce the impact of large
expanses of asphalt and to discourage cross-lot taxiing by drivers.
      (5)   Wherever possible vehicular access to parking lots shall be
concentrated and combined to common driveways. Driveway entrances shall be
designed to provide free flowing right of way for entering traffic without
cross traffic conflicts.
   (e)    Pedestrian, Transit and Bicycle Facilities.
      (1)   Clearly visible and direct pedestrian paths should be established
between neighboring buildings, between buildings and outlying parking areas and
between buildings and transit facilities.
      (2)   Where pedestrian circulation paths cross vehicular routes, a change
in paving materials, textures or colors should be provided to emphasize the
conflict point, improve visibility, enhance safety and provide added aesthetic
appeal.
      (3)   Bicycle parking should be provided at locations that do not
obstruct the flow of pedestrians, are easily identifiable and visible and
convenient to customer entrances.
      (4)   Access paths (crosswalks) between parking lots/spaces and store
buildings shall be clearly defined by use of materials which will distinguish
the cross walks from parking lot paving materials. Materials such as
architectural concrete, brick, stone, etc. shall be used.
   (f)    On-site Amenities and Special Features.
      (1)   Commercial centers should feature a pedestrian space(s) scaled with
respect to the size and demands of the particular use. The space(s) should
incorporate landscaping, shaded areas and seating opportunities for customers
and employees.
      (2)   When defining the best area(s) for pedestrian enhancements,
internal locations, edge locations and corner locations should all be
considered. The best area(s) for enhanced pedestrian space(s) should be the
area(s) that provides the greatest benefit to the most users and improve
functional relationships and linkages internally and/or to adjoining areas.
   (g)    Service, Refuse Collection and Utilities.
      (1)   Service areas, storage areas and refuse enclosures should be
oriented away from public view and screened from public areas. In larger
commercial developments, trash collection, service and loading areas should be
separated from main circulation and parking areas. Common usage of these
facilities is encouraged.
      (2)   Shopping carts should be stored within the building or screened
with a wall that is integral to the architectural design of the adjoining
building.
      (3)   Utility cabinets and pedestals should not be located within parking
lot landscape islands or public right of way where they cannot be screened, are
exposed to damage from vehicles and/or present a visual hazard to drivers or
pedestrians. Utility cabinets, pedestals and other above ground utility
infrastructure should be clustered and screened to the extent allowable by
operation requirements and should be painted or integrally colored a tone that
is neutral to its setting. Consideration should also be given to accessibility
of such facilities for required service and maintenance.
   (h)    Drive-through Facilities.
      (1)   Drive-through windows, menu boards, equipment, and associated
stacking lanes should be located to minimize impacts on adjacent residential
areas and should be adequately screened from public view and the view of
adjacent sites.
      (2)   Circulation should allow for adequate length of stacking for drive
through facilities that do not interfere with the movement of traffic (on or
off-site) and/or pedestrian areas.
      (3)   Consider drive-through windows that incorporate an architectural
covering consistent with the design theme of the building. Coverings over
drive- throughs can help to achieve more variation to building mass and added
comfort for users.
   (i)    Open Air Display and Sales.
      (1)   Outdoor display and sales areas (i.e. propane sales, firewood
displays, news racks, vending machines and amusements) should be well organized
within a designated zone and not prominent from off-site views.
      (2)   No outside audio speakers shall be allowed within the Redevelopment
Area.
   (j)    ATM’s, Sales Kiosks and Other Ancillary Uses.  Walk-up ATM’s, vending
machines and similar uses should be integrated into existing or planned
buildings. Freestanding sales kiosks are discouraged.
(Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.06 ARCHITECTURE.
   (a)    The intent of the architectural guidelines is to ensure a base level
of quality architecture that is responsive to its context and enhances the
esthetic identity of the Salem Avenue Development Area rather than a design
solution that is based on a standardized formula or market prototype
superimposed on the selected site.
   (b)    Character and Context.
      (1)   Building design should take into consideration the unique qualities
and the dominant character of the surrounding area.
      (2)   Buildings that derive their image primarily from applied treatments
that express corporate identity are discouraged.
      (3)   Buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building, or
portion of the building to identify a particular user is generally discouraged,
particularly where the proposed architectural design is the result of a
corporate or franchise prototype design.
      (4)   The design of a building that occupies a pad or portion of a
building within a planned project or shopping center should share similar
design characteristics and design vocabulary. Precise replication is not
desirable, instead utilizing similar colors, materials and textures as well as
repeating patterns, rhythms and proportions found within the architecture of
other buildings in the center can be utilized to achieve unity.
   (c)    Scale and Proportion of Development.
      (1)    Massing.
         A.   The design of a building should reduce its perceived height by
dividing the building mass into smaller scale components. One way to achieve
this breakdown is to provide a well-defined base, middle and top to the
building.
         B.   A solid building base may be achieved by elements such as low
planters and walls, base planting, a base architectural veneer banding
(wainscot) and treatments defined by a different material, texture or color.
         C.   A solid building base (and a more articulated building mass) may
be achieved by the addition of covered walkways, trellises or architectural
awnings that provide deep shadow at ground level.
         D.   Using features such as distinct and multiple architectural roof
forms, clearly pronounced eaves, and distinct parapet designs and cornice
treatments may achieve a well-defined building top.
      (2)   The design of a building should reduce its apparent bulk by
dividing the building into smaller masses. Ideally, the distinction of each
mass should relate to the internal function of the building and may indicate a
logical hierarchy for breaking down the mass of the building.
         A.   The apparent mass of a building may be further reduced by the
following techniques:
            1.   Variations in roof form and parapet heights
            2.   Incorporating clearly pronounced recesses and projections
            3.   Introduction of wall plane off-sets (dimension established by
building module)
            4.   Use of other reveals and projections and subtle changes in
texture and color of wall surfaces
            5.   Use of deep set windows with mullions
            6.   Use of ground level arcades and second floor galleries/
balconies
            7.   Use of protected and recessed entries
            8.   Use of vertical accents or focal points
      (3)   Structures designed with HVAC, air handling equipment and other
similar equipment on the roof of the structure shall be constructed so parapet
walls extend to a height which will screen such equipment from adjacent
roadways and properties. As a general rule, parapet heights should not exceed
one-third the dimension of the adjacent grade to structural roof element
measurement.
      (4)   Buildings or portions of a building mass over 50 feet wide are
encouraged to divide their elevations into smaller parts. A pronounced change
in massing, pronounced changes in wall planes (fenestrations, crenellations,
façade indentations) and introducing significant variations in the cornice/
roofline are all possible methods to accomplish the desired divisions of
elevations into smaller parts.
      (5)   Excessive use of decorative detail applied to the surface of a
building is discouraged.
   (d)    Design of Pedestrian Frontages.
      (1)   Building frontages and sides of buildings oriented to the street or
other public areas (i.e. parks, open space, transit facilities) should
incorporate a combination of arcades, pedestrian level display windows,
storefronts, and store entrances.
      (2)   Walkways/sidewalks along the front of buildings shall be wide
enough to provide ease of passage by pedestrians away from passing vehicles.
      (3)   Buildings frontages should exhibit human scale detail, windows and
other openings along ground floor pedestrian areas.
   (e)    Architectural Details, Materials and Colors.
      (1)   Primary entrances to buildings should be distinguished with façade
variations, porticos, roof variations, recesses or projections, or other
integral building forms.
      (2)   Building colors should emphasize muted earth tones. The use of
highly reflective or glossy materials should be limited and is not appropriate
in all contexts.
      (3)   Rich materials and a variety of materials are desirable on both the
wall planes, roofs and ground plane. If stone or decorative block veneers are
incorporated, the material should be used to highlight significant building
features and massed elements.
      (4)   All sides of a building should express consistent architectural
detail and character. All site walls and screen walls should be architecturally
integrated with the building or as approved as part of an overall master plan
area.
      (5)   Screening devices, site walls and enclosed service, loading and
refuse areas should be designed to be an integral part of the building
architecture.
      (6)   Drive through elements should be architecturally integrated into
the building, rather than appearing to be applied or “stuck on” to the
building.
      (7)   Outside windows and doors shall not be covered with bars, grilles,
cages or other protective and/or security devices.
         (Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.07 LANDSCAPE DESIGN.
   (a)    Landscaping should be integral to the overall design concept and
should be carefully planned to serve more than one purpose. The intent of these
guidelines is to ensure that landscape design contributes to the overall
appearance and function of the site as well as the streetscape.
      (1)   All new property development and substantial expansion of existing
structures as defined in Chapter
1175 shall meet the requirements for Buffer yards and Landscaping of Chapter
1175.
      (2)   Landscaping should blend with the dominant existing or planned
streetscape and character of the area.
      (3)   Landscaping should be provided along and against all buildings to
anchor it to the surrounding environment and to soften the structure. In-ground
landscaping should comprise the majority of the landscaping requirement. Raised
planters are acceptable when designed to accentuate the architecture and or
enhance pedestrian areas.
      (4)   Storefront areas should incorporate significant landscaping
(including canopy trees). Frontage design and signage locations should be
coordinated with the placement of plant material.
      (5)   Trees should be used throughout paved areas and along pedestrian
pathways to provide shade and to reduce heat build-up and glare. Landscape
through any corridors adjoining parking areas should be a minimum of twenty
feet in width when a parking module exceeds 250 cars.
      (6)   A landscape buffer should be provided to screen commercial uses
from residential areas.
      (7)   Dense landscaping and/or architectural treatments should be
provided to screen unattractive views and features such as storage areas, trash
enclosures, utility cabinets and other similar elements.
      (8)   The site design for projects located at street corners should
provide special landscape treatment at street intersections to anchor the
corner.
      (9)   The use of mature trees is encouraged to provide an immediate
impact especially when used in buffering adjacent uses.
      (10)   Proper maintenance and timely replacement of plant material is
expected and required.
      (11)   Curbing should be installed at the edges of all planter areas
adjacent to automobile circulation and parking areas.
         (Ord. 09-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
1166.08 LIGHTING.
   (a)    Site lighting, security lighting and architectural/landscape lighting
should provide the user with illumination levels appropriate for the designed
activity (i.e. parking, walking). Illumination levels should also be reasonably
uniform throughout the site and strive to minimize glare.
   (b)    General Lighting Standards.
      (1)   Avoid competing light levels and maintain balanced light levels on-
site and between adjacent properties. The exterior lighting design must take
into account the background lighting levels, lighting from other sources, and
characteristics of the surrounding area.
      (2)   Recommended light level guidelines and uniformity ratios
established by the Illumination Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) in
the IESNA Lighting Handbook (current edition) should be considered along with
the predominant lighting characteristics of the surrounding area when
determining appropriate solutions to lighting design.
      (3)   Light glare or excess brightness must be minimized. Cut-off
fixtures, mounting heights, and the elevation of potential viewers must all be
considered for effectively controlling glare by directing light below the
horizontal.
      (4)   Light trespass beyond property lines should be controlled by
shielding or aiming fixtures away from residential properties. Light trespass
should not exceed ambient levels.
      (5)   Security lighting and lighting of service areas should meet the
standards listed above.
   (c)    Architectural and Landscape Lighting.
      (1)   Architectural lighting should be used to highlight special features
only. Lighting of expansive wall planes or the use of architectural lighting
that results in hot spots on walls or roof planes should be avoided.
      (2)   Landscape feature lighting and lighting at the pedestrian level is
encouraged.

         (Ord. 1-99. Passed 1-19-99.)
1175.05 BUFFERYARD MATERIALS AND STANDARDS.
   New development shall provide buffering yards as provided in Section
1175.10. Existing vegetation shall be preserved in accordance to acceptable
nursery industry procedures. The following items are suitable for screening use
individually or in combination with each other provided they create a dense
screen, subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission. Nursery
stock identification tags shall not be removed from any planting prior to
inspection and approval of final installation by the City.
   (a)   Walls and Fences. When walls or fences are used to fulfill screening
requirements, they shall be detailed on the plan. They are to be of weather-
proof materials. This includes pressure treating or painting of lumber if it is
not redwood or cedar and using aluminum or galvanized hardware. Chain link
fences with or without wooded or synthetic slat material shall not be allowed
when used to satisfy bufferyard and landscaping requirements.
   (b)   Plants. All plants are to be living and part of the acceptable plants
list identified in the following section. Plant materials used in conformance
with the provision of this section shall conform to the standards of the
American Association of Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspection
required under state regulations. Trees shall be balled and burlapped or in
containers. Shrubs, vines and ground covers can be planted as bare root as well
as balled and burlapped or containers.
      (1)   Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of at
least 2½ inches conforming to acceptable nursery industry procedures at the
time of planting. If deciduous trees are to be used for screening purposes,
additional materials listed in this Section must be used to create a dense
buffer.
      (2)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet
(6') in height at the time of planting. Evergreen plantings shall be designed
to provide an effective, dense screen within four (4) years of planting.
      (3)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least thirty-six
inches (36") in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges shall be
designed to provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at least
six feet (6') within four (4) years after the date of the final approval of
each planting. The height at installation of the planting shall be measured
from the level of the surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the
screening.
      (4)   Grass or ground cover. Grass of the Fescus (Gramineak) or Bluegrass
(Poaceae) family shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns
in Montgomery County. In swales or other areas subject to erosion, solid sod,
erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch shall be used and nurse grass seed
shall be sown for immediate protection until complete coverage otherwise is
achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or
diseases. Ground cover shall be planted in such a manner as to provide 75%
complete coverage after two growing seasons.
      (5)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds may be used as physical barriers which
block or screen a view. Differences in elevation between areas requiring
screening does not constitute an earth mound. Earth mounds shall be constructed
of earthen materials and shall conform to the following standards:
         A.   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one vertical
(3:1) and the design shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission to ensure
that proper erosion prevention and control practices have been utilized.
         B.   Berms and earthforms shall be designed with physical variations
in height and alignment throughout their length.
         C.   Landscape plant material installed on berms and earthforms shall
be arranged in an irregular pattern to accentuate the physical variation and
achieve a natural appearance.
         D.   The landscape plan shall show sufficient detail, including a plan
and profile of the berm or earthform, soil types and construction techniques to
demonstrate compliance with the above provisions.
         E.   Berms and earthforms shall be located and designed to minimize
the disturbance to existing trees located on the site or adjacent thereto.
         F.   No part of any berm or earthform which is elevated more than
eighteen inches (18") above natural grade shall be located within twenty feet
(20') of any right-of-way or property line.
         G.   Adequate ground cover shall be used and maintained to prevent
erosion of the earth mound.
   (c)   Maintenance of Landscaping and Bufferyards. All landscaping materials
shall be installed and maintained according to accepted nursery industry
procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
property maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a
proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times.
All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by
the next planting period, whichever comes first. Violation of these
installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Zoning
Administrator to refuse a building occupancy permit, require replacement of the
landscape material or institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of
this section. Landscaping that cannot be installed because of inclement weather
shall be installed as soon as weather permits as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. In cases where landscaping cannot be installed prior to issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, a landscaping bond shall be provided to the City
in an amount sufficient to pay for all required grass and landscaping
requirements. Any individual or single landscaped area larger than 5,000 square
feet shall be irrigated with an in-ground sprinkler system.
   (d)   Bufferyard Establishment. Once a bufferyard has been approved by the
Planning Commission and established by the owner, it may not be used, disturbed
or altered for any purpose.
      (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1175.06 CONFLICTS IN REQUIREMENTS.
   When an activity or land use falls under more than one of the categories
listed in the matrix in Section
1175.10, the most stringent of the requirements shall be applied.
(Ord. 1-99. Passed 1-19-99.)
1175.07 EASEMENTS, RIGHT-OF-WAY AND SETBACKS.
   Required landscaping may be placed wholly or partially in utility or other
easements providing all requirements can be fulfilled and approval is granted
by the holder of the easements. Trees placed under overhead utility wires must
be from List B, in Section
1175.13.
   Landscaping must also be placed in the required area between the property
line and the front, rear and side yard setbacks.
   In no case, however, shall landscaping and bufferyards be established so as
to block the sight distance at street or drive intersections. Ground cover and
trees with at least eight feet of limbless trunk shall be permitted within the
sight distance triangle. In the case of a city street intersection, the sight
triangle shall consist of the area between points twenty feet (20') along both
intersecting streets from their respective edge of pavements.
(Ord. 1-99. Passed 1-19-99.)
1175.08 LANDSCAPING FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   Landscaping for any outdoor parking area shall be provided around the
perimeter as indicated in the matrix in Section
1175.10. Parking areas containing six (6) spaces or larger shall provide for
perimeter landscaping. Parking areas containing more than 6,000 square feet of
area or 20 or more vehicular parking spaces, whichever is less, shall provide
interior landscaping of the peninsular or island types of uncompacted, well-
drained soil as well as perimeter landscaping. For each 100 square feet or
fraction thereof of parking area, at least five square feet of landscape area
shall be provided.
   (a)   Interior Landscape Requirements.
      (1)   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be 64 sq.
ft. with a four-foot minimum dimension to all trees from edge of pavement where
vehicles overhang.
      (2)   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no individual landscape area shall be
larger than 350 square feet in size in parking areas less than 30,000 square
feet and no individual area shall be larger than 1,500 square feet in parking
areas over 30,000 square feet. In both cases, the least dimension of any
required area shall be four feet minimum dimension to all trees from edge of
pavement where vehicles overhang. Individual landscape areas larger than above
are permitted as long as the additional area is in excess of the required
minimum total.
   (b)   Minimum Tree Specifications.
      (1)   A 1¾" diameter tree for medium and large trees and 1¼" diameter
tree for small trees (as measured 6 inches above ground) shall be planted for
each 5,000 sq. ft. of total ground coverage, structures and pavement for
vehicular use. Each island in a vehicular use area shall contain at least one
(1) tree. Refer to Plant List for listing of trees.
      (2)   To retain visibility, trees shall have a clear trunk of at least
five feet above the ground. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs,
and/or ground cover, not to exceed three feet (3') in height.
   (c)   Perimeter Landscaping for Parking Lots. Parking lots shall have
perimeter buffer zones of a minimum width of 6½ feet containing evergreen plant
material that will achieve an effective, dense screen of a height of at least
three feet at the time of installation. Perimeter buffer zone shall also
contain deciduous trees.
   (d)   Vehicle Overhang. Parked vehicles may not hang over the interior
landscaped area. Concrete or other wheel stops shall be provided to ensure no
overhang or penetration on the landscaped area.
   (e)   Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the
easements not occupied by other landscaped material. Such material fulfills
required interior or perimeter landscaping.
   (f)   A system which provides irrigation to all planted materials shall be
installed at the time of installing plantings.
      (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1175.09 LANDSCAPING FOR SERVICE STRUCTURES.
   Service structures shall include but not be limited to loading docks,
propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend
above electrical and other equipment or elements providing service to a
building or a site. Structures may be grouped together. However, screening
height shall be based upon the tallest of the structures.
   (a)   Location of Screening. A continuous planting of evergreen, fence or
wall of earth must enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such
structure must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening
material shall be one foot more than the height of the enclosed structure, but
shall not be required to exceed 10 feet in height. Whenever a service structure
is located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping material shall be of
an average height sufficient to meet the height requirements set out in this
section. Whenever service structures are screened by plant material, such
material may count towards the fulfillment of required interior or perimeter
landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be required within an area screened
for service structures.
   (b)   Curbs to Protect Screening Material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied
or removed mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the placement of
the container shall be provided within the screening material. The curbing
shall be at least one foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent
possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.

1175.14 MONARCH TREE PROTECTION.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to protect existing trees
from destructive pruning practices and to preserve “Monarch Trees” as defined
herein. It is thereby further the purpose of this section to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare, to beautify and enhance improved and
undeveloped land, to preserve and protect both the natural and historic
amenities within the City, and to ensure that the destruction of Monarch Trees
and the unauthorized pruning of other trees within the City of Trotwood does
not reduce property values.
   (b)   Removal of Monarch Trees Prohibited.
      (1)   No person, firm, organization, society, association or corporation,
or any agent or representative thereof shall directly or indirectly destroy or
remove any Monarch Tree, unless otherwise authorized under provisions of this
section, in which case a permit from the City of Trotwood for such removal may
be required.
      (2)   This section shall not restrict the ability of the City, public
utilities, and electric suppliers from maintaining reasonable safe clearance
around utility lines with full disclosure to the City of Trotwood and approval
of a permit by the Zoning Administrator. Within City easements and road rights-
of- way, the Director of Public Works may authorize the pruning or removal of
trees as necessary to maintain the easement and rights-of-way.
   (c)   Submission of Landscape Plans. Where application for a building or
zoning permit or any other construction activity is submitted to the City of
Trotwood, a landscape plan in accordance with the requirements of Chapter
1175 of this Ordinance shall be submitted. In addition, the following
information with regard to Monarch Trees, shall also be submitted along with
any other information required to be submitted with the application.
      (1)   A survey of Monarch Trees, if any; and
      (2)   Specifications for protection of Monarch Trees or other trees to be
maintained during development.
   (d)   Exceptions/Appeals.
      (1)   In the event that any tree shall be determined to be in hazardous
or dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, safety, or welfare,
and to require immediate removal without delay, written authorization shall be
given by the Zoning Administrator and the tree removed, except where it is
deemed that an emergency exists within a public road right-of-way, or public
easements, the Director of Public Works may authorize the removal of trees as
necessary to protect the public health and safety.
      (2)   During the period of an emergency, such as a tornado, hurricane,
ice storm, flood, or any other act of nature, the requirements of this section
may be waived by the Zoning Administrator or Trotwood Tree Preservation Board.
      (3)   Any decision of the Zoning Administrator relative to the
administration of the requirements of this section may be appealed to the
Trotwood Tree Preservation Board.
      (4)   Commercial Timber Operations - Trees grown specifically for sale or
harvest by commercial nurseries are exempt from the provisions of this section.
   (e)   Application and Scope. Protection of Monarch Trees. The destruction of
any Monarch Tree is prohibited. All Monarch Trees must be shown on subdivision
plats. Lots and roadways shall not be sited so as to place a Monarch Tree in a
location that will require the removal of that tree for construction of a
dwelling unit or road.
   (f)   Protective Barricades. Protective barricades shall be placed around
all Monarch trees located in development areas prior to the commencement of any
work, and shall remain in place until development activities are complete or
construction in accordance with standards set forth in this section commences.
The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building
materials, dirt, or other construction materials, debris, vehicles, and
development activities. Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from
the base of Monarch Trees. Protective barricades shall be placed at a minimum
distance equal to ten (10') feet from the base of a Monarch Tree, plus an
additional one (1') foot for each additional one (1") inch DBH greater than ten
(10") inches DBH or to drip line, whichever is greater.
   (g)   Passive Tree Protection. Passive forms of tree protection may be
utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land
disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or
flagging (heavy mill, minimum two (2") inches wide). All passive tree
protection must be accompanied by “Keep Out” or “Tree Protection Area” signage.
   (h)   Encroachment. 
      (1)   Construction within the protective barricade. Changes in grade or
construction of impervious surfaces or utilities within the required protective
barricade shall be permitted subject to the following guidelines: construction
of impervious surfaces shall not be permitted within five (5') feet of the base
of the Monarch Tree, unless special construction methods, including, but not
limited to, tree feeders and porous paving materials are used and certified as
acceptable by a reputable tree service, arborist, or other qualified
organization.
      (2)   Roots outside barricade. All roots outside of the protective
barricade to be removed during the development shall be served clean and a two
(2") inch layer of mulch be applied over the surface of exposed roots during
development.
   (i)   Trenching. The installation of utilities through a protective zone
should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. If roots must be cut,
proper root pruning procedures must be employed.
   (j)   Remedial Procedures/Pruning.  
      (1)   Pruning.
         A.   Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be
implemented when encroachment within protective zones either will cause damage
or has caused damage to either the tree or the tree growing site, and the
damage is repairable. If encroachment is anticipated, or has happened, these
practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve survival. The
following practices shall be applied where appropriate.
            1.   Pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist
Association (NAA) in “Pruning Standards for Shade Trees” shall apply. Any
person or company representing themselves as pruners or nurserymen shall
require a permit from the City of Trotwood and all pruning shall be performed
to National Arborist Association standards. All trees on City owned property or
within City rights-of-way shall be pruned by pruners licensed by the City of
Trotwood and shall prune according to National Arborist Association Standards.
      (2)   Fertilizer. Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees
stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting root development. Information
regarding appropriate fertilizers and application rates may be obtained from
the County Soil Conservation Office.
      (3)   Soil.
         A.   A tree’s ability for adequate root development, and ultimately
its chances for survival, are improved with reclamation of the growing site.
         B.   Wherever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural
grade. Unnecessary fill, compaction, erosion sedimentation, concrete washout,
and construction debris should be removed. When machinery is required for site
improvement, it is recommended that a “Bobcat” or similar lightweight, rubber
tire vehicle be used so as to minimize soil compaction.
         C.   Compacted soil within the critical root zones of trees should be
aerated. This is best accomplished with a two (2") inch diameter auger. Holes
should be drilled to a depth of six (6") inches to twelve (12") inches,
approximately two (2') to three (3') feet apart, and radiating outward from the
tree’s trunk in a bicycle spoke configuration. This aeration technique is also
recommended for areas affected by minor fill or the sedimentation of erosion
materials.
         D.   The air exchange, nutrient, and water-holding capabilities of
soils can be improved with soil amendments. This is best accomplished by back-
filling holes from aeration, with mineral amendments such as perlite,
vermiculite, isolate and the like.
         E.   A four (4") to six (6") inch layer of mulch material, such as
pine straw, pine bark, or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of
trees on construction sites is extremely beneficial. These benefits include:
            1.   Conservation of soil moisture.
            2.   Reduced rainfall runoff and erosion.
            3.   Reduced soil compaction from construction activities.
            4.   Reduced competition from grasses and weeds.
            5.   Increased soil fertility.
            6.   Improved soil structure.
            7.   Moderation of soil temperature, with a subsequent increase in
root development activity.
   (k)   Tree Removal, Relocation and Replacement.
      (1)   Tree replacement required. Removal of each Monarch Tree without
approval of the City of Trotwood Preservation Board is a violation of this
chapter and shall require replacement in caliper inches (American Nursery Stock
Standard) equal to the number of inches DBH (Diameter of Tree measured at
Breast Height) removed from the site. For example, a twenty (20") inch tree
removed could be replaced with ten (10) trees each of which is two (2") inches
in diameter. A minimum diameter of one and three- quarters (1 3/4") inches
shall be allowed for replacement trees.
      (2)   Relocation of a Monarch Tree. Relocation is accomplished by
relocating the protected tree on land under the same ownership which is to be
developed pursuant to the same development order.
      (3)   Replanting schedule standards.
         A.   To prevent a monoculture among plantings, the City shall require
diversity in the plantings required.
         B.   Required number of tree types:
            1.   Five (5) to ten (10) trees. Minimum two (2) types of trees to
be planted.
            2.   Ten (10) to twenty (20) trees. Minimum four (4) types of trees
to be planted.
            3.   Twenty (20) to one hundred (100) trees. Minimum five (5) types
of trees to be planted.
            4.   Greater than one hundred (100) trees. Minimum of seven (7)
types of trees to be planted.
            5.   Fee in lieu of replacement trees. In cases where replacement
trees cannot be adequately accommodated on a site, the developer/owner shall,
in lieu of planting the trees, pay a fee to the City of Trotwood, equal to the
fair market cost of the installed trees that would be required on the site.
This money shall be put into a special account (“Tree Bank”) to be used solely
for the beautification of public lands. The Trotwood Preservation Board shall
make a recommendation to City Council as to whether or not to accept the fee or
require the onsite placement of the trees. The Tree Preservation Board shall
recommend and approve expenditures from the “Tree Bank”.
            6.   At least one (1) of the replacement trees shall be of the same
species as the removed Monarch Tree.
            7.   If any of the replacement trees are damaged or diseased during
the first two (2) years after planting, they shall be replaced.

space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross leasable
horizontal area of all floors of a non-residential building.
   (b)   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units
installed or indicated for, each twenty (20) lineal inches of seating
facilities.
   (c)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
   (d)   Parking space requirements for a use not specifically mentioned in
this ordinance shall be determined by using the most similar and restrictive
parking space requirement as specified by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   When the building floor area is designated as the standard for

1191.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter, governing wireless telecommunication facilities, is
established to provide for the construction, erection, maintenance, extension
and removal of such facilities. The purpose of this chapter is to balance the
competing interests created by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996
(Public Law 104-104) and the interests of the City of Trotwood in regulating
wireless telecommunication towers and related facilities in order to:
   (a)   Accommodate the need for wireless telecommunication facilities while
regulating the location and number of such facilities within the City;
   (b)   Minimize adverse visual effects of wireless telecommunication
facilities and support structures through proper location, design, screening
and camouflaging;
   (c)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from wireless
telecommunication facilities and support structures.
   (d)   Encourage the joint use of new and existing wireless telecommunication
facilities and support structures in order to reduce the number of such
structures needed in the future.
   (e)   Require public properties to be considered first for location of
wireless telecommunication facilities in order to provide financial benefit to
the public from the construction and use of such facilities.
      (Ord. 45-08. Passed 12-15-08.)
1191.02 DEFINITIONS.

compliance of the facility with all governmental requirements, including, but
not limited to, the structural integrity and stability of any towers or
antennae, electrical safety standards and auxiliary power source safety
standards.
   (m)   Except as required by law, no antenna or tower shall be illuminated
and no lighting fixtures or signs shall be attached to the antenna or tower. If
lighting is required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, the
most visually non- obtrusive state-of-the-art lighting available shall be used,
unless otherwise required by the FAA.
   (n)   A security fence not less than eight (8) feet in height shall fully
enclose those portions of the wireless telecommunication facility which come in

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

In the absence of substantiation which is reasonably acceptable to the Building
Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer, he shall determine, compute, or estimate a
valuation in accordance with generally accepted methods of estimating and may,
for such purpose refer to other valuations submitted for comparable work
involved.
   (b)   Notification to County Auditor. When the Building Inspector/Code
Enforcement Officer issues a permit for the wrecking or moving of any building
or structure, or where the estimated cost of work to be done, whether for new
construction, extension, alteration, or repair, would substantially affect the
taxable value, he shall notify the County Auditor so that appropriate
adjustments may be reflected on the County tax duplicate.
   (c)   Building Construction, Alteration, or Repair Permits. Fees for permits
for the construction, extension, alteration, or repair of any building or

(Ord. 10-87. Passed 4-6-87.)
1341.11 DUTIES AND POWER OF CODE OFFICIAL.
   (a)   General. The Code Official shall enforce all the provisions of this
Code relative to the maintenance of structures and premises, except as may
otherwise be specifically provided for by other regulations.
   (b)   Notices, Orders and Citations. The Code Official shall issue all
necessary notices, orders and citations to abate illegal or unsafe conditions
to insure compliance with the Code requirements for the safety, health and
general welfare of the public.
   (c)   Inspections. In order to safeguard the safety, health and general
welfare of the public, the Code Official is authorized to enter any structure
or premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections and
performing his duties under this Code.
   (d)   Right of Entry. If any owner, occupant, or other person in charge of a
structure subject to the provisions of this Code refuses, impedes, inhibits,
interferes with, restricts or obstructs entry and free access to any part of
the structure or premises where inspection is authorized by this Code is
sought, the administrative authority may seek, in a court of competent
jurisdiction, an order that such owner, occupant or other person in charge
cease and desist with such interference.
   (e)   Access by Owner or Operator. Every occupant of a structure or premises
shall give the owner or operator thereof, or his agent or employee, access to
any part of such structure or its premises at reasonable times for the purpose
of making such inspection, maintenance, repairs or alterations as are necessary
to comply with the provisions of this Code.
   (f)   Credentials. The Code Official or his authorized representative shall
disclose proper credentials of his respective office for the purpose of
inspecting any and all buildings and premises in the performance of his duties
under this Code.
   (g)   Coordination of Enforcement. Inspection of premises, the issuance of
notices, orders, citations and enforcement thereof shall be the responsibility
of Code Officials so charged by the City. Whenever, in the opinion of a Code
Official initiating an inspection under this Code, it is deemed necessary or
desirable to have inspections by any other department, he shall make reasonable
effort to arrange for the coordination of such inspections so as to minimize
the number of visits by inspectors, and to confer with the other departments
for the purpose of eliminating conflicting orders before any are issued. A
department shall not, however, delay the issuance of any emergency orders which
it determines must be issued.
   (h)   Annual Report. At least annually, the Code Official shall submit to
the Community Development Director or the City Manager a written state of
operations in the form and content as shall be prescribed by such authority.
(Ord. 10-87. Passed 4-6-87.)
1341.12 CONDEMNATION; VACANT STRUCTURES.
   (a)   General. When a structure or part thereof is found by the Code
Official to be unsafe, or when a structure or part thereof is found unfit for
human occupancy or use, or is found unlawful, it may be condemned pursuant to
the provisions of this Code and may be placarded. Such a structure or part
thereof shall be vacated within thirty days after notice of such condemnation
has been given, and shall not be reoccupied without the approval of the Code
Official. In addition, unsafe equipment shall be placarded and placed out of
service.
      (1)   An unsafe structure is one in which all or part thereof is found to
be dangerous to life, health, property or the safety of the public or its
occupants because it is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe,
or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation that it is likely to
partially or completely collapse.
      (2)   Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment, elevator,
moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers or
other equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such
disrepair or condition that it is found to be a hazard to life, health,
property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or structures.
Unsafe equipment may contribute to the finding that the structure is unsafe or
unfit for human occupancy or use.
      (3)   A structure is unfit for human occupancy or use whenever the Code
Official finds that it is unsafe, unlawful or because of the degree in which it
lacks maintenance or is in disrepair, is unsanitary, vermin or rodent infested,
contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary
or heating facilities, or other essential equipment required by this Code, or,
because its location constitutes a hazard to its occupants or to the public.
      (4)   An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be
erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
   (b)   Closing of Vacant Structures. If a structure or part thereof is vacant
and/or unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Code Official may pose a placard of condemnation on
the premise and may order the structure closed up with plywood so as to prevent
such structure from becoming a public nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to
close up to condemned structure within the time specified in the order, the
Code Official shall cause such premises to be closed up with plywood through
any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons,
and, the cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the
condemned structure is located and shall thereafter become a lien upon such
real estate. In addition, any structure which is ordered to be closed up shall
have at least one no trespassing sign posted in a prominent place on each of
its outside walls, and, shall further be characterized by plywood which has
been painted a solid color compatible with the color of the condemned
structure.
(Ord. 10-87. Passed 4-6-87.)
1341.13 NOTICES, ORDERS, AND CITATIONS.
   (a)   Notice to Owners and, when applicable or otherwise required by this
Code, tenants, occupants, holders of legal or equitable liens of record, and
any duly authorized agent of the property owners, if such an agent is known by
the City (collectively referred to herein as "Interested Parties"). Whenever
the Code Official determines that there has been a violation of this Code or
has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, or whenever a
duly authorized Code Official has condemned any structure or equipment under
the provisions of Section
1341.12, the Code Official shall give notice to the owner(s) and, when
applicable or otherwise required by this Code, other Interested Parties in the
manner prescribed below. If a Code Official has condemned the property or part
thereof, the Code Official shall give notice to the owner(s) and to the
occupants of the Code Official's intent to placard and to vacate the property,

withdrawal of the notice by petition to the Property Maintenance Appeals Board.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, such notice shall be
deemed to be properly served on the owner(s) and/or other Interested Parties,
if the notice or a copy thereof is served by one, or more, of the following
methods:
      (1)   Delivered personally; or
      (2)   Sent by certified mail, return receipt requested; or

occupant other than the owner or person responsible for such compliance, a
reasonable time to vacate the property after noncompliance shall be stated.
Owners or persons responsible for compliance shall vacate at the time set for
correction of defects if there is a failure of compliance.
   
   (e)    Citation Tags. The enforcement officer is authorized and directed to
provide citation tags which shall be used for the purpose of giving due notice
and summons to the person or persons responsible for violations of this
Property Maintenance Code.
      (1)    Such citation tags shall be put in writing on an appropriate form,
state the nature of the violation, refer to the section or sections of the Code
violated, and state the appropriate assessment or penalty therefore.
      (2)    Such person or persons, when a citation tag as herein provided is
served to him, shall appear at the place or places designated upon such tag and
shall pay the assessment for the violation noted on the citation.
      (3)    Upon payment of the assessment as provided within the time limit
provided herein, no further action will be taken to prosecute the violation
noted on the citation, provided remedial action, if necessary, is taken.
      (4)    The citation tag as herein provided, shall be sufficient notice,
summons, and legal service thereof for the purpose specified thereon; provided,
however, that the use of such tags shall not prohibit the issuance of either
additional citation tags or a legal notice of violation as provided herein, in
the event such violation is continued or repeated.
   (f)    Citation Tag Assessment. When a violation citation tag has been
issued pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, an amount of seventy-five dollars
($75.00) is hereby assessed upon the violator. If the assessment is paid within
the seventy-two-hour period immediately following the issuance of the citation
tag, all seventy-five dollar ($75.00) assessments are reduced to fifty dollars
($50.00), subject to additional citations and assessment, however, no reduction
of the assessment shall occur without the violation being brought into
compliance. Assessments shall be collected by the appropriately designated
authority. Failure to pay the assessment within a period of thirty days after
the date of service of the citation tag, shall constitute a minor misdemeanor,
punishable as provided in subsection (g) hereof. Assessments may also be
charged as a lien against the property in question to the extent permitted by
law.
   (g)    Penalty. Violation of any provision of this Code or any amendment or
supplement thereto or failure to comply with any of the requirements of this
Code shall constitute a misdemeanor. Upon conviction, any person, firm, or
corporation shall be punished as provided in Section
 1341.99. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.
(Ord. 22-24. Passed 12-2-24.)
1341.14 PLACARDING.
   (a)   Placarding of Structure. After a condemnation notice required under
the provisions of this Code has resulted in an order by virtue of failure to
comply within the time given, the Code Official may post on the premises or
structure or parts thereof, or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the
words: "Condemned as unfit for human occupancy or use," and, a statement of the
penalties provided for any occupancy or for removing the placard. The owner or

(Ord. 10-87. Passed 4-6-87.)
1341.15 EMERGENCY ORDERS.
   (a)   General. Whenever a Code Official finds that an emergency exists on
any premises, or in any structure or part thereof, or on any defective
equipment which requires immediate action to protect the public's health and
safety or that of the occupants thereof, he may, with proper notice and service
in accord with the provisions of Section
1341.13, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and

1341.17 DEMOLITION.
   (a)   General. The Code Official may order the owner(s) of any premises upon
which is located any structure or part thereof, which in a duly authorized Code
Official's judgment is so old, dilapidated, or has become so out of repair so
as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use such that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, to raze
and remove such structure or part thereof; or if it can be made safe by
repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary, or to raze and remove at the
option of the owner(s); or, where there has been a cessation of normal
construction of any structure for a period of more than two years, to raze and
remove such structure or part thereof.
   (b)   Unreasonable Repairs. Whenever the Code Official determines that the
cost of such repairs would exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the current
value of such structure, based upon the county auditor's tax valuation of the
property or as determined by a qualified real estate appraiser, such repairs
shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the purpose of this
section that such structure is a public nuisance which may be ordered razed
without option on the part of the owner to repair. If a property owner
disagrees with a Code Official's determination that it would be unreasonable to
repair the property, the owner may appeal the Code Official's determination
pursuant to subsection (d) below.
   (c)   Order. The order, which shall be in writing and posted by a Code
Official in a conspicuous place on the property, shall include a description of
the real estate sufficient for identification; shall specify a reasonable time
in which the owner(s) shall comply with the corrective action required; shall
specify the reason the order was issued and the repairs and corrective action
required; and shall notify the owner(s), all holders of legal or equitable
liens of record, and other interested parties of the right to appeal the Code
Official's order within fifteen (15) days of service of the order.
   (d)   Service of the order. The order shall be served by certified mail on
the owner(s) of record; the owner(s) agent, if an agent is in charge of the
building; and upon the holder of any legal or equitable liens of record as
determined by the City Attorney after title review. If certified mail service
of the order is noted by the U.S. Postal Service as refused or unclaimed, the
order shall be sent via regular mail evidenced by a Certificate of Mailing from

   (a)   Any person or persons proposing to develop or redevelop land (for any
of the uses listed above) as defined under Section
1371.01(9) and (51) shall design and implement a site grading and drainage
development plan which will:
      (1)   Yield quantities of surfacewater runoff from the development site
at rates which are the same as or less that those before development occurred
and result in rates of gross erosion as specified by Section
1371.03.
      (2)   Not result in increasing current potentials for sedimentation of
lands, siltration of waters, and flooding of watercourses that are at lower
elevations off-site.
   (b)   No changes subject to regulation under this section shall be made in
the existing natural surface composition or subsurface configuration of any
land proposed for development or redevelopment within the City (for land uses
specified under Section
1371.03(a) without prior written approval of a site development plan by City
Engineer. Approval of a site development plan required according to Section
1371.05 shall not be given:
      (1)   Unless a determination is made by the City Engineer that
implementation of an approved site grading and drainage development plan would
not cause runoff, erosion, and sediment impacts that would be harmful or
damaging to the lands and waters off-site, or,
      (2)   Until a plan for minimizing the harmful and damaging potentials of
runoff, erosion and sediment impacts anticipated to result from implementation
of a proposed site grading and drainage development plan has been approved by
the City Engineer.
   (c)   Development situations may exist such that the development will have
none of the harmful effects associated with increased runoff rates and volumes
or sediment disposition. Such developments are eligible for a waiver from these
standards; however, the waiver applies only to the following requirements and
may have specific conditions attached by the City Engineer, including but not
limited to:
      (1)   The preparation of plans, maps, and/or information specified in
Section
1371.06.
      (2)   The installation of sediment abatement control devices until such
time as site inspection indicates they may be necessary.
      (3)   Controlling runoff to predevelopment conditions as specified in
Section
1371.03, except that stormwater runoff must be controlled to the maximum volume
and minimum rate feasible for the site as determined by the City Engineer.
   (d)   The request for a waiver shall be in writing and shall include
sufficient detail to determine that granting a waiver will not be detrimental
to abutting properties or to the drainage system. However, the waiver does not
in any way imply a relaxation of any of the other standards in this regulation
including the requirement for adequate on-site drainage, the ability to accept
runoff from land tributary to the development or reasonable control of soil
erosion and sediment.
   Development activities for which waivers may be considered include the
following:
      (1)   Single family residential developments involving improvement of an
individual lot in a previously approved subdivision.
      (2)   Multi-family residential, commercial, or industrial developments
which total two (2) acres or less.
      (3)   Modification to, or redevelopment of, an existing development which
will not result in additional impervious areas.
      (4)   Additions of 250 sq. ft. or more to existing property, such as
driveways, sidewalks, patios, etc.)
      (5)   Modifications to existing development that is less than 70% of the
cost of existing development.
      (6)   Regular farming procedures on land designed for such use.
   (e)   Development activities that are exempt from this ordinance include the
following:
   Additions of less than 250 sq. ft. to existing property such as driveways,

1371.03 STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL STANDARDS.
   (a)   In general, drainage systems shall be designed according to City of
Trotwood’s accepted design practice, sound engineering judgment and conform to
the following:
      (1)   Storm Sewer design shall be sufficient to convey the design storm
discharge (Q) with an average recurrence interval of 10 years so that the pipe
flowing full condition (hydraulic grade line at top of pipe) is not extended.
      (2)   Lot grading, in-tract drainage, and street improvements for all
subdivisions should be designed so that floods having an average recurrence
interval of 100 years or less will not cause inundation or damage to any
dwellings. A grading plan for each subdivision will be required to define the
lot grading and in-tract drainage. All developments within areas of special
flood hazard or delineated on the official National Flood Insurance Program
Flood Insurance Rate maps, or as determined by the City, shall comply with FEMA
design requirements.
      (3)   All drainage channels, conduits, and other structures located
outside the road right-of-way designed to convey public storm runoff (off-site
runoff) should be contained in suitable public easements. Easements for open
channels should include sufficient area along the channel banks to permit
access for maintenance equipment. Open channels may be fenced along both sides
through urban areas fenced along both sides through urban areas where necessary
to protect the public as well as preventing encroachment upon needed access
area.
   (b)   Areas adjacent to open drainageways and ponds shall be graded to
preclude the entrance of stormwater except at planned locations. Where
retention/detention areas are located on the project periphery, the developer
may be required to provide additional landscaping or screening to adequately
protect abutting properties.
   (c)   Each development shall provide for the on-site or off-site detention
of excess stormwater runoff resulting from that development. For the purpose of
this standard, “excess stormwater runoff” shall include all increases in
stormwater peak flows and volume resulting from: an increase in the imprevious
surface of the site, including all additions of buildings, roads, and parking
lots; changes in soil absorption caused by compaction during development;
modifications in contours, including the filling or draining of small
depressional areas, alterations of drainageways, or regrading of slopes;
destruction of forest; alteration of drainageways or installation of collection
systems to intercept street flows or to replace swales or other drainageways;
or the alteration of subsurface flows, including any groundwater dewatering or
diversion practices such as curtain drains, compared with the site in its
natural state.
   (d)   Any foreseeable increase in rates and volume of site surface drainage
water runoff caused by site development shall be controlled so the post-
development peak rate of runoff does not exceed that of the predevelopment one-
year frequency and the critical storm frequency as determined below. A
recommended method which may be used to determine changes in rates and volumes
of runoff is presented in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Engineering
Division of Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55, (Washington, DC: USDA, (January, 1975)
June, 1986 and the Ohio Supplement (April, 1981). To find the critical storm
frequency for which additional control will be needed:
      (1)   Determine the percent increase in runoff volume for a one-year
frequency, 24-hour storm; and
      (2)   Determine the critical storm frequency for which additional control
is needed by using the percent increase in runoff volume, derived in subsection
(a)(1) hereof, in the table below:
 
         % Increase in Runoff Volume from a    Critical Storm
         1-Year Frequency, 24-Hour Storm    Frequency
         Equal to or   Less Than
         Greater Than
         %          %      Years
         --10      1
         10      20      2
         20      50      5
         50      100      10
         100      250      25
         250      500      50
         500      --      100
   (e)   (The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the
development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a 1-year frequency
storm occurring over the same area under predevelopment conditions.) Storms of
less frequent occurrence (longer return period) than the critical storm, shall
have peak under predevelopment conditions. As an example, if the total volume
is shown to be increased by 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year storm. The peak
rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be controlled so as
not to exceed the peak rate of runoff from a 1-year frequency storm under
predevelopment conditions in the area. The runoff from a more intense storm
need only be controlled so as not to exceed the predevelopment peak rate from
the same frequency of storm.
   (f)   The intent of subsections (d) and (e) hereof will be met if the
criteria are fulfilled for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storm.
   (g)   Design regulations: All detention facilities and improvements required
by this section shall comply with the following regulations.
      (1)   An access easement shall be provided to all detention facilities
from the nearest public road so that these facilities are accessible in case
emergency maintenance work is required. The minimum easement width will be 10
feet.
      (2)   Storage Volumes: Storage may be provided by (set) wet or dry bottom
basins or reservoirs (or rooftop storage facilities).
      (3)   Maximum Depth: The maximum planned depth of stormwater (stored)
detained should be five (5) feet unless site conditions lend themselves to
greater depths.
      (4)   Outlet Control Structures: Outlet Control Structures shall be
designed as simply as possible and shall operate automatically. They will be
designed to limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or
conduits so as not to exceed the existing flow from the site in its natural
condition or as further controlled in subsection (d) hereof.
      (5)   Spillway: Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided unless
inflow is controlled to divert flows when the basin is at capacity. The
spillway shall safely discharge the detention basin overflow without damage to
the detention basin. A minimum of one (1) foot freeboard shall be provided for
the 100-year 24-hour storm event.
      (6)   Dry Bottom Basin: For basins designed without permanent pools:
         A.   Interior Drainage: Provisions must be made to facilitate interior
drainage, to include the provision of natural grades to outlet structures,
longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities, or the
installation of subsurface drains.
         B.   Multipurpose Features: These may be designed to serve secondary
purposes for recreation, open space, or other types of use which will not be
adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding.
         C.   Cleaning:   The basins shall be designed for periodic cleaning
and removal of sediments, which shall be removed from the site or otherwise
disposed of in an appropriate manner.
      (7)   Wet Basins: For basins designed with permanent pools:
         A.   Depth for Fish: If fish are used to help keep the basin clean, at
least one-quarter (25%) of the area of the permanent pool must have a minimum
depth of ten (10) feet.
         B.   Facilities for Emptying: For emergency purposes, cleaning, or
shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the
use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
         C.   Pollution Abatement: Aeration facilities may be required when the
quality of the influent and detention time would result in a lowering of
dissolved oxygen content in the basin.
         D.   Slopes: Approach slopes shall be at least 6:1 but not more than
3:1 and shall be at least four (4) to six (6) feet wide and slope gently toward
the basin. The side slopes shall be of nonerosive material with a slope of 1:
1 or flatter. The ledge shall be four (4) to six (6) feet wide and slope gently
toward the shore to prevent people or objects from sliding into deep water.
There shall be a freeboard of twelve (12) to eighteen (18) inches above the
high-water elevation on all retention basins. Alternate designs for side slopes
may be considered under special circumstances where good engineering practice
is demonstrated.
         E.   Cleaning: The basins shall be designed to include sediment traps
in all inlets. Sediment traps shall be designed to permit periodic cleaning and
maintenance. A basin maintenance plan shall be developed to insure that the
design depths of the basin will remain over time.
      (8)   Building Regulations:
         A.   Rooftop Storage: The depth and volume of storage, design of
outlet devices and downdrains, elevations of overflow scuppers, design loadings
for the roof structure, and emergency overflow provisions. (Rooftop storage
shall not be permitted to drain directly into sanitary sewers or streets.)
         B.   Parking Lot Storage: Paved parking lots may be designed to
provide temporary detention storage of stormwater on a portion of their
surfaces. Outlets shall be designed to empty the stored waters slowly, and
depths of storage must be limited so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles,
and storage areas shall be posted with warning signs.
         C.   Detention Storage: All or a portion of the detention storage may
also be provided in underground detention facilities, provided they meet the
design regulations of subsection (g)(2), (3) and (7)C. hereof.
         D.   Off-Site easements for stormwater management facilities will be
required when either of the following conditions exist:
            1.   The discharge is into any man-made facility for which the City
does not have either a drainage easement or right of way.
            2.   The discharge is into a natural system such that the rate or
character (i.e., sheetflow vs. concentrated flow) of the flow at the property
line has been changed. The easement will be required to a point at which
natural conditions are duplicated.
         E.   Design Criteria for Off-Site Drainage: Off-Site areas which drain
to or across a site proposed for development must be accommodated in the
stormwater management plans for the development. The stormwater management
system for the development must be capable of transporting existing off-site
flows through or around the development without increasing stages or flows
upstream or downstream of the development. The estimation of the off-site flows
must be done separately from the estimation of on-site pre- and post-
development flows (i.e., separate off-site and on-site hydrographs must be
computed due to the typically significant differences in land use
characteristics).
         F.   For sites containing less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet
of total impervious surface, alternatives to detention or retention ponds that
utilize landscaped buffers and swale drainage as a means of attenuating rate of
runoff are encouraged, provided it can be shown that applicable design and
performance criteria are met.
         G.   Measures shall be taken to protect the embankment of detention
and retention facilities from erosion and provide a definitive protective flow
path downstream of the facility.
            (Ord. 26-03. Passed 11-17-03.)
1371.04 OFF-SITE DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (a)   The City may allow or require surface water runoff to be discharged
into drainage facilities off the site of development if each of the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The drainage facilities are constructed and maintained in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Adequate provision is made for acquisition, construction and
operating costs of the off-site drainage facilities.
      (3)   A request to use these drainage facilities and all information
related to these proposed drainage facilities should be made a part of the
developer’s application.
   (b)   The City may allow or require payment of a fee for redevelopment
activities in lieu of constructing a detention or retention facility as
specified in Section
1371.03. Payment received in lieu of redevelopment detention or retention shall
be used for stormwater improvement projects, including the establishment of
regional detention systems. The fee shall be based on an amount per square foot
of impervious surface (on-site).
   (c)   Whenever deemed practical, necessary and in the public interest, the
City may acquire land and construct these drainage facilities, and to the
greatest extent possible, the fees and charges for such facilities be
sufficient to cover all costs associated therewith, and that such facilities be
self-supporting.
(Ord. 26-03. Passed 11-17-03.)
1371.05 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL STANDARDS.
   (a)   In order to prevent both solid erosion and sedimentation, a soil
erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required whenever a development
will involve any clearing, grading, transporting, or other form of disturbing
land by the movement of earth.
   (b)   Sediment deposition caused by accelerated stormwater runoff over a
development site or by accelerated erosion due to the sloughing or sliding of
surface soil that has been exposed by grading, dumping, stockpiling or any
other excavation-related earth disturbances shall be retarded (whenever
possible) and confined to within the boundaries of the development site.
   (c)   The accumulative monthly predicted amounts of gross soil loss
anticipated from sheet and rill erosion shall be abated to within an average
annual rate of fifteen (15) tons per acre during the first year, ten (10) tons
per acre for any year thereafter of site development activities and to within
five (5) tons per acre per year after site development is completed. The
Universal Soil Loss Equation as referenced within the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Water Management and Sediment
Control for Urbanizing Areas, (Washington, DC; U.S. Government Printing Office,
June, 1978) or other approved methods shall be used to predict average annual
rates of gross soil loss by month from a development site.
   (d)   Specifically, the following protection shall be provided for all
disturbed areas: minimize velocities of water runoff, maximize protection of
disturbed areas from stormwater runoff, and retain sedimentation within the
development site as early as possible following disturbances. A list of major
problem areas for erosion and sedimentation control follows. For each one, the
purpose(s) of requiring control is described. Soil erosion and sedimentation
control measures for all such areas shall be provided with a view toward
achieving the specific purpose listed below for which a control plan is
required:
      (1)   Erodable Slopes: Prevent detachment and transportation of soil
particles from slope.
      (2)   Streams, stream beds, stream banks, bodies of water, lake
shorelines: prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles.
      (3)   Drainageways: prevent detachment and transportation of soil
particles (which would otherwise deposit in streams, bodies of water, of
wetlands); promote deposit of sediment loads (traversing these areas) before
these reach bodies of water.
      (4)   Land adjacent to streams, ponds, lakes, and wetlands: prevent
detachment and transportation of soil particles.
      (5)   Enclosed drainage structure: prevent sedimentation in structure,
erosion at outfall of system, and deposit of sediment loads within system or
beyond it.
      (6)   Large flat surface areas (unpaved): prevent detachment of soil
particles and their off-site transportation.
      (7)   (Impervious) Pervious Surfaces: prevent the detachment and
transportation of soil (in response to an increase in the rate and/or volume of
runoff of the site or its concentration caused by impervious surfaces).
      (8)   Borrow and Stockpile Areas: divert runoff from the face of slopes
which are exposed in the excavation process; convey runoff in stabilized
channels to stable disposal points; leave borrow areas and stockpiles in stable
condition.
      (9)   Adjacent Properties: prevent their erosion and/or being deposited
with sediment.
   (e)   The Appendix presents graphic examples of erosion and sedimentation
control measures and indicates by asterisk, when any such measure may
effectively control the problem area. One or more of each such asterisked
measure shall suffice to comply with the requirements of this section.) (Ord.
26-03. Passed 11-17-03.)

               e.   That the Declaration of Covenants be in effect for at least
25 years with automatic renewal periods thereafter.
            5.   If the documents are not submitted with the original
application, they must be submitted and approved prior to construction. It is
advised that the documents be submitted prior to recording to allow comment by
the City Solicitor. Modification of these requirements can only be based upon:
               a.   Intervening local government requirements of a more
stringent nature such as the requirement of a maintenance agreement and posting
of bond by the developer.
               b.   The uniqueness of the project requiring an alternative
entity. Such alternative entity must be evaluated upon an individual basis with
any and all necessary agreements or easements in effect before approval will be
given.

1381.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
   (b)   The City of Trotwood has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Trotwood as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Trotwood.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Montgomery County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated January 6,2005:
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for Montgomery County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas (39113CIND1A, 39113CIND2A, 39113CO128E, 39113CO129E, 39113CO133E,
39113CO134E, 39113CO136E, 39113CO137E, 39113CO138E, 39113CO139E, 39113CO141E,
39113CO142E, 39113CO144E, 39113CO226E and 39113CO227E, dated January 6,2005.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Trotwood as required by Section
1381.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 2400 Olive Road, Trotwood, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances/resolutions including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance/resolution, the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Trotwood, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 31-04.
Passed 12-6-04.)
1381.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:

base flood elevations are determined.
      F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
         Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood lnsurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus [X] feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
more than an allowable rise as delineated in the Flood Insurance Study. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State or Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Trotwood whose historic preservation program has been certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Trotwood Flood
Insurance Rate Map, December 18, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (27)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AI-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 31-04. Passed 12-6-04.)

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Trotwood flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1381.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data. 
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1381.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1), prepared in a format required
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
City of Trotwood, and may be submitted at anytime.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Trotwood have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Trotwood Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Trotwood
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Trotwood suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Trotwood has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shan be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1381.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1381.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of City of Trotwood and the

actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 ( one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1381.04(i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Trotwood specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1381.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 31-04. Passed 12-6-04.)
1381.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Mayor and Council of City of Trotwood shall appoint an Appeals
Board consisting of the residents of the City of Trotwood. The members shall
serve 4 year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by
the Mayor and Council of the City of Trotwood. Each member shall serve until
his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
2400 Olive Rd., Trotwood Ohio, 45426.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) of these
regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee of $100 set in the schedule of fees adopted by the
City of Trotwood.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.   
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter be issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within
a reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Montgomery Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 31-04. Passed 12-6-
04.)
1381.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1381.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and be punishable
in accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
