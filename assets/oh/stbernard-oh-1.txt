ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 30, 1996
TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF ST. BERNARD,
OHIO; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO INCLUDE THE ENACTMENT OF
NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of St. Bernard, Ohio, has reviewed the
matter of recodification and general revision of the ordinances; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification; and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council; now therefore
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ST. BERNARD, OHIO
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of St. Bernard, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of St.
Bernard, Ohio, 1996.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of St. Bernard, Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to May 1, 1996, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right of liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or in action of
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect any indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to May 1, 1996.
   Section 3. That pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23 and 731.25, the Clerk of
Council shall post copies of this Ordinance in the public places provided by
Section
123.01 of the Codified Ordinances. Except for the Traffic and General Offenses
Codes previously adopted by Ordinance 24, 1995, all sections of the Codified
Ordinances without a previous ordinance history at the end thereof indicates
that the section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance. A
copy of the Codified Ordinances is on file for public examination at the City
Hall.
   Section 4. This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and
safety. The reason for the emergency is that there exists an imperative need
for the earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the
officials and residents of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily
operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Therefore, this
Ordinance shall take effect immediately by and upon its passage, and the
approval of two-thirds of the members of said Council. However, this Ordinance
shall take effect on the earliest date provided by law if approved by no more
than the majority of the members of Council and in that event the emergency
provisions herein are set at naught.
Passed this 6th day of June, 1996.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the St. Bernard Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history indicate
that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In
the following table, the disposition of all source material in the St. Bernard
Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

121.01 ATTENDANCE, ABSENCE FROM MEETING, AND VACATION OF COUNCIL SEAT.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.45, Council members are required to attend Council
and Committee of the Whole meetings and act in conformance with the rules of
Council. A reduction in salary shall be made for any member of Council who
fails to attend regular meetings of Council, including Committee of the Whole
meetings. Regardless of excuse, a Council member who misses two (2) consecutive
regularly scheduled meetings shall have their monthly salary reduced by one-
third if that Council member misses the next regularly scheduled meeting.
Regardless of excuse, any Council member who misses more than four (4) regular
meetings during a Council year (December 1st to November 30th) shall have their
monthly salary reduced by one-third for each additional regular meeting missed.
   Two-thirds of the members elected to Council may excuse any member from
attendance at any regular or special meeting. A Council seat of a member may be
declared vacant when the member has been absent from meetings for four (4)
consecutive meetings without a valid excuse or after ten (10) consecutive
meetings regardless of excuse deemed valid by a majority of Council. To declare
a Council seat vacant requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
members of Council. Under this procedure, the accused member of Council must be
given notice and an opportunity to answer charges, which are brought against
the member.

135.01 INVESTMENT AND DEPOSITORY POLICY.
   (a)   There is hereby established a the St. Bernard Investment Advisory
Committee. This committee shall consist of the following officials: Mayor, Law
Director, Treasurer and Auditor.
   (b)   The following “St. Bernard Investment and Depository Policy” is hereby
adopted as follows:
The St. Bernard Investment and Depository Policy is designed to cover all
monies under the control of the Village of St. Bernard and those monies and
funds that comprise the core investment portfolio. The Investing Authority of
St. Bernard shall reside with the Treasurer, subject to approval and direction
of the St. Bernard Investment Advisory Committee. Notwithstanding the policies
detailed below, Chapter 135 of the Ohio Revised Code will be adhered to at all
times by the Investing Authority and the Investment Advisory Committee.
      (1)   Objectives and guidelines. The following investment objectives will
be applied in the management of St. Bernard’s funds:
         A.   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and
protection of principal while earning investment interest.
         B.   In investing public funds, the Treasurer will strive to achieve a
fair and safe average rate of return on the investment portfolio over the
course of budgetary and economic cycles taking into account state law, safety
considerations and cash flow requirements.
         C.   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the Treasurer to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
         D.   The investments portfolio should be diversified in order to avoid
incurring potential losses regarding individual securities which may not be
held to maturity, whether by erosion of market value or change in market
conditions.
         E.   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
         F.   Bank account relationships will be managed in order to secure
adequate services while minimizing costs. Deposits should be concentrated in
single accounts except where audit control considerations dictate otherwise.
      (2)   Authorized financial institutions and dealers. U.S. Treasury and
Agency securities purchased outright shall be purchased only through financial
institutions located within the State of Ohio or through “primary securities
dealers” as designated by the Federal Reserve Board.
         A.   Repurchase Agreements shall be transacted only through banks
located within the State of Ohio with which the Treasurer has signed a Master
Repurchase Agreement as required in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
         B.   Certificates of Deposit shall be transacted through commercial
banks or savings and loans with FDIC or FSLIC coverage which are located within
the State of Ohio and qualify as eligible financial institutions under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 135.
         C.   A list of authorized institutions and dealers shall be maintained
with the investing authority. Additions and deletions to this list shall be
made when deemed in the best interest of the investing authority.
      (3)   Maturity. To the extent possible, the Treasurer will attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
to a specific cash flow requirement, the Treasurer will not directly invest in
securities maturing more than up to five years from the date of purchase.
      (4)   Derivatives. Investments derivatives and in stripped principal or
interest obligations of eligible obligations are strictly prohibited. A
derivative means a financial instrument or contract or obligation whose value
or return is based upon or linked to another asset or index, or both, separate
from the financial instrument, contract, or obligation itself. Additionally,
any security, obligation, trust account or instrument that is created from an
obligation of a federal agency or instrumentality or is created from both is
considered a derivative instrument.
      (5)   Allowable investments. The Treasurer may invest in any instrument
or security authorized in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 as amended. A copy of the
appropriate Ohio R.C. section will be kept with this policy.
      (6)   Collateral. All deposits shall be collateralized pursuant to Ohio
R.C. Chapter 135.
      (7)   Reporting. The investing authority shall establish and maintain an
inventory of all obligations and securities acquired by the investing
authority. The inventory shall include the description of the security, type,
cost, par value, maturity date, settlement date, and coupon rate. The investing
authority shall produce a monthly portfolio report detailing the current
inventory of all obligations and securities, and all transactions during the
month, income received and investment expenses paid, and the names of any
persons effecting transactions on behalf of the investment authority.
      (8)   Committee Meetings.  
         A.   The investment advisory committee will meet at least once every
quarter to review the portfolio in terms of security, type, risk and investment
return. The Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining records of all
investments and deposits and preparing reports that summarize recent market
conditions, economic conditions, economic developments and anticipated
investments for the investment advisory committee meeting.
         B.   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, all brokers, dealers, and
financial institutions initiating transactions with the investment authority by
giving advice or making investment policy, or executing transactions initiated
by the investment authority, must acknowledge their agreement to abide by the
investment policy’s content by signing a copy of this Investment and Depository
Policy (as attached). Such agreement shall be kept on file by the Treasurer of
this policy.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.    Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex ref. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

or other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the
Internal Revenue Code;
                  (ii)   The previous sub-section [Section
 181.03(a)(10)B.1.d.(i)] does not apply to the extent the income or gain is
income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250 of the Internal Revenue Code.
               e.   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a
deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
               f.   In the case of a real estate investment trust and regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
               g.   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation and is not an
individual, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income as if
the taxpayer were a C corporation, except;
                  (i)   Guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense; and
                  (ii)   Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to an owner or owner-employee of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for an owner or owner
employee, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for an owner or
owner-employee shall not be allowed as a deduction.
            2.   Nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
            3.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting or
removing the ability of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and
enforce the provisions of its municipal income tax.
         C.   Gross Receipts:
            1.   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to income in
the form of commissions, fees, directors' fees, sub-pay, profit sharing from
nonqualified plans, rentals from real and tangible personal property, and other
compensation for work or services performed or rendered as well as income from
sales of stock in trade.
            2.   Gross receipts shall include ordinary income as determined on
federal Form 4797
         D.   Expenses:
            1.   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business,
including reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed but no
deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or of the
partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise.
            2.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere
in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction
for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or
casually, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise of property used in the
trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the federal income tax.
Provided, however, that loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of
depreciable property or real estate, used in the taxpayer's business shall not
be allowed as a deductible expense.
            3.   Current amortization of emergency facilities under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if recognized as such for federal
income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction.
            4.   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed, only the
cost of demolition and the un-depreciated balance will be allowed as an expense
in the year of such demolition, to the extent allowable for federal income tax
purposes.
            5.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Tax
Commissioner (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable addition to the
reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount
allowable for federal income tax purposes.
            6.   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be claimed
as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not subject to
the tax, then taxes imposed on and other expenses of said property are not
deductible. In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
(1) the tax under this Chapter; (2) federal or other taxes based upon income;
(3) gift, estate, or inheritance taxes; and (4) taxes for local benefit or
improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof, and (5)
self-employment taxes for unincorporated businesses or other entities,
including credit for employment taxes as allowed for federal tax purposes.
            7.   If the taxpayer reports income that is non-taxable under this
Chapter and such amounts are deducted in order to reconcile the Municipal
return with the taxpayer's federal income tax return, expenses attributable to
this non-taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction from the remaining
taxable income.
The expenses attributable to such non-taxable income shall be deemed to equal
five percent (5%) of such non-taxable income. Non-taxable income given capital
gain treatment on the federal return, from which attributable expenses were
already deducted, is not subject to this subsection.
            8.   An employee who is paid on a commission or other compensation
basis and who pays his business expense from his commissions or other
compensation, without reimbursement from his employer, may deduct from his
gross commissions or other compensations, business expenses allowed as a
deduction by the Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes but
only to the extent said expenses are incurred in earning commissions or other
compensations subject to the tax imposed by this Chapter.
Business expenses allowed shall be those expenses allowed to be claimed on the
federal Form 2106 and upon the request of the Tax Commissioner, verifiable with
supporting schedules and/or receipts.
No expenses claimed on federal Form "Schedule A, Itemized Deductions" shall be
allowed.
Failure to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon request by the

            9.   Expenses incurred while attending educational courses may not
be deducted from wages.
            10.   Moving expenses included in gross earnings shall be an
allowance as a deductible expense. No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer

moving deductions. Only moving expenses incurred, as part of income included in
gross earnings, will be allowed.
            11.   No deduction shall be allowed for self-employed health
insurance against income as allowed for federal or state tax purposes for
unincorporated entities or the like.
            12.   401(k), IRA, SEP, KEOGH plans or any other type of deferred
compensation plans shall not be allowed as a deduction against income for
unincorporated entities or the like as allowed for federal purposes.
      (11)   Royalties:
         A.   Income in the form of royalties is taxable if taxpayer's
activities produced the publication or other product, the sale of which
produces the royalties.
   
   (b)   Apportionment of Business Profits for Business Both In and Outside the
Municipality: This Section does not apply to taxpayers that are subject to and
required to file reports under Chapter 5745, of the Ohio Revised Code. Except
as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this Section, net profit from a
business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   Business Apportionment Percentage Method: Multiply the entire net
profits of the business by a business apportionment percentage to be determined
by the following steps:
         A.   STEP 1: Determine the percentage of average original cost of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession in such municipal corporation during the taxable period,
to the average original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same
period, wherever situated.
            1.   The original cost of real and tangible personal property
includes, property rented or leased, leasehold improvements, and all real and
tangible personal property owned or used in the business.
            2.   The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal
property within the Municipality is determined by dividing the original cost of
such property within (without deduction of any encumbrances) by the original
cost of all such property within and without the Municipality. In determining
such percentage, property rented to the taxpayer as well as real and tangible
personal property owned by taxpayer must be considered.
               a.   The original cost of real and tangible personal property
rented by tax payer shall be determined by multiplying gross annual rents by
eight (8).
               b.   Gross rents mean the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and include:
                  (i)   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real
and tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a
fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales profits or otherwise;
                  (ii)   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of
rent such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other amounts required to
be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
               c.   A residence may not be considered an office unless a
separate portion of the structure such as a room or basement is used
exclusively for business purposes.
         B.   STEP 2: Determine the percentage of the total salaries, wages and
other compensation paid during the taxable period to persons employed in the
business or profession for services performed within the Municipality compared
to the total salaries, wages and other compensation paid during the same period
to persons employed in the business or profession, within and without the
Municipality, wherever their services are performed, excluding compensation
that is not taxable by the municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
            1.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other compensation, subject to Municipal income tax, paid owners or
credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the
return are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other compensation, subject to Municipal income tax, shall be computed on
the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in
the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within
and without the Municipality, the amount treated as compensation for service
performed within the Municipality shall be deemed to be:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to
his efforts within the Municipality.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which
the value of his services within the Municipality bears to the value of all his
services; and
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the Municipality is of his total working time.
               d.   Provided, however, all employees regularly connected with
or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the
Municipality who performs 75% or more of their services within the Municipality
shall be considered employees within the Municipality.
            4.   Non-resident professional persons shall use the factor of days
spent within the Municipality to total working days. All employees regularly
connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer
outside the Municipality who performs 25% or less of their services within the
Municipality shall be considered employees outside the Municipality. (The
provisions of this sub section are not applicable in determining the tax
liability of a non-resident who works in and outside the Municipality.)
         C.   STEP 3: Determine the percentage of gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales made and services performed during the
taxable period in the Municipality compared to gross receipts of the business
or profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever made or
performed.
            1.   The following sales shall be considered Municipal sales:
               a.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
Municipality to purchasers within or without the Municipality except such of
said sales to purchasers outside the Municipality that are directly
attributable to regular solicitations made outside the Municipality personally
by taxpayer's employees.
               b.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Municipality if shipped or delivered from an office,
store, warehouse, factory, or place of storage located within the Municipality.
               c.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Municipality even though transported from a point outside
the Municipality if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Municipality and the sale
is directly or indirectly the result of such solicitation.
               d.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the Municipality
to purchasers outside the Municipality if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place of delivery.
               e.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
            2.   In the application of the foregoing sub-sections, a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller, regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial.
            3.   Solicitation of customers outside the Municipality by mail or
phone from an office, or place of business within the Municipality shall not be
considered a solicitation of sales outside the Municipality.
         D.   STEP 4: Add the percentages determined in accordance with the
first three STEPS above, or such percentages as may be applicable to the
particular taxpayer's business, and divide the total by the number of
percentages used in ascertaining the total. The result is the business
apportionment percentage.
            1.   In determining the average percentage, a factor shall not be
excluded from the computation merely because the factor is found to be
apportioned entirely in or outside the Municipality.
            2.   A factor is excluded only when it does not exist anywhere.
            3.   Provided, however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the formula provided for, the Tax Commissioner,
upon application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other
factors or methods calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment.
         E.   STEP 5: The business apportionment percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits apportioned to the Municipality.
      (2)   Substitute Method:
         A.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under
the business apportionment percentage formula, the Tax Commissioner, upon
application of the taxpayer may substitute other factors in the business
apportionment percentage formula or prescribe other methods of apportioning net
income calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment.
         B.   Application to the Tax Commissioner to substitute other factors
in the business apportionment percentage formula or to use a different method
to apportion net profits must be made in writing before the end of the tax year
and shall state specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or use of
a different method is requested and the relief sought to be obtained. A copy
thereof shall be served at the time of filing upon the taxpayer or Tax
Commissioner as the case may be. No specific form need be followed in making
such application. Once a taxpayer has filed a return based upon a substitute
method, he must continue to so file based upon that same method until given
permission to change by the Tax Commissioner.
         C.   The decision of the Tax Commissioner on subsections (2)A. and B.
above may be appealed by the taxpayer to the Board of Review, which shall have
the power to adjust, modify or overrule such decision of the Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Professional and Personal Service:  In the case of professional
people and others furnishing personal services, if their only place of business
is within the Municipality, all their net profits shall prima facie be
attributable to the Municipality.
      (4)   Resident Sales Apportionment Percentage Less Than One Hundred
Percent:
         A.   All resident corporations, unincorporated businesses, or other
entities whose principal place of business is within the Municipality, shall be
considered a resident Municipal business and be subject to the following
provision:
         B.   If the sales apportionment percentage is less than one hundred
percent (100%), a statement shall be submitted with the return indicating: (1)
other municipalities to which sales are apportioned; (2) percentage of sales
apportioned to each municipality; (3) whether or not a return was filed and tax
paid on the sales apportioned to each municipality. Failure to submit this
statement (or when the statement indicates no other municipal tax was filed and
paid), shall result in all sales being considered as sales of the Municipality.
   (c)   As used in subsection (b) of this Section, "Sales Made In a Municipal
Corporation" mean:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation, if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within
such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal corporation
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this Section, net
profit from rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be
subject to tax only by reason of their location within the Municipality where
the property generating the net profit is located.
   (e)   This Section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by
residents of the Municipality to the extent allowed by the United States
Constitution.
   (f)   Net Operating Loss (NOL):
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year,
apportioned to the Municipality, may be applied against the portion of the
profit of succeeding tax years, apportioned to the Municipality, until
exhausted, but in no event for more than five (5) taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred.
      (2)   No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against
net profits of any prior year.
      (3)   In the event net profits are apportioned both within and without
the Municipality, the portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be
allocated to the Municipality in the same manner as provided for apportioning
net profits to the Municipality. The portion of a net operating loss to be
carried forward shall be determined in the year the net operating loss is
sustained utilizing the basis of the apportionment factors applicable to that
year.
      (4)   The same method of accounting and apportionment must be used in the
year to which an operating loss is carried as was used in the year in which the
operating loss was sustained.
      (5)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
      (6)   A short fiscal year (a fiscal year of less than twelve (12) months)
brought about by a change in accounting period, a new taxpayer selecting a
short fiscal year, or a taxpayer operating in the Municipality for less than a
full accounting period, shall be considered as a full taxable fiscal year for
purposes of loss carry-forward.
      (7)   In any return in which a net operating loss deduction is claimed, a
schedule should be attached showing:
         A.   Year in which net operating loss was sustained.
         B.   Method of accounting and apportionment used to determine the
portion of net operating loss apportioned to the Municipality.
         C.   Amount of net operating loss used as a deduction in prior years.
         D.   Amount of net operating loss claimed as a deduction in the
current year.
      (8)   With respect to a return combining taxable income from two or more
sources, the following rules shall be applied:
         A.   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession are
not deductible from employee earnings but may be carried forward as set forth
in this section.
         B.   If a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business
activities to be included in the same return., the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another taxing municipality) may be used to
offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
      (9)   Loss from an unincorporated business subject to income tax from
another municipal taxing authority.
      A.   A loss from the operation of a business or profession maybe offset
against net profits from other business or professional activities in the
amount of the loss commensurate with the portion of profits, if profits
existed, with respect to which credit could not be claimed for tax paid to
another municipality.
Accordingly, if the profits of an activity are subject to tax by another
municipality, the portion of a loss that may be used to offset profits is
determined by calculating the difference in the tax rates, expressed as a
percentage to the Municipality's current tax rate, and multiplying that
percentage by the current year loss.
For example, if a business is located in another municipality with a tax rate
of 1.5% with a loss of $10,000. The loss allowable against the Municipality
business income is $2857. (ie. 2.1% - 1.5% = .6%, then .6% divided by 2.1% =
.2857, then $10,000 x .2857 = $2857) The remaining loss is only allowable
against the other taxing authority.
      (10)   Losses from the operation of a farm, determined in accordance with
accounting methods used by taxpayer for federal income tax purposes, shall be
allowable as an offset to net profit as set forth herein.
   (g)   Consolidated Returns:
      (1)   Consolidated returns may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year, the
consolidated group must continue to file consolidated returns in subsequent
years unless:
         A.   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Commissioner to file
separate returns.
         B.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.
         C.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group into
another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.
   (h)   Exceptions: The provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following and shall not be considered taxable:
      (1)   Proceeds from welfare benefits, unemployment insurance benefits,
supplemental unemployment benefits, pensions, Social Security benefits, or

personal services, other compensation, and other taxable income earned, net
profits of businesses, professions or other activities subject to the tax,
earned on and after January 1, 1966. (Ord. 58-2012. Passed 12-6-12.)
181.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Date and Requirement for Filing:
      (1)   On or before April 15th of each year, every person or taxpayer who
engages in business or other activity in the Municipality, or whose taxable
income is subject to the provisions of Section
181.03 of this Municipal Income Tax Code shall, except as provided in this
Chapter, make and file with the Tax Commissioner a Municipal tax return on a
form prescribed by and acceptable to the Tax Commissioner, whether or not a tax
is due.
      (2)   On or before April 15th of each year, every resident, who reached
the age eighteen (18) years of age or older during the taxable year, subject to
the provisions of Section
181.03, of this Municipal Income Tax Code shall, except as provided in this
Chapter, make and file with the Tax Commissioner a Municipal tax return on a
form prescribed by and acceptable to the Tax Commissioner, whether or not a tax
is due.
      (3)   When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or
period.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner is authorized to provide that the return of an
employer or employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said
employer or employers from the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options,
grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage
continuation plan and other compensation, and other taxable income of a
nonresident employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax Commissioner may be
accepted as the return required of a nonresident employee whose sole income,
subject to tax under this chapter, is such, qualifying wages, commissions,
other compensation, and other taxable income.
      (5)   The return shall be accompanied by payment of any taxes due.
      (6)   Every person subject to the provisions of Section
181.03 of the Tax Ordinance shall file a return setting forth the aggregate
amount of qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, other taxable
income, net profits from business or other activities, including the rental
from the use of real and personal property, distributive shares from
partnerships and other income taxable under this Chapter, received for the
period covered by the return and such other pertinent facts and information in
detail as the Tax Commissioner may require.
      (7)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (8)   An employee who is permitted to deduct business expenses from
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income,
must conform to federal income tax regulations and shall file a return in order
to claim such deductions even though all or part of such qualifying wages,
commissions, other compensation and other taxable income are subject to
withholding.
      (9)   Any taxpayer who received taxable income, not subject to
withholding under this Chapter, must file a return.
      (10)   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for which
a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business, is
required to file only one return.
      (11)   All tax imposed on the S Corporation, partnership or association
as an entity whether resident or non-resident and a return is required
disclosing the net profits apportioned to the Municipality and the tax paid.
However, any resident partner or shareholder of an unincorporated entity is
required to make a return and pay the tax in accordance with this Chapter.
      (12)   Executors and administrators are required to file return and are
liable for the payment of any taxes due by a deceased from an estate of said
deceased. Trustees are required to file returns on the trusts and are required
to give name and address of the beneficiaries, even though the later
individually pays the tax.
   (b)   Joint Returns:
      (1)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint
return for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither
taxable income nor deductions included on the municipal return, regardless of
whether their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a
joint municipal return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate
taxable income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and
several.
      (2)   A husband and wife may file a joint return either when engaged in
the same or separate businesses, but may not deduct business losses of either
from compensation paid by an employer.
   (c)   Returns, Information Required and Reconciliation with Federal Returns:
      (1)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner, or on
a generic form, and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with this Chapter. The return shall set forth:
         A.   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan and other compensation received, allocated, apportioned
or set aside, other income defined by statute as taxable and gross income from
any business, profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in
the acquisition of such gross income, earned during the preceding year and
subject to said tax; and,
         B.   The amount of the tax imposed by this Chapter on such earnings
and profits; and,
         C.   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this Chapter; and,
         D.   For all net-profits returns filed, there shall be set forth on
the return, the aggregate amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commission, fees and other compensation subject to the tax earned
from each employer, taxable net profits, and other pertinent information as the
Tax Commissioner may require.
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall accept a generic form of any return,
report, or document required to be filed if the generic form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with this Chapter
and the Rules and Regulations.
      (3)   Where figures of total income, total deductions, and net profits
are included, as shown by a federal return, any items of income which are not
subject to Municipal tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in
determining net income subject to Municipal tax. The fact that any taxpayer is
not required to file a federal tax return does not relieve him from filing a
Municipal tax return.
      (4)   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the Internal
Revenue Service, or by a judicial decision, results in an additional amount of
tax payable to the Municipality, a report of such change shall be filed by the
taxpayer within three (3) months after receipt of the final notice from the
Internal Revenue Service or final court decision.
      (5)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes owed and paid to the Municipality, a claim for refund shall be filed
with the Tax Commissioner as prescribed in Section
181.11 of this Chapter.
   (d)   Extensions:
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return by filing a copy of the taxpayer's federal extension request with
the St. Bernard Tax Department.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a St. Bernard Income Tax Return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension must be filed on or before the original
due date for the annual return.
      (4)   If the request is granted, the extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the last day of the month following the month to
which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or non-payment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a municipal income tax
return does not extend the due date as provided in this Section for payment of
the tax; hence penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the
period of extension at the rate set out by Section
 181.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period, provided all other
filing and payment requirements of this Chapter have been met.
      (7)   Any extension by the Tax Commissioner shall be granted upon the
condition that declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled;
however, if, upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration
filing and payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest
may be assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
   (e)   Payment with Returns:
      (1)   The taxpayer filing a tax return shall, at the time of the filing,
pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due. However, credit
shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the
source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06 hereof; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer, pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07 hereof; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
181.15 hereof, for tax paid to another municipality.
Such credits shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
181.05 of this Chapter, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Chapter, may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded.
      (3)   Taxes due or refunds of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be
collected or refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns:
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
181.11 and
181.15 of this Chapter. The Tax Commissioner shall provide by regulation the
format in which such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change
the method of accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for
filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's St. Bernard tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended St. Bernard return showing income subject to the
Municipality tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability,
and pay any additional tax shown due or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (g)   Information Returns:
      (1)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns.
      (2)   Failure to file such information returns, schedules and statements
shall be a violation of this Chapter.
      (3)   The taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after notification by the Tax
Commissioner, or his authorized representative, to file the items required by
this paragraph.
         (Ord. 58-2012. Passed 12-6-12.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Duty of Withholding and Payment of Tax Withheld by Employer:
      (1)   It is the duty of each employer within, or doing business within
the Municipality who employs one or more persons, whether as an employee,
officer, director or otherwise, on a salary, wage, commission or other personal
service compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage, commission or
other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside, the tax at the
rate provided in Section
 181.03 hereof on those qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation due by such employer to such employee and shall, on
or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following such withholding,
make a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted.
The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax
Commissioner and shall be subject to this Chapter and any Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   Effective January 1, 2006, employers shall make the payment of
withheld taxes to the Tax Commissioner by electronic funds transfer. The Tax
Commissioner shall adopt rules governing the payment of withheld taxes by
electronic funds transfer as required by this Chapter. The rules shall govern
the modes of electronic funds transfer and under what circumstances each mode
is acceptable, the content and format of electronic funds transfer, the
coordination of payment by electronic funds transfer and filing of associated
tax reports and returns, and any other matter that facilitates payment by
electronic funds transfer.
      (3)   Upon written request of a taxpayer, the Tax Commissioner may
implement means of acknowledging receipt of payments made by electronic funds
transfer and may adopt rules governing acknowledgments. The taxpayer requesting
acknowledgment shall pay the cost of acknowledging receipt of electronic
remittances. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld. Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on
a basis greater than qualifying wages.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner shall have the authority to grant to employers
with three or less resident employees, permission for said employees to file
individually.
      (5)   The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
         A.   The gross amount of all qualifying wages, salaries, including
sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements,
stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan, fees, commissions or other forms of
compensation allocated, set aside or paid to residents of the Municipality,
regardless of the place where the services are rendered; and
         B.   The gross amount of all qualifying wages, salaries, including
sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements,
stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan, fees, commissions or other forms of
compensation allocated, set aside or paid non-residents for services rendered,
work performed or other activities engaged in within the Municipality.
         C.   An employer is liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and with held, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
      (6)   All employers within or doing business within the Municipality are
required to make the collections and deductions specified in this section,
regardless of the fact that the services on account of which any particular
deduction is required, as to residents of the Municipality, were performed
outside the Municipality.
      (7)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the Municipality, but who are subject to tax on net profits
attributable to the Municipality under the method of the business apportionment
percentage formula provided for in this Chapter, are considered to be employers
within the Municipality and subject to the requirements of withholding.
      (8)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation paid. If the employer has withheld the tax and failed to pay the
tax withheld to the Tax Commissioner, the employee is not liable for the tax so
withheld.
      (9)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payor, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax pursuant to the
provisions of this Chapter.
      (10)   Where a non-resident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the Municipality, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the Municipality in accordance with
the following rules of apportionment:
         A.   If an employer is located within the Municipality, all non-
resident employees who report to the Municipal location are taxable to the
Municipality unless the employer is withholding tax for other taxing
municipalities where the employee's work is performed.
         B.   If the non-resident is a salesperson, agent or other employee
whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or
chiefly effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the
portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or
chiefly effected by the employee within the Municipality bears the total volume
of business transacted by him within and outside the Municipality.
         C.   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
other non-resident employees, including officers of corporations, shall attach
to the proportion of the personal service compensation of such employee which
the total number of his working hours within the Municipality is of the total
number of working hours.
         D.   The fact that non-resident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the apportionment of pay for time worked within the
Municipality on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in
the Municipality will be computed on the basis of a forty-hour week unless the
employer notifies the Tax Commissioner that a greater or less number of hours
are worked.
            1.   The determination of tax liability of non-residents working in
and out of the corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the total
number of days worked in the municipality divided by the total number of days
worked during the year, and the resulting percentage applied to the total
annual income from wages including sick leave and vacation pay. Where no record
can be substantiated of the number of days worked, the figure 260 is to be used
as the total number of days worked.
         E.   Wages of itinerant ministers, pastors, or preachers are not
subject to withholding.
         F.   Wage continuation plans paid by the employer or third party agent
on behalf of the employer for purpose of health, recuperation or other reward
are deemed to have the same tax situs as the primary job assignment or job
location of the employee and are taxable on the same ratio as the normal
earnings of such employee for this primary job assignment.
      (11)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (12)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to
an employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be
withheld, ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided such expenses are incurred in earning compensation,
including commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the
employee under this Chapter.
      (13)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a non-resident
of the Municipality and has no knowledge to the contrary, shall be relieved of
the responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid
to such employee for services rendered or work done outside the Municipality by
such employee, provided, however, that such employer must withhold the tax on
all personal service compensation paid such employee after the Tax Commissioner
notifies said employer in writing that such employee is a resident of the
Municipality. All employees are required to notify the employer of any change
of residence and the date thereof.
      (14)   An employer shall not be required to withhold the St. Bernard tax
from the qualifying wages earned by a resident the Municipality for work done
or services performed in another municipality which imposes a tax upon such
qualifying wages of such St. Bernard resident if such employer withholds the
tax on such resident's qualifying wages for such other municipality. Where such
municipal tax is for a smaller amount than the tax imposed by this Chapter, the
employer shall furnish the Commissioner with a list of St. Bernard resident
employees from whom such lesser tax is withheld, and the employer shall
withhold and remit the difference to the Municipality.
      (15)   The Tax Commissioner shall have authority to enter into agreement
with other taxing municipalities permitting an employer to withhold the entire
tax on the wages of a floater either for the taxing municipality in which the
employer has his principal place of business or the taxing municipality in
which the employee resides.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
month, payments shall be made quarterly on or before the day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Commissioner.
   The Tax Commissioner may grant an exemption to an employer from the duty to
make payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer upon application
for such exemption by the employer and the employer's demonstration to the Tax
Commissioner that the requirement to make payment of withheld taxes by
electronic funds transfer will impose a hardship upon the employer.
   The Tax Commissioner may revoke either approval granted in this section
whenever the Tax Commissioner has reason to believe that the conditions for
granting such authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not
met, or when it is in the best interest of the Municipality to do so. Notice of
withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case; the employer must begin
to file in accordance with this Section.
   (e)   Frequency of Payments: Where taxes withheld equal or exceed two
hundred dollars ($200.00) per month, payments will be made monthly by the 15th
day of the month following the end of each month. All other employers will
remit quarterly the amounts withheld.
   (f)   Personal Liability for Collection and Payment of Tax:  
      (1)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from salaries and wages
shall pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of
this Section. In the event taxes withheld from employees are not paid to the
Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers,
members, managers, employees and trustees having control or supervision of, or
charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment, are
jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the
Municipality, as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also
liable under the provisions of Section
 181.12 of this Chapter.
      (2)   The dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company or business trust to file returns or pay
said taxes.
   (g)   Withholding Return; List of Employees:  
      (1)   Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation showing
the sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of which, (if
any) was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for same, and the
portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the amount of such
withholdings remitted. Such return shall include, Form W-2 for each employee or
list of employees containing W-2 information concerning each employee from whom
the municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year, and the amount of municipal tax withheld.
If the total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted
to another municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the
return of information to the Municipality concerning each employee.
The withholding tax reconciliation, Form W-3, shall be filed by each employer
on or before February 28th following the end of such calendar year.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by this
Chapter is withheld from the employee's pay, the excess shall be refunded by
the employer to the employee. If less than the amount of tax required to be
deducted is deducted and withheld by the employer in any pay period or pay
periods, the deficiency shall be deducted in subsequent pay periods.
   (h)   Form 1099 Reporting:
      (1)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed, shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28th following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   Employer Deemed Trustee:
      (1)   Every employer, in collecting and holding the tax required to be
withheld under this Chapter, is deemed to be a trustee for the benefit of the
Municipality and the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be
trust funds, until the funds are paid to the Municipality.
      (2)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Municipality for payment of such tax whether
actually collected from such employee or not.
   (j)   Domestic Servants:    No person shall be required to withhold the tax
on the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable
income paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
   (k)   Fractional Parts of a Cent: In deducting and withholding the tax at
the source and in payment of any tax due under this Chapter, a fractional part
of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half (1/2¢) cent or
more in which case it shall be increased to one cent (1¢).
   (l)   Winnings. Any business, profession or other enterprise located in St.
Bernard which sponsors, creates, or allows play, gaming, wagering, sweepstakes,
or games of chance or activities which result in winnings, as defined in this
Chapter, and the winnings are an amount for which reporting to the internal
revenue service of the amount is required by section 6041 of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended, the business, profession or enterprise operating such
activity shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's
winnings at the rate of the tax imposed by this Chapter. Amounts withheld shall
be remitted to the St. Bernard Tax Department within 30 days.
      (1)   The requirements in this section requiring the immediate
withholding and remittance of taxes to the St. Bernard Tax Department shall not
apply to any non-profit, religious, charitable, or educational organizations
that operate a fund raising raffle, game of chance, or sweepstakes.
      (2)   Each such business, profession or other enterprise or activity
shall make and file a yearly information return by February 28th on a form
furnished by the St. Bernard Tax Department, detailing the amount of tax
deducted from a person's winnings and prize awards and paid to the St. Bernard
Tax Department in accordance with this Chapter.
         (Ord. 02-2014. Passed 1-2-14.)
181.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement for Filing:   
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not
subject to Section
181.06 hereof, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or
activity resulting in income subject to the tax imposed by Section
181.03(a) in this Chapter, shall file a declaration setting forth such
estimated income or the estimated profit or loss from such business activity,
together with the estimated tax due thereon, if any. Provided, however, if a
person's income is wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be
withheld and remitted to this Municipality in accordance with Sections
181.06,
181.03(a), and
181.15 of this Chapter, such person need not file a declaration.
      (2)   A taxpayer's final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax for the current year. In
the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a return, a
declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed in good
faith.
   (b)   Dates for Filing:
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each
year during the life of this Chapter, or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day
of the fourth (4th) month following the date the taxpayer becomes subject to
tax for the first time.
      (2)   Those taxpayers having a fiscal year or period differing from the
calendar year shall file a declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of
the fourth (4th) month following the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Forms -- Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Community:
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner, or on an acceptable generic form, and
credit shall be taken for the municipal tax to be withheld from any portion of
such income. In accordance with the provisions of Section
181.07(c) and
 181.15 hereof, a credit may be taken for tax to be withheld and remitted to
another taxing municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for in this section.
      (3)   For taxpayers who are individuals, such declaration of estimated
tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least

current year's liability at taxpayers option. Where no election has been made

deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.       
         (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the receding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars. The payment under division (B)(1)(c) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than one of the following:
            (i)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section 182.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   Employers with fifty or more employees shall submit the Reconciliation
Return either electronically or by CD.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent
the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
      (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a
municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such

year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
182.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
182.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such

      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax

returns required under this section.

182.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a fairer apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria in (a), (b), or (c). For taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2018, gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria (a) or (b).
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
Criteria (c) applies to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018 and is
not applicable for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   (1)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

corporation based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
municipal corporation to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of

182.063 ALTERNATIVE APPORTIONMENT FOR BUSINESSES WITH REMOTE WORKERS.
   (A)    Terms used in this section have the same meanings as in Section
182.062 of this Code.
   (B)    A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this section to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of Section
 182.062 of this Code apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this section by notifying
the tax administrator in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return
or, if applicable, a timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed
appeal of an assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which
that return, or appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the
taxpayer revokes the election. After the taxpayer makes the initial election,
the election applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer
conducts business.
   Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election
under this section after properly revoking a prior election.
   (C)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of Section
 182.062 of this Code, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (B) of this section:
      (1)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of Section
182.062 of this Code, the average original cost of any tangible personal
property used by a qualifying remote employee or owner at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (2)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of Section
182.062 of this Code, any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services
performed at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused
to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (3)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of Section
182.062 of this Code, and notwithstanding division (D) of that section, any
gross receipts of the business or profession from services performed during the
taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
   (D)    Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or the
tax commissioner from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of Section
 182.062 of this Code. However, the commissioner shall not require an
alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would cause a
taxpayer to incur tax liability in a municipal corporation solely because a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located in that municipal corporation.
   (E)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section
is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages pursuant to
Section
182.051 of this Code.

      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.83 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the Municipal Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

      (3)   A refund must be claimed by the taxpayer or his employer within
three (3) years of the date of filing the final return for the year for which
such refund is claimed. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe rules for
verification.

authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a St. Bernard
resident or his employer is paying the tax shall be considered as fulfilling
the requirement of this section.
(Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
182.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident.
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact

agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for     the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
      (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person. (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
   (F)   This division is not subject to Ohio Revised Code Sections 718.80 to

182.097 for election to be subject to Revised Code Sections 718.80 to 718.95.
(Ord. 10-2018. Passed 2-1-18.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)   The extended due date of the municipal income tax return for a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.

or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
      (1)    If a tax administrator violates division (G) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars.
   Division (G) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer
failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension
under this section or failed to file for an extension under division (C) of
this section. (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15; Ord. 38-2023. Passed 11-29-23.)

return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including

undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the

      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or

      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the

      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts

obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,

      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event

(Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
182.09 of the this Code fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner/Administrator may make
an assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which
the return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The Tax Commissioner/Administrator shall not make or issue an assessment
against a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return
subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was
filed. Such a time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the
Commissioner/Administrator consent in writing to the extension. Any such
extension shall extend the three-year time limit in section 718.91 of the
Revised Code for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
 182.09 of the St. Bernard tax code or section 718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio
Revised Code, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner/Administrator
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the Commissioner/
Administrator shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment
and request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner/
Administrator within sixty days after service of the notice of assessment,
either personally or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment
signed by the authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the
facts, the assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due
and payable from the taxpayer to the City of St. Bernard. The petition shall
indicate the taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in
writing if received by the Commissioner/Administrator prior to the date shown
on the final determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the
commissioner/administrator shall proceed under Section
182.18 of this code. (ORC 5703.60)
   (C)    If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47
of the Ohio Revised Code from the day the Commissioner/Administrator issues the
assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the
attorney general for collection under section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code,
whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to
the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the
assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section
5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date of certification until the date
it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the
tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
      (1)    The attorney general may assess collection costs as authorized
under section 109.08, 109.081, or 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code on amounts
collected under this section, which shall be credited to the attorney general
claims fund created under section 109.081 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (E)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15; Ord. 38-
2023. Passed 11-29-23.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.

   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 52-2015. Passed 12-10-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

191.01 NECESSITY.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the Village, slum,
blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this
chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimicable
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents
thereof; that the existence of such areas:
   (a)    Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime, and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection, and for other public services
and facilities;
   (b)    Constitutes an economic and social liability; and
   (c)    Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community;
retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems,
and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities;
and that this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise of the police power, and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided; that the elimination in whole or in part of slum, blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas, and the prevention of occurrence or
recurrence of such areas by redevelopment and by the conservation,
rehabilitation and reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of the salvageable
portions of such areas, and by other activities pursuant to urban redevelopment
or urban renewal as defined herein, are public uses and purposes for which
public money may be expended and private property acquired by purchase, by
donation and by eminent domain and are governmental functions of concern to the
Village, and require the exercise of the powers of government granted to the
Village by the provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution and that
the necessity in the public interest and general welfare, for the provisions of
this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.02 POLICY.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of Council to promote and encourage
the sound development, including renewal and redevelopment where necessary, of
the entire Village in accordance with the General Plan for the Village. Council
realizes that the Village government will be unable to carry out coordinated
and effective programs for renewing the Village without the cooperation and
support of the public as a whole. Therefore, Council stands ready to cooperate
with private enterprise, civic groups, neighborhood agencies and governmental
agencies in developing and carrying out urban renewal programs and projects to
promote the sound development of new areas, to prevent the spread of slums and
blight and to eliminate slums, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas
in the Village.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings ascribed
to them in this section unless a different meaning is clearly indicated in the
context.
   (a)    "Agency" or "urban renewal agency" or "local public agency" or
"Village" means the Village of St. Bernard, Ohio.
   (b)    "Slum, blighted or deteriorated area" means an area within the
corporate limits of the Village in which there are a majority of structures or
other improvements, which, by reason of dilapidation, deterioration, age or
obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation or
open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary
conditions or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by
fire or other hazards and causes, or any combination of such factors, and an
area with overcrowding or improper location of structures on the land,
excessive dwelling unit density, detrimental land uses or conditions, unsafe,
congested, poorly designed streets or inadequate public facilities or
utilities, all of which substantially impair the sound growth and planning of
the community, is conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant
mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime, and is detrimental to the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (c)    "Deteriorating area" means either: (1) An area, whether predominately
built up or open, which is not a slum, blighted or deteriorated area but which,
because of incompatible land uses, nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking
facilities, faulty street arrangements, obsolete platting, inadequate community
and public utilities, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, increased
density of population without commensurate increases in new residential
buildings and community facilities, high turnover in residential or commercial
occupancy, lack of maintenance and repair of buildings, or any combination
thereof, is detrimental to the public health safety, morals and general
welfare, and which will deteriorate, or is in danger of deteriorating, into a
slum, blighted or deteriorated area, or (2) An area consisting principally of
land in highways, railway or subway tracks, bridge or tunnel entrances, or
other similar facilities which have a blighting influence on the surrounding
area and over which air right sites can be developed, thereby eliminating such
blighting influence.
   (d)    "Project area" or "urban redevelopment area" or "urban renewal area"
means a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area or any combination
or part thereof which Council designates as of a character and size appropriate
for urban renewal activities and for which an urban redevelopment plan or urban
renewal plan is proposed or prepared.
   (e)    "General neighborhood renewal area" means an urban renewal area
together with any adjoining areas having specially related problems of such
scope that urban renewal activities therein have to be initiated in more than
one separate urban renewal project, over an estimated period of up to eight
years.
   (f)    "Urban renewal" or "urban redevelopment" means the activities of the
Village, with or without Federal or State aid or assistance for developing,
undertaking and carrying out of urban renewal or redevelopment programs and
projects, including all planning and other related activities of the Village in
connection therewith, or any part of such activities.
   (g)    "Open space land" means land which has not been developed by the
construction or installation of streets, utilities, buildings (except sporadic
or incidental structures) or other site improvements. Whether or not such an
area has been platted in whole or in part does not prevent its classification
as "open space land".

neighborhood renewal area. The general neighborhood renewal plan need not
contain all of the required contents set forth in Section 191.06 with respect
to an urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan. Approval of the general
neighborhood renewal plan by Council does not create authority to carry out
project execution activities.
   (k)    "Urban renewal project" or "urban redevelopment project" or "project"
means undertakings and activities of the Village, with or without Federal or
State aid or assistance, in a project area for the elimination and for the

area, or rehabilitation and conservation in a project area, or any combination
or part thereof, in accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment
plan for the project area to the full extent of and in accordance with the

deterioration, or to provide land for needed public facilities; and disposition
of property, so acquired in accordance with this paragraph (6) for voluntary
repair and rehabilitation of buildings or other improvements in accordance with

or urban redevelopment plan.
      (8)    Acquisition and repair or rehabilitation for guidance purposes,

repaired or rehabilitated for dwelling use or related facilities, provided that
there shall not be acquired for such purposes, in any project area, buildings,
which contain or will contain more than 100 dwelling units, or five percent of
the total number of dwelling units in such area which under the urban renewal
plan are to be repaired or rehabilitated, whichever is the lesser.
      (9)    Relocating within the project area a structure which the Village

paragraph (9).
   (l)    "General plan" or "master plan" generally means a broad and general
guide and pattern for the future growth and development of the Village,

(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.07 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    When a general neighborhood renewal plan or an urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan and the supporting documentation therefor is filed with

Plan of the Village, by causing a copy of the plan and supporting documentation
to be delivered to the person charged with the preparation and custody of the
record of proceedings of the Planning Commission.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval or recommendations concerning the plan. The approval of the Commission
shall also constitute its approval of those matters placed under its
jurisdiction by Ohio R.C. 713.02, except as the recommendations of the Planning
Commission may include a disapproval pursuant to that section. Except as
recommendations or disapprovals are received from the Planning Commission on or
before the thirtieth day after the day of delivery to the person charged with
the preparation and custody of the record of proceedings of the Planning
Commission of the plan and supporting documentation, the plan shall be
conclusively presumed to have been approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.08 PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)    Council, before approving a general neighborhood renewal plan or an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, shall hold a public hearing on the
plan at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons interested to be
heard either in person or by counsel, which hearing may be adjourned from time
to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village once a week for two
consecutive weeks on the same day of the week, and at least seven full days
shall elapse between the second publication and the date set for the public
hearing. The notice shall also contain a description of the project area by its
location in relation to highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or
artificial boundaries, and shall also designate the place at which the plan,
maps, plats and other materials describing the project area are and will be
available for public inspection.
   (b)    Following the completion of the public hearing, Council may either
approve or reject the general neighborhood renewal plan or the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan, or make modifications and approve the plan as
modified; provided that, if
      (1)    The boundaries of the project area are extended to include any
land, except land contained within the right-of-way lines of a dedicated street
or alley, not included in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon
which the public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, or if
there is added a type of urban renewal or redevelopment activity not included
in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing
was held pursuant to subsection (a) which requires the acquisition of property
or if there is any change deemed by Council to be substantial in land use or
redevelopment restrictions contained in the urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing was held pursuant to
subsection (a), a public hearing shall be held on the urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan as modified prior to the approval thereof by Council in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (a); and
      (2)    Such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the general neighborhood renewal
plan or urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan as modified and shall be
resubmitted to the Planning Commission for its written approval or
recommendations pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07.
   (c)    When Council wishes to approve a general neighborhood renewal plan,
or an urban renewal or redevelopment plan, it shall do so by ordinance passed
by not less than a majority vote, after reading in full on three separate days
or under suspension of rules pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.17; provided, however,
if such plan has not been approved by the Planning Commission, or if there were
any partial disapprovals by or adverse recommendations of the Planning
Commission under Ohio R.C. 713.02 not accepted by Council by its modifications
of the plan in accordance therewith, then an affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the members of Council shall be required to pass such ordinance and, to the
extent that such disapproval involves the construction of an improvement or
utility within the meaning of Ohio R.C. 713.02, the concurrence of the head of
the department or departments having control of the construction of such
proposed improvement or utility shall also be necessary.
   (d)    The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal
plan should contain a finding that the plan conforms to the General Plan and to
the workable program of the Village and such other findings as may be necessary
or desirable, but need not contain the other findings set forth below in
subsection (e) for approval of urban renewal or redevelopment plans. Such
approval of a general neighborhood renewal plan may be made before or at the
same time as the approval of the urban renewal or redevelopment plan for a
project within the general neighborhood renewal area.
   (e)    The ordinance of Council approving an urban renewal or redevelopment
plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)    Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area
which make it a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, and
findings that the project area is a slum, blighted, deteriorated or
deteriorating area.
      (2)    That the size and character of the area and the location of
elements of slum, blight and deterioration in the area make it appropriate for
urban renewal activities .
      (3)    That the proposals for the proper relocation of individuals and
families displaced in carrying out the project in decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings in conformity with acceptable standards are feasible and can be
reasonably and timely effected to permit the proper prosecution and completion
of the project; and that such dwellings or dwelling units available or to be
made available to such displaced individuals and families are at least equal in
number to the number of displaced individuals and families, are not generally
less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities than the dwellings of the displaced individuals and families in the
project area, are available at rents or prices within the financial means of
the displaced individuals and families, and are reasonably accessible to their
places of employment.
      (4)    This finding is made only if Federal aid is needed: that financial
aid to be provided by the Federal government under its contract is necessary to
enable the project to be undertaken in accordance with the plan.
      (5)    That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise.
      (6)    That the plan conforms to the existing General or Master Plan for
the overall development of the Village as prepared by the Planning Commission
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 713.02.
      (7)    That the plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities, as may be desirable for
neighborhood improvement, with special consideration for the health, safety and
welfare of the children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by
the plan.
      (8)    This finding is made only if there is included in the plan any
provision permitting the new construction of hotels, motels or other housing
for transient use: that the Village has caused to be made a competent
independent analysis of the local supply of transient housing and as a result
thereof determines that there exists in the project area a need for additional
units of such housing.
      (9)    This finding is made only if the project area is not predominantly
residential in character and is not to be redeveloped for predominantly
residential use: That the redevelopment of the project area for predominantly
nonresidential uses is necessary for the proper development of the community.
      (10)    This finding is to be made only where an open space land program
is involved: that the land and the interests in land to be acquired are for the
purpose of preserving such area as open space land and are necessary to orderly
long range development, to curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban blight and
deterioration, to encourage more economical and desirable urban development and
to provide areas for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation areas,
watersheds, and to preserve natural resources, and that the area to be so
acquired is of a size and character appropriate for such purpose.
      (11)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
clearance is the sole treatment proposed: that the objectives of the urban
renewal plan cannot be achieved through rehabilitation of the urban renewal
area.
      (12)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
both clearance and rehabilitation treatment are proposed: that the objectives
of the urban renewal plan cannot be achieved through more extensive
rehabilitation of the urban area.
      (13)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved: that
the United States of America and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
are assured of full compliance by the Village with regulations of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development effectuating Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
      (14)    This finding is to be made only where an educational institution
or a hospital is located in or near the project area and it is desired to
utilize Section 112 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended: that, in addition
to the elimination of slums and blight from such area, the undertaking of an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment project in the area will further promote
the public welfare and the proper development of the community:
         A.    By making land in the area available for disposition, for uses
in accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, to such
educational institution or hospital for redevelopment in accordance with the
uses specified in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan;
         B.    By providing, through the redevelopment of the area in
accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, a cohesive
neighborhood environment compatible with the functions and needs of such
educational institution or hospital; or
         C.    By any combination of the foregoing.
      (15)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved:
consideration has been given to development of a sewer system to serve the
urban renewal area which will to the maximum extent feasible, provide for
effective control of storm and sanitary wastes.
   (f)    The Clerk of Council shall certify as true and correct and deliver to
the Mayor a copy of the aforesaid ordinance of Council approving the plan for
his approval or veto, and appropriate further action, and any documents which
were submitted to Council to support findings made in the ordinance should be
filed with a copy of the ordinance.
   (g)    The taking effect of the ordinance approving an urban renewal or
redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the Village
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
Federal government, the State of Ohio, any entity, instrumentality or
subdivision of either, or from any other entity or person for such purpose.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.09 FEDERAL AID CONTRACTS.
   Any contract with a Federal agency for loans, advances, grants or other
Federal aid to the Village shall be approved by the Solicitor as to form and
legality and after approval and authorization by ordinance of Council, passed
in accordance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 731.17, shall be executed by
the Board of Control.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)

(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.11 EXECUTION OF PROJECTS.
   (a)    Acquisition of Property. As authorized by Council and with the
approval of the Board of Control where appropriate under the provisions of Ohio
R.C. 733.22, the Director of Public Service and Safety with the appropriate
advice and assistance of the Solicitor, shall cause the necessary steps to be
taken to acquire the parcels of land in the project area in accordance with the
urban renewal or redevelopment plan, including but not limited to, the
negotiation for such parcels, obtaining appraisals, title examinations and
reports, executing contracts for any of such services and appropriate documents
to transfer title to the Village; provided that in the event appropriation of
property is necessary, Council shall initiate and carry out, with the
appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees, boards and
commissions of the Village, the proceedings in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 163. Acquisition may take place at any time after compliance with
Sections
191.07 and
191.08.
   (b)    Preparing Property for Disposition. After any necessary
appropriations of Village moneys and authorization of expenditures by
ordinances of Council in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 5705, Council
action, where appropriate, to rezone property, vacate or dedicate streets or
other public places and provide for the establishment and preservation of open
space areas pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapters 711, 713 and 723, and applicable
Village ordinances; approvals and directions of the Board of Control, where
appropriate, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 733.22; certification of funds by the
Auditor, where appropriate, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5705.41; and preparation of
or approval of legal form of contracts by the Solicitor, the Director of Public
Service and Safety shall make the contracts, purchase the supplies and
materials and provide the labor, pursuant to and in accordance with the
applicable provisions, including the competitive bidding requirements, of Ohio
R.C. 735.05 to 735.09, 723.52 and 723.53, and Ohio R.C. Chapter 153, for such
Village activities as may be necessary to carry out the urban renewal project,
including but not limited to the demolition, rehabilitation or repair of
structures, whether voluntarily by the private owners thereof or by the Village
for demonstration purposes in limited numbers, the removal of pavement,
sidewalks, lighting and trees, capping, removal and relocation of Village-owned
utility lines, grading, construction of site improvements and supporting
facilities and the temporary lease, rental or permission to let others use
structures or parcels of land while owned by the Village, relocation activities
and the enforcement of any applicable provisions of law or conforming
agreements relative to building, zoning, platting and the repair or
rehabilitation of land and structures remaining in private ownership.
   (c)    Disposition of Property. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 721.01, 721.03 and
721.28, after its determination that real property is not needed for any
Municipal purpose, Council may authorize by ordinance the transfer, lease or
conveyance of any real property in accordance with and for the purposes of the
plan, subject to such lawful terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants,
including covenants running with the land, to assist in carrying out the
purposes of the plan. All dispositions of real property shall be at not less
than the fair value thereof determined by Council based upon the proposed new
uses and restrictions thereon to be imposed under the urban renewal plan by
Council through zoning ordinance; private covenant or otherwise. Such
determination shall be made only after obtaining independent appraisals of such
fair value upon the aforesaid bases, which appraisals shall not be binding upon
the Village. The manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and
may be by negotiation, with or without any
competitive bidding, and such competition and award of a disposition contract
may be based on factors other than price alone. Two weeks' publication of
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village shall be sufficient
notice for the taking of competitive bids or of the execution of a disposition
contract without competitive bidding. The financial and legal ability of those
proposing to acquire or lease such real property shall be considered in all
dispositions. The Director of Public Service and Safety shall execute, on
behalf of the Village, such instruments as may be necessary to transfer, lease
or convey such real property in the form approved by the Solicitor and
authorized by Council, which form shall include all covenants running with the
land, including any portions of the plan incorporated by reference. The
Director of Public Service and Safety shall execute any certificates of
completion of improvements or other appropriate instruments, on behalf of the
Village, that may be necessary in accordance with any covenants in such
instruments of lease or conveyance.
   (d)    Conforming Agreement with Owner. If the owner of property in the
project area is willing to make the use of his property conform to the urban
renewal or redevelopment plan and Council finds and determines that the
acquisition of the property by the Village will not be necessary if so
conformed, the Mayor, upon Council authorization, may enter into a conforming
agreement upon such terms and security as may be authorized by Council. Such
agreement may provide for the acquisition of property upon continued failure of
the property owner to keep his agreement after notice from the Village
specifying such failure.
   (e)    Agreements with Community Improvement Corporations. In the execution
of urban renewal or redevelopment projects, Council may authorize, as to any
appropriate projects or parts of projects, the employment of community
improvement corporations, community redevelopment corporations and metropolitan
housing authorities, as defined by the statutes of Ohio, and when authorized by
ordinance of Council may grant leases, make conveyances and enter into
agreements with such corporations related to appropriate aspects of such
projects to the full extent of the powers possessed by such corporations.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
191.12 FINANCES.

Village from appropriate general or special funds or accounts established
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapters 135 and 5705 and the Village may accept grants
or gifts of moneys or real or personal property from persons, entities,
governments or taxing authorities to be used for the planning and financing of
such urban renewal activities. Any investment of excess funds shall be carried
out in accordance with provisions of Ohio R.C. 731.56 to 731.59. All bonds or
notes payable from the general credit and taxes of the Village to finance the
urban renewal activities shall be issued in accordance with the applicable

carrying out of those urban renewal activities being financed by loans or
advances from the Federal government separate from any other Village accounts,
including Village accounts used to carry out any activities being financed by
the Village and no money or real or personal property shall in any way be
pledged as security for the repayment of any Federal loans or advances, except
the separately described portion of a project area set aside for such purpose,
together with the proceeds from the sale, lease or temporary operation thereof
and Federal capital grant moneys earned in connection therewith in order to
avoid violating statutory and constitutional debt and tax limitations.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.13 BUILDING PERMITS.
   After approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan by Council, no
building permit shall be issued for the improvement or enlargement of any
existing structure, or for the construction of a new structure, in the
clearance and redevelopment portion of the project area, except that such
permit may be issued for the repair of an existing structure when such repair
is deemed necessary by the Building Commissioner for the immediate preservation
of the public health and safety or is required by the redeveloper in accordance
with the redevelopment plan.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.14 TAX EXEMPTION.
   (a)    All property of the Village, including funds, owned or held by it for
the purposes of this chapter shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an
execution, and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the
same nor shall judgment against the Village be a charge or lien upon such
property; however, the provisions of this section shall not apply to or limit
the right of obligers to pursue any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge
or lien given pursuant to this chapter by the Village on its rents, fees,
grants or revenues from urban renewal or redevelopment projects.
 
   (b)    The property of the Village, acquired or held for the purposes of
this chapter on January 1 of any year, is declared to be public property used
exclusively for essential public and governmental purposes, and such property
shall be exempt from all taxes of the Village, County, State or any taxing
authority thereof, however, such tax exemption shall terminate when the Village
sells, leases or otherwise disposes of such property in a project area to a
purchaser or lessee which is not a person, corporation, partnership or other
association entitled to tax exemption with respect to such property.
(Ord. 30-1967. Passed 9-21-67.)
191.15 SEPARABILITY; CHAPTER CONTROLLING IN CONFLICT OF LAW.
   Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby
declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held
invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision to
persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall
not be affected thereby.
   Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall
be controlling. The powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and
supplemental to the powers conferred by other law.

192.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   (a)   By passage of Ordinance 37-1994, the Village hereby found and
determined that there existed within the Village of St. Bernard premises that
by reason of age, location, obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of
maintenance, lack of facilities, or lack of repair or combination thereof
constitute a blight and a nuisance upon these surrounding neighborhoods because
they are fire hazards, health hazards, substantial and unreasonable
interference with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises
in the neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating property values in the
area.
      (1)   It is further found that the parcels described in the St. Bernard
Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan of 1994 contained blighted premises.
      (2)   It is further found that the Village of St. Bernard acquired those
blighted premises by negotiated purchase for the purpose of eliminating blight.
      (3)   It is further found that the only effective way to have eliminated
the blight on the premises described in the Village of St. Bernard Scattered
Site Urban Renewal Plan was to acquire the property and demolish the buildings
thereon in order to clear them for redevelopment.
      (4)   It is further found that unless the properties described in the St.
Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan of 1994 were developed in accordance
with a comprehensive urban renewal plan there was a serious hazard to the
public that the blighted condition will recur and reappear in the neighborhoods
where the St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan contains parcels.
      (5)   It is further found that it was necessary to protect the public
health, safety and general welfare to dispose of the properties described in
the St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan of 1994 in accordance with
the urban renewal plan in order to avoid the recurrence of blight.
 
   (b)   (1)   The legislature for St. Bernard in this year of 2010 hereby
concur with the findings as set forth in subsection (a) hereof and re-affirm
the findings as set forth.
      (2)   It is hereby found that while many of the parcels of properties as
set forth in the St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan of 1994 have
been redeveloped, there still exist certain parcels of property, with the plan,
that are yet to be redeveloped.
 
   (c)   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Council amends the Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan
of 1994 to add additional property from time to time.)
(Ord. 05-2010. Passed 3-4-10.)
192.02 PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.
   The St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan as amended 2010 has been
reviewed, approved and recommended by the Planning Commission.

192.03 PLAN ADOPTION.
   In order to prevent the further recurrence of blight on the parcels
described in the St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan as amended 2010,
the St. Bernard Scattered Site urban Renewal Plan as amended 2010 is hereby
adopted as an official urban renewal plan for scattered sites described therein
pursuant to the authority as set forth in Ordinance No. 42, 1968.
(Ord. 05-2010. Passed 3-4-10.)
192.04 LAND DISPOSITION.
   The property described in the St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan
as amended 2010 shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the
St. Bernard Scattered Site Urban Renewal Plan as amended 2010 as authorized in
Section 8 of St. Bernard Ordinance No. 42, 1968.
(Ord. 05-2010. Passed 3-4-10.)

for the program's operation.
   (a)    Eligibility. 
      (1)    The amount of rent supplementation to be provided to a family or
individual shall equal the difference between the gross monthly rent of the
dwelling unit to which they have relocated and their ability to pay as defined
in subparagraph (3) hereof.
      (2)    The amount of rent supplementation to be provided to a family or
individual receiving public assistance where the rent allowance is inadequate
shall be the difference between the amount of the rent allowance and the gross
monthly rent of the dwelling unit to which they have relocation without
deduction from the welfare assistance of the amount of the rent
supplementation.
      (3)    The ability to pay shall be defined as twenty percent of the gross
monthly income of an individual or family.
         (Ord. 25-1968. Passed 6-6-68.)
      (4)    The amount of rent supplementation to be provided to a family or
individual as established by this subsection, shall be based on the gross
monthly rent paid by the individual or family provided that the amount of gross
monthly rent used to calculate the rent supplement shall not exceed those
rentals established on HUD Form 6148 "Schedule of Average Gross Rentals for
Standard Housing in Locality" as recommended by the Director of Building,
Development and Planning and approved by the Federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development .
         (Ord. 38-2014. Passed 9-4-14.)
   (b)    Duration of Assistance. Rent supplementation shall be provided to
each eligible family and individual for a period of five years from the date of
relocation, or:
      (1)    Until the economic condition of the family or individual improves
to such an extent that assistance is no longer necessary,
      (2)    The Village makes public housing or housing assistance under the
Federal rent supplement program available to the family or individual,
      (3)    The family or individual refuses to allow a quarterly re-review of
the ability to pay or a monthly review if this is deemed to be in the best
interest of the Village,
      (4)    The family or individual moves from the Village, or
      (5)    The family or individual refuses to accept a standard dwelling
unit adequate as to size, location and within their ability to pay.
         (Ord. 25-1968. Passed 6-6-68.)
   (c)    Administration. 
      (1)   Responsibility of administrating the rent supplementation program
shall be vested in the Building, Development and Planning Department or its
legal successor.
      (2)   Public funds shall be used for the rent supplementation payments
and shall be deposited in accordance with an escrow agreement approved by the
Village Solicitor with the local depository approved by the Village Treasurer.
      (3)   The amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) which is estimated to
be the first annual funding requirement shall be deposited initially and
additional deposits shall be made as needed until all eligible families and
individuals have been assisted to the extent to which they are entitled.
      (4)   The escrow agent will dispense funds to eligible families and
individuals as recommended by the Building, Development and Planning Department
or its legal successor, and approved by the Mayor, but will make no
determination with respect to the eligibility or amounts to be paid.

195.03 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The rent supplementation program will be in full effect as soon as
practicable after the date of a letter of consent to proceed with early
acquisition activities from the Federal government.

197.01 NECESSITY TO ACQUIRE BLIGHTED PROPERTY.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the Village
premises that by reason of age, location, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, lack of maintenance, lack of facilities, or lack of repair or a
combination thereof constitute a blight and a nuisance upon the surrounding
neighborhood because they are fire hazards, health hazards, substantial and
unreasonable interferences with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of
other premises in the neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating property
values in the area.
   It is further found that programs aimed at specific elimination of the
particular blights or nuisances involved in neighborhoods of the Village have
sometimes proved inadequate or ineffective, have sometimes failed to prevent
recurrence of the nuisance or blight, and have sometimes resulted merely in the
alteration of the nature or form of the nuisance or blight that previously
existed. It is further found that it therefore becomes necessary, in order to
eliminate nuisance and blight and prevent recurrence of blight, for the Village
to obtain the title of the blighted premises and to take direct action to
remove the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make further
provisions for future development, redevelopment or use of the premises in such
a way as to prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the premises.
   It is further found and determined that acquisition of such blighted
property by the Village in order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent
its recurrence constitutes a public purpose
(Ord. 42-1968. Passed 12-5-68.)
197.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings
ascribed to them unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the
context.
   (a)    "Blighted premises" means premises which because of their age,
location, obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance, lack
of facilities, or repair or any combination thereof constitute a serious fire
hazard, a serious health hazard, a substantial and unreasonable interference
with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises within the
neighborhood or a factor seriously depreciating property values in the
neighborhood.
   (b)    "Neighborhood" means an area of the Village comprised of all premises
or parcels of land which in whole or in part are located within a radius of 500
feet of any one parcel or lot within the Village.
   (c)    "Redevelopment" means the acquisition of blighted premises, the
demolition of a structure or structures thereon, the making of site
improvements, including the construction or reconstruction of structures
thereon, or the sale of property for use in accordance with the Zoning, Housing
and Building Codes of the Village. Redevelopment may include the construction
of improvements by the Village of any buildings for public use or for resale to
private persons.
   (d)    "Rehabilitation" means the restoration, rehabilitation or
conservation of blighted premises by improvement, modernization or repair of a
structure or structures thereon to bring it into conformance with applicable
Building, Housing and Zoning Codes of the Village.
      (Ord. 42-1968. Passed 12-5-68.)
197.03 DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES BY DIRECTOR OF BUILDING, DEVELOPMENT
AND PLANNING.
   The Director of Building, Development and Planning shall present to Council,
from time to time, a report which shall list therein the location and ownership
of premises which he has reason to believe are blighted premises as defined in
this chapter and which are located in the Village of urban renewal areas or
"blighted areas" as defined in Section
191.03. The report will state the factors which, in the Director of Building,
Development and Planning's opinion, would warrant the determination that the
premises so listed in the report are blighted. The premises so listed in the
report shall be only those blighted premises which, in the opinion of the
Director of Building, Development and Planning, are such that, in order to
eliminate the existing blight and to prevent future blight, acquisition thereof
will be necessary for one or more of the following reasons:
   (a)   The owner of the premises cannot or will not:
      (1)   Eliminate the blighted condition, and/or
      (2)   Prevent recurrence of blight, or
   (b)   The owner has not responded to a lawful order by the Village for him
to take action to eliminate its recurrence within thirty days after due notice
of the request or order has been given him by:
      (1)    Posting such order or notice on the premises;
      (2)   Personal delivery;
      (3)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner; or
      (4)   Publishing once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation, a notice of the issuance of the order relating to the
premises and directing the owner to contact the Building Commissioner in regard
to such order; and
   (c)   Direct action, short of acquisition by the Village to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)

the tag to the violator or by affixing it to the vehicle. The citation tag
shall direct the violator to appear and present the tag at a designated office
in the Village Hall at or before a date and hour specified thereon. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to abridge the power of a police officer to
arrest any violator and take him into custody.
   (b)   No person charged with violating any provision of this Traffic Code
shall present a citation tag or file a written plea of guilty with the Clerk of

303.13 AUTHORITY OF PROPERTY OWNER.
   Nothing in this Traffic Code shall be construed to prevent the owner of real
property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel by permission of
the owner and not as a matter of right, from prohibiting such use or from
requiring additional conditions to those specified in this Traffic Code, or
otherwise regulating such use as may seem best to the owner.

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a

by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima- facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving
under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

(A) of Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section. (ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00
Second degree             4000.00
Third degree                 3000.00
Fourth degree             2000.00
Minor                        1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

531.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. The word “shall” is

phrasing, any person who has not yet reached his or her eighteenth birthday.
   (b)   “Parent” means any person having legal custody of a minor:

   (c)   “Public street” means a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to
the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or
in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term “street”
includes the legal    right of way, including but not limited to the traffic
lanes, parking lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, any
grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right of way of a street.
The term “street” applies irrespective of whether the formal name is called
alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise.
   (d)   “Public place” means any parks, playground, parking lots, vacant lots,
land or buildings open to the public, or any property owned by the Village,
County, State or Federal government, any privately or public owned property
where a minor is present without consent.
   (e)   “Time” referred to herein is based upon prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally
observed at that hour by the public in St. Bernard.
      (Ord. 15-1992. Passed 4-2-92.)
531.02 VIOLATIONS; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Violation. No minor shall be in or upon any public street or public
place, during the period beginning 12:00 midnight and ending 5:00 a.m.
   (b)   Exceptions. In the following exceptional cases, a minor, who would be
found in violation of subsection (a) hereof, shall not be considered in
violation when any of the following apply:
      (1)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
      (2)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor
to take such parent’s place in accompanying the minor for a designated period
of time and purpose within a specified area.
      (3)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such
exercise by first delivering to the Police Department, a written communication,
signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor
with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the Police Chief,
specifying when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the public
streets or public place at night during hours when the curfew ordinance is
otherwise applicable to such minor, in the exercise of a First Amendment right
specified in such communication.
      (4)   In case of reasonable necessity but only after such minor’s parent
has communicated to the Police Department personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity and designating the minor’s proposed route, purpose and
the period of time the minor will be in or upon the public streets or public
place.
      (5)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
      (6)   When going to or returning home, by a direct route from and within
thirty minutes of the commencement or termination of a school activity, or an

Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station.
      (7)   When any minor traveling to or from a place of legitimate
employment.
      (8)   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through St. Bernard. This also exempts interstate
travel beginning or ending in St. Bernard.
         (Ord. 15-1992. Passed 4-2-92.)
531.03 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   No parent having legal custody shall knowingly permit or by inefficient
control allow, such minor to be in or on public street or public place under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of, this curfew ordinance. The term “knowingly” includes knowledge which a
parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a
minor in that parent’s legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep
neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard or
parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that
a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts
of such minor.
(Ord. 15-1992. Passed 4-2-92.)
531.04 POLICE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A police officer of the Village, upon finding or having attention
called to any minor on the streets in prima-facie violation of the curfew
ordinance, normally shall take the minor to the Village police station, where a
parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, and whereupon an
inquiry shall be made. This inquiry is intended to permit the officer to
ascertain, under constitutional safeguards, relevant facts and information to
perform his duties. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth
certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his
best judgment in determining age.
   (b)   A police officer may, under appropriate circumstances, order such
minor to return home or may deliver the minor to the custody of such parent,
where, for example, such minor is of a tender age, or where the identity and
address of such minor may readily be ascertained or are known.
   (c)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person which will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (d)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall
send to a parent written notice of such violation with a warning that any
subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance,
including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.
(Ord. 15-1992. Passed 4-2-92.)
531.05 SEVERABILITY.
   Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the curfew
ordinance. If any provision, including inter alia any exception, part, phrase
or term, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and the validity of the curfew ordinance in any and all other
respects shall not be affected thereby. It is intended that the curfew
ordinance be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application
would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall
be given. Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the State of
Ohio or the Constitution of the United States of America.
(Ord. 15-1992. Passed 4-2-92.)
531.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   If, after a parent has been warned and given notice of a first
violation by such minor, and such minor is found in violation again, this shall
be treated as a first offense by the parent. Such parent shall be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. For any subsequent offense, a parent shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (b)   Any minor who violates any provision of this chapter more than two
times shall be reported to the juvenile authorities for the treatment,
supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.

State or that it is not entitled to full faith and credit under 18 U.S.C. 2265
(c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

section.

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
 
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

Bernard Codified Ordinances, occurring on any residential or commercial
property located within the Village, and engaged in by an owner, occupant or
invitee of the owner or occupant of the property, are declared to be nuisance

   (b)   When four or more nuisance activities as defined in division (a) occur
on separate occasions on the same residential or commercial property within any
three hundred sixty-five (365) day period, the Director of Public Service and
Safety may declare the premises to be a nuisance property and may abate the
nuisance as provided in Section
 560.02.
(Ord. 20-2017. Passed 10-5-17; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
560.02 ACTION TO ABATE NUISANCES; COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Director of Public Service and
Safety, upon finding that four (4) or more nuisance activities as defined in
Section
560.01 have occurred on separate occasions within any three hundred sixty-five
(365) day period on the same residential or commercial property may cause a
written notice and order to be served on the owner of the property declaring
that the property is a nuisance property. This notice and order shall identify
the nuisance activities, and the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance
activity; shall state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of
abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as set forth
in division (d) of this Section; and shall state the appeal process. The notice
shall further state that if a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section
560.01 occurs later than thirteen (13) days after the date of the written
nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12) months of the date of the
fourth or any subsequent nuisance activity, the Village may abate the nuisance
by responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement
actions, and the costs of the abatement shall be charged to the owner of the
nuisance property and may be certified as a lien on the nuisance property.
Notice shall be deemed properly delivered by delivering it personally to the
owner or leaving it at the owner's usual place of business or residence, or by
mailing it to the owner, or, if it cannot be served in any of the other ways
mentioned above, by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation
within the Village, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate
involved.
 
   (b)   Abatement. If the Director of Public Service and Safety determines
that a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined in Section
560.01 occurs later than thirteen (13) days after the date of the initial
written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12) months after the
date of the fourth or any subsequent nuisance activity, the Village may abate
the nuisance activity by using administrative and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be charged to the owner of the property and,
if not paid, may be certified by the Director of Finance to the County Auditor
to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as other taxes
and returned to the Village. The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be
calculated as set forth in division
   (c)   The Village shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property
of the Village's decision to charge the cost of abatement. If the costs are not
paid by the owner, the Village shall notify the owner at least thirty (30) days
before the costs are certified to the County Auditor. The notice shall contain
a street address or legal description of the property, a description of the
nuisance activities and the cost to abate. Notices shall be served as set forth
in division (a) of this section. The Director of Law may take any other action
necessary to collect the costs of abatement.
 
   (d)    Costs of Abatement. Costs of abatement shall be determined based on
the time required to respond to the nuisance activity multiplied by an hourly
rate based upon the wages and benefits of a police officer, animal warden,
building department inspector or other enforcement officer, dispatch costs,
vehicle and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based on the number of police officers and/or other
Village employees required to abate the nuisance.
 
   (e)    Nuisance Abatement Plan. The owner of a nuisance property may avoid
being charged the cost of abating future nuisances if the owner meets with the
Director of Public Service and Safety; presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is approved by the Director of Public Service
and Safety; and implements the plan.
 
   (f)   Appeal. The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice
declaring the owner's property to be a nuisance property, a notice charging the
cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the cost of abatement shall
be certified to the County Auditor, may appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to reconsider to the Director of Public Service and Safety
within ten (10) days of the date of the notice. If, after a decision on that
request, the owner disagrees with the decision, the owner may appeal the
decision of the Director of Public Service and Safety to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be made within fifteen
(15) days of the postmark date of the decision from the Director of Public
Service and Safety denying the request for reconsideration. The Board shall
conduct a hearing and render a decision in accordance with Village ordinances
and rules governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall not stay any actions by the Village to abate any subsequent
nuisance activity. In an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals of a nuisance
declaration notice, the Village must show by a preponderance of the evidence
that there was probable cause to believe that each nuisance activity stated in
the notice being appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the
property as a nuisance property is justified. In an appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals of a notice charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a
notice that the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, the
Village must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the charging of
abatement costs or the certification of abatement costs is justified. The owner
may prevail on appeal of any notice if the owner demonstrates by a
preponderance of the evidence that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but promptly and
vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of division (C) of Section
5321.17 and division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the Revised Code; or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of division (C)
of Section 5321.17 and division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 20-2017. Passed 10-5-17; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
560.03 FAILURE TO ABATE NUISANCE ACTIVITY.
   (a)   Whenever a property owner has been billed on three (3) or more
separate dates within a two-year time period for the cost to abate nuisance
activity under this Chapter, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall
notify the property owner that he or she may be issued a criminal citation for
a misdemeanor of the second degree thirty (30) days after the third bill is
issued.
   (b)   No property owner shall fail to abate nuisance activity within thirty
(30) days after the third bill within a two-year time period for the cost to
abate nuisance activity under this Chapter.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to abate nuisance
activity, a misdemeanor of the second degree.
(Ord. 20-2017. Passed 10-5-17; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
560.04 OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS NOT AFFECTED.
   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the
charging or assessment of costs by the Village on a property under this
chapter, do not affect or limit the Village's right or authority to bring
criminal prosecution or other legal action against any person for violation of
the Village's ordinances.
(Ord. 20-2017. Passed 10-5-17.)
560.05 SEVERABILITY.
   If any clause, sentence, paragraph or part of this chapter, or its
application to any person or circumstance shall for any reason be adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
impair or invalidate the remainder of this Chapter nor the application of such
clause, sentence, paragraph or part to other persons or circumstances but shall
be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph or part and to
the persons or circumstances directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered. It is declared to be the legislative intent
that this chapter would have been adopted had such provisions not been included
or such persons or circumstances been expressly excluded from their coverage.

705.02 INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice. Upon the adoption of this chapter and the certification of the
Village by the FCC, the Village or the ICRC shall immediately notify all cable
operators in the Village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the
Village intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier
and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   (b)   Cable Operator Response. Within thirty days of receiving notice from
the Village or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the Village or the
ICRC, its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and
any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the Village.
      (2)   If Council or the ICRC takes no action within thirty days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the Village, the
proposed rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
sixty days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with
the Village and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of- service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150 day
period, Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (e)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (f)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector’s name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark Analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
Council or the ICRC’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent (10%) or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. Council will review a
cost-of-service review. Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the
benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the
cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minimum ten percent (10%) will
prescribe the cable operator’s new rates.
   (i)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the Village or the ICRC
of its review of the cable operator’s proposed rates, Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or

reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with subsections (g) or (h) hereof, as applicable.
In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers,
refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at
applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for
paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC
regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and Council shall give public notice of
its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official
newspaper of the Village.
   (j)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with the
applicable federal regulations.

705.03 REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice. A cable operator in the Village who wishes to increase the
rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request
with the Village and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least thirty days
before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may
not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing. 
      (1)   If Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the Village.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the Village, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objection.
   (c)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council
shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional
periods of time as applicable to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council or the ICRC needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of- service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the
applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety to 150 day
period, Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (e)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector’s name
and address.
   (f)   Delayed Determination. If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issued a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price Cap Analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, Council shall
review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on Council’s findings, the basic cable rates shall
be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.

shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the Village secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.

period as described in subsection (c) hereof; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with

739.01  PURPOSE.
   The United States Supreme Court has recognized that door-to-door canvassers,
"whether selling pots or distributing leaflets, may lessen the peaceful
enjoyment of a home," and that "burglars frequently pose as canvassers, whether
in order that they may have a pretense to discover whether a house is empty and
hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the premises in order
that they may return later." Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 144
(1943). These problems continue to be associated with door-to-door canvassing,
as are even graver ones. Therefore, the public purpose of this chapter is to
vigorously protect the First Amendment right of free speech and its
accompanying promise of anonymity for the door-to-door canvassers, while
prudently balancing that right with the government's equally important role in
preventing fraud, minimizing crime, protecting the personal security of its
citizens, and above all, facilitating every citizen's right to privacy.

901.01 AUTHORITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND SAFETY DIRECTOR.
   The Director of Public Service and Safety is authorized to adopt rules and
regulations governing the making of excavations in streets, alleys, sidewalks
and public ways of the Village and the manner in which the paving is to be
restored.
(Ord. 17-1931. Passed 3-12-31; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
901.02 APPLICATIONS AND PERMITS.
   Street excavation permits shall be issued by the Director of Public Service
and Safety in pursuance of a written application filed in the office of the
Department. Applications and permits shall be on forms provided by the Public
Service and Safety Director. The application shall give the dimensions and
location of the proposed excavation, the purpose for which the excavation is
made, the kind of pavement to be opened, and the approximate time when the cut
will be made. Permits will be issued only for cuts to be made within one week
of the date of issue. The time allowed for closing the excavation will be
governed by the size and nature of the proposed
excavation.
(Ord. 17-1931. Passed 3-12-31; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
901.03 DEPOSIT.
   (a)    The applicant shall make a cash deposit of six dollars ($6.00) per
square foot of excavation. The minimum deposit is fifty dollars ($50.00). Such
deposit shall be returned to the applicant, upon written request, provided the
final restoration of the pavement is to the complete satisfaction of the
Director of Public Service and Safety or his representative. Noncompliance with
the rules and procedures of street excavation restoration could result in the
forfeiture of the deposit.
   (b)    The applicant may open a running account by making a suitable initial
deposit to be replenished from time to time. In such cases, when a permit is
desired, there must be an unencumbered balance equal to the estimated
restoration charge.
(A.O.; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
901.04 FINAL RESTORATION.
   Complete restoration, including paving surface and paving base will be done
by the permittee to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Service and
Safety.
(A.O.; Ord. 24-2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
901.05 TRENCHING; BACKFILLING; TUNNELING.
   (a)    The length, width and location of the trench, and the manner in which
the work is done shall be under the control of the Public Service Department.
Every precaution shall be taken to safeguard the work and to inconvenience the
public as little as possible.
(Ord. 17-1931. Passed 3-12-31.)
   (b)    The permittee shall carefully remove the paving material and base
course. The excavated material, unless otherwise decreed, shall be hauled away
as waste material. At no time during excavation shall this material be piled so
as to obstruct gutters or drains. Every precaution shall be taken to safeguard
the work and to inconvenience the public as little as possible.
   (c)    Trenches must be properly sheeted and braced where necessary, to
prevent caving, slipping or cracking of sides. Sheeting and bracing used to
support the sides of the trench shall be carefully removed as the backfilling
of the trench progresses, but if considered necessary by the Director of Public
Service and Safety, for the protection of the banks, the sheeting and bracing
shall be left in the trench.
   (d)    Where, in excavating the trench or laying pipe and appurtenances, the
pavement along the sides of the trench is or becomes undermined and
unsupported, the permittee shall at his own cost and expense, break down and
remove the pavement and the foundation of the same, remove all loose earth and
replace the same with earth properly rammed.
   (e)    Tunneling is often necessary where a pipe or conduit passes under the
curb or other conduits. The permittee, however, shall not do any tunneling,
except by permission of the Director of Public Service and Safety. Where
tunneling has been done for convenience to the permittee on account of traffic
reasons, the permittee shall, before backfilling, remove the pavement base and
all material over the full length and width of the tunneled section of the
trench and then backfill the same, as hereinafter specified. Where the
tunneling has been done for either of the reasons mentioned, the permittee
shall bed the conduit being installed in fine material to a height of one foot
above the top thereof. This fine material shall be wetted and tamped under,
around and over the pipe or conduit in the most thorough and careful manner.
The balance of the space from the top of this filling to the roof of the tunnel
shall be completely filled with 1-4-8 concrete, thoroughly tamped to fill the
entire space and to afford a rigid support for the tunnel roof for its entire
area., The filling concrete shall be of the proper consistency for tamping into
place.
   (f)    In the installation of small service pipes, it is suggested that the
pipe be jacked through and under car tracks, curbs, etc. or that a sufficient
hole be bored for the pipe. In such cases, no charge will be made for
resurfacing the street over services so installed.
   (g)    Whenever culverts, sewers, manholes, valve chambers, catch basin
connections, water mains, gas pipe or electric conduits or the house
connections thereto, are exposed in excavating or cross the trench, they must
be taken care of by the permittee, by firmly supporting the same at his own
expense until the trench is refilled and made secure.
   (h)    Whenever the trench crosses under any railroad track, notice must be
previously given by the permittee to the corporation owning the track and a
reasonable time must be given by the corporation to support and maintain the
tracks for the running of cars over the trench. Any cost of supporting and
maintaining the tracks shall be paid by the permittee. No obstructions of any
kind shall be placed upon the tracks.
   (i)    The permittee shall use all proper precautions to protect persons
from injury. Proper guards shall be placed along the line of the trench and
sufficient red lights placed to protect traffic from damage. (A.O.; Ord. 24-
2019. Passed 12-17-19.)
901.06 MANNER OF RESTORATION.
   (a)   Upon completion of any repairs to utilities requiring excavation of
Village roads, streets and sidewalks the repairing agency or contractor shall
cover the excavation with steel plate of sufficient strength to carry the
traffic over the excavation without harm to the adjacent roadway and the
margins of the excavation, and shall leave such steel plate in place until the
permanent repair of the excavation is completed. Steel plates used on sidewalks
should have a nonskid surface.
   (b)   The permanent repair shall be completed within sixty days of the
completion of the repair of the underground utilities.
   (c)   Permanent repair shall consist of the like thickness and of like
material that was originally excavated. Subgrade material shall be compacted to
a density of ninety-five percent (95%).
   (d)   No agency or contractor who finds it necessary to excavate in
roadways, streets or sidewalks in the Village shall close such an excavation
with a temporary asphalt patch.
   (e)   For the purposes of construing this section, “utilities” includes
electrical wiring, telephone cables, gas lines, water lines, and storm and
sanitary sewer lines.
(Ord. 28-1991. Passed 5-16-91.)
901.07 INSPECTION FEES.

         $5.00 for inspection.
         5.00 for sewer tap.    (Storm sewer only. Sanitary sewer tap to be

managed or maintained by the owner or person in control of the property on
which all such vegetation is located which exceeds eight (8) inches in height
restrictions, but shall exclude trees, shrubs, cultivated flowers, and

mortgage agreement, until title to the premises is transferred to a third
party.
      (2)   Any owner or person in control of any lot or parcel of land which
falls within the corporate limits shall keep and maintain such lot or land free
and clear from all litter, prohibited noxious weeds, invasive plant species,
and rank vegetation. The owner or person in control shall have the duty to
remove or otherwise destroy prohibited noxious weeds and invasive plant
species, and to mulch or, in the alternative, rake and remove all clippings and
waste resulting from the cutting of weeds, grasses and vegetation.
         (Ord. 20-2024. Passed 8-22-24.)
905.04  NOTICE TO OWNERS/TIME ALLOTTED FOR ABATEMENT.
      (a)   The Director of Public Service and Safety or their designee may
cause written notice of violation of Chapter
905 to be served personally upon the owner or person in control, or by sending
to that person by certified mail, or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous
place on the premises or property involved. This notice shall state the nature
of the public nuisance and the time, not less than five (5) days, within which
it shall be abated. No owner or person in control of the property so notified
shall refuse to comply with the notice.
   In the event the certified mail notice is returned as "Unclaimed" or
"Refused", the Director of Public Service and Safety or their designee shall
post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises or property
involved. The five (5) day time limit begins when the notice is posted.
(Ord. 22-2024. Passed 8-22-24.)

905.05  ABATEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF COST BY VILLAGE.
   (a)    Abatement and Assessment. If the public nuisance is not abated within
the required time, the Director of Public Service and Safety or their designer
may enter the property to abate the nuisance and enforce the provisions of this
section. After the public nuisance is abated, the Village shall give notice by
certified mail to the owner or person in control at the last known address to
pay the cost of such trimming or removal of weeds, grasses, or litter, which
notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the amount of the cost of such

shall be assessed as provided in subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Appeal. Any owner or person in control may appeal the assessment of
the cost of abating the nuisance and of the associated processing charge. In
order to perfect such an appeal, the owner or person in control shall file,
within fifteen (15) days after the mailing date of the notice, an appeal to the
Village Council. Council shall then review the matter and render a final
determination after affording the owner or person in control an opportunity to
be heard either in person or writing. Except to the extent otherwise appealable
by law, Council's decision shall be final. The owner or person in control shall
be given notice of Council's decision by certified mail at the last known
address.
         The filing of an appeal shall toll the thirty (30) day payment period
provided for in subsection (a) hereof. In the event the owner or person in
control loses their appeal in whole or in part, payment in full shall be made
to the Village within ten (10) days after the mailing of the notice of
Council's decision. If payment is not received by the Village in the time
provided, then the amount shall be assessed as provided in subsection (c)
hereof.
   (c)    Lien Upon Property. The Village Auditor shall certify in written to
the County Auditor the action taken under the preceding sections, with a
statement of the charges for labor, material, and equipment incurred in the
cutting and removing of the noxious weeds and litter, and the processing charge
as specified above, along with a proper description of the premises. The
amounts shall be entered upon the tax duplicate as a weed cutting, tree
trimming and/or litter removal assessment and be a lien upon the land from and
after the date of entry and be collected as other taxes and returned to the
Village with the General Fund settlements.
    If, after the Village abates the public nuisance, the owner or person in
controls continues to fail to comply with Chapter
905 and the Village incurs additional expenses abating such public nuisance,
the Village may certify all such additional amounts to the County Auditor, to
be placed upon the tax duplicate and collected and paid back to the Village.
   (d)   Collection. At its sole discretion, the Village may take such other
action permitted by law to collect any outstanding amounts due to the Village
for abatement of the public nuisance.
(Ord. 21-2024. Passed 8-22-24.)
905.06 ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF VIOLATIONS.
   Enforcement of the provisions of this chapter shall be by the Director of
Public Service and Safety or their designee. The Director of Public Service and
Safety or their designee is authorized and empowered at any reasonable time to

the erection of a substantial structure, and further provided that a zoning
certificate for such use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and

   In considering an application for a conditional use, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses
and structures, and in authorizing a conditional use, the Board may impose such
requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance
and operation - in addition to those expressly stipulated in this Zoning

for the protection of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity and general welfare and for the protection of adjacent properties.
(Ord. 12-1996. Passed 10-10-66.)
1131.12 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance. In case of any question as to the location of
any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the
Zoning Map may be made to the Board and a determination shall be made by the
Board. In considering an interpretation of the Zoning Map, the Board shall give
due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures.
(Ord. 12-1996. Passed 10-10-66.)
1131.13 VARIANCES AUTHORIZED.
   In authorizing a variance the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach thereto
such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the
proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the interest of the
furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and in the public
interest. In authorizing a variance with attached conditions, the Board shall

the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not
apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in the same zoning
district;
   (b)    That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the same vicinity; and
   (c)    That the authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the purposes of
this Zoning Ordinance or public interest.
   No grant of variance shall be authorized unless the Board specifically finds
that the condition or situation of the specific piece of property, or the
intended use of said property for which variance is sought - one or the other
or in combination - is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make
reasonably practical the formulation of a general regulation for such
conditions or situations.
(Ord. 12-1966. Passed 10-10-66.)
1131.15 VARIANCES: BOARD MAY REVERSE ORDERS, ETC.
   In exercising its power the Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity with
the provisions of statute and of this Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken.

1131.16 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
    In considering an appeal from an alleged error in the administration of
this Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the intent
and purpose of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance that apply and the
effect of the desired interpretation upon neighboring properties in the public
interest. In exercising its power to review such an allegation, the Board may,
in conformity with the provisions of statute and of this Zoning Ordinance,
reverse or affirms wholly or partly, or may modify the order, decision or

1159.01 SCOPE
   (a)   To replace in its entirety Chapter
1159 of the Zoning Code.
   (b)   The provisions of this Chapter supersede any provisions that may be in
conflict with the remainder of the Zoning Code. (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.02 PURPOSE.
   Heritage Hill District (HHD) is established in order to impose specific
design criteria for both rehabilitation and new construction projects within
the Heritage Hill District of St. Bernard. Therefore the purposes of this
chapter are to:
   (a)   Ensure that new development in the Heritage Hill District shall
conform to the Village's general plans for the physical development of this
district
   (b)   Guide development and redevelopment in the Heritage Hill District to
protect and enhance the Village's image.
   (c)   Ensure that new development and redevelopment respects the Village's
historic qualities and resources through thoughtful and compatible design.
   (d)   Provide the basis for consistency and objective decision-making by
providing criteria and a review process to be used by the Zoning Administrator,
Planning Commission, Streetscape Committee and Village Council when evaluating
proposed development.
   (e)   Provide standards for property owners, architects and contractors to
aid in the preparation of appropriate plans.
   (f)   Increase public awareness of the value of good design in the Village.
   (g)   To create a more cohesive development pattern and density.
   (h)   To strengthen the District by promoting redevelopment that enhances
the visual and economic vitality of the District. (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-
11.)
1159.03 APPLICABILITY OF DISTRICT.
   All Vine Street properties designated OB-1, OB-2, R-3 on the official zoning
map of the Village shall be subject to the regulations of this chapter.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.04 USE REGULATIONS.
   All uses in the HHD shall be governed as listed in Schedule of Permitted
Uses.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   All lots, buildings, and structures in the HHD shall comply with the
standards set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.06 RESIDENTIAL LOT REQUIREMENTS.
   Lot requirements for all residential uses as permitted in the HHD shall be
regulated as set forth in Title Seven of the Zoning Code. (Ord. 32-2011. Passed
6-2-11.)
   SITES OF TWO ACRES OR MORE.
   (a)   Cohesive multi-structure developments are desirable and are strongly
encouraged in the HHD to enhance the existing urban features of the district
and to present a more coordinated streetscape to the Village. Any site within
the HHD which is equal to or greater than two acres shall be required to be
developed with multiple structures and a mix of uses. Lots of two or more acres
recorded as of the date of adoption of this chapter may not be subdivided into
smaller lots to avoid this regulation.
   (b)   After a final site plan has been approved by the Village, an applicant
may subdivide the total development into separate parcels for tax billing
purposes. The subdivided parcels shall remain subject to the approved
development plan and shall not be considered as non-conforming lots or uses
when developed under the approved plan. Any subsequent redevelopment of the
subdivided lots must be consistent with the approved site plan and shall be
considered as a modification to the approved plan subject to the review and
approval process of the Village, unless such modification is exempted as
provided therein.
   (c)   When feasible multiple smaller lots (less than two acres) are
encouraged to be consolidated and redeveloped under a single plan in a manner
that is consistent with the standards of the HHD for multiple building
developments.
      (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.07 SITE LAYOUT CRITERIA.
   The layout of principal buildings, accessory structures, and parking areas
along Vine Street are primary identifying features of the Village. The HHD is
an existing business area that features a partially defined street wall which
creates a pedestrian street environment. The street wall is defined by
buildings which are set close to the street. Creating an attractive, strongly
defined street wall in the HHD will improve the visual appearance and
distinguish the Village from the surrounding communities. Standards for single
structure developments and multi-building developments are presented in
subsequent sections.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.08 BUILDING SETBACKS.
   The setbacks for buildings in the HHD shall be determined as follows:
   (a)   The use of a parking structure for setback purposes shall be
determined as follows: A parking structure shall be considered non-residential
unless residential and only residential uses are built above the parking
structure at the point of measure.
   (b)   Front yard setback. Front yard setbacks in the HHD are encouraged to
create a street wall and buildings should be set a consistent distance from the
right-of-way. The following regulations apply to front yard setbacks:
      (1)   The maximum front yard setback for buildings shall be ten feet from
the right-of-way.
      (2)   To meet the required setback, a building's facade must meet the
site layout and building configuration requirements of Section 
1159.09(a)(1).
      (3) For panhandle lots, see Section
1159.09(c)(2).
      (4)   Exception for upper stories. The facades of buildings above the
required minimum height established in Section
1159.13(a)(1) may be set back farther than ten feet from the right-of-way.
      (5)   Exception for multiple buildings. An adequate number of buildings
and front facades on each site must meet the maximum required setback of ten
feet from the right-of-way to create a consistent street wall along the
frontage of the site in conformance with Section
1159.07. However, if the frontage of the site is designed with buildings at the
setback line, the Village may allow additional buildings on the site to exceed
this setback if they find that the development meets the other standards of
this chapter and accomplishes the purpose of this district.
   (c)   Side yard setbacks. Side yard setbacks for development in the HHD
shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Buildings shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the side
lot line when adjacent to any non-residential use outside of the HHD.
      (2)   When adjacent to a residential use outside of the HHD a building
must be set back in accordance with existing regulations.
      (3)   Zero side lot line structures with a shared firewall may be
permitted in a development under initial common ownership.
   (d)   Rear yard setbacks. Rear yard setbacks for development in the HHD
shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Commercial or non-residential structures shall be set back a
minimum of 45 feet from the rear lot line or boundary line of adjacent
residential properties outside of the HHD district.
      (2)   Commercial or non-residential structures shall be set back 15 feet
from the rear property line when adjacent to a lot within the HHD district.
      (3)   Residential structures shall be located no closer than eight feet,
or one-half the height of the building, whichever is greater, to the rear
project boundary line of the development.
         (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.09 SITE LAYOUT AND BUILDING CONFIGURATION.
   (a)   General Site Layout. Along Vine Street frontages, the general site
layout shall conform to the following standards.
      (1)   A minimum of 60% of a development's frontage on Vine Street must be
occupied by building frontage, and an additional 10% may be occupied by
building frontage or a wall as specified below, which is located no further
than ten feet from the front property line. The building wall shall be an
extension of the principal or accessory building(s). The Village may allow up
to 50% of a building's surface to be set back further than ten feet to create
facade articulation or provide a plaza or another useful outdoor pedestrian
space along the frontage.
      (2)   Walls shall be constructed of solid masonry and shall have a height
not less than three feet nor greater than eight feet, not including
ornamentation or other features.
      (3)   The remaining 30% of a development's frontage on Vine Street may be
used for necessary vehicle and pedestrian access ways.
   (b)   Parking. Parking lots or parking structures shall be regulated as
follows:
      (1)   Parking lots shall meet the setback standards as established
Chapter
1181.
      (2)   Parking structures, lots, or spaces shall not be located in the
front yard and shall meet the side and rear project boundary setbacks
established for buildings in Section
1159.08.
      (3)   Parking structures, lots, and spaces shall be buffered or screened
at a minimum as required, per Chapter
1181.
   (c)   In multi-building developments, a parking lot may be located between a
rear building and a building fronting on Vine Street.
   (d)   Building Coverage. Building coverage in the HHD shall be regulated as
follows:
      (1)   Single building developments. A single building fronting on Vine
Street shall not have a footprint which exceeds 15,000 square feet.
      (2)   Panhandle lots. Any building on a panhandle lot with less than 25
feet of frontage along Vine Street shall be treated as a rear building for
coverage purposes.
      (3)   Multiple building developments. When included in a multiple-
building development on a site in excess of two acres, a single building may
have a footprint in excess of 15,000 square feet if the Village finds that it
meets the following regulations:
         A.   Under no circumstances may a building's footprint exceed 30,000
square feet;
         B.   The building is part of a multiple-building development;
         C.   Adequate parking for the building's use as specified in Chapter
1181 can be accommodated in whole or in part in on-site structured parking,
which is integrated into the development design;
         D.   Off-street loading areas are provided for the building in
accordance with Chapter
1181.
         E.   The building and required parking are screened from the public
right-of-way in accordance to Chapter
1181.
         F.   The loading, parking, and trash dumpsters are adequately screened
from adjacent residential uses; and
         G.   The building meets all other building design standards as
specified by this chapter.
   (e)   Loading and Service Areas. Loading and service areas shall be located
and designed in such a way as to minimize visual and noise impact on adjacent
residential uses. The use of solid walls and buffer landscaping is encouraged
to reduce the visual and noise impact of loading and service areas from
adjacent rights-of-way and residential areas.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.10 PEDESTRIAN AND VEHICULAR ACCESS AND CIRCULATION.
   Safe, efficient, and convenient circulation and access to and between
developments should be provided for both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. By
creating a safe continuous network of pedestrian walkways within the HHD
development and adjacent Village Centre development, pedestrians will feel more
inclined to safely walk, rather than drive, between stores. A pedestrian system
that offers clear circulation paths from the parking areas to building entries
creates a friendlier, more inviting image.
   (a)   Pedestrian Access and Circulation. Pedestrian facilities shall be
designed to meet the following standards:
      (1)   Sites that are more than two acres shall emphasize pedestrian
orientation by creating attractive pedestrian spaces that are landscaped and
include other appropriate elements to facilitate pedestrian activity. Efforts
should be made to incorporate public open spaces into the design of the
development.
      (2)   All commercial developments shall provide attractive, well-marked
pedestrian links between parking and buildings. The connections shall be
clearly marked to provide safe access across traffic lanes and landscaped
areas. Such walkways shall utilize decorative paving at key locations.
      (3)   All commercial buildings shall be public accessible via a path or
walkway from a public sidewalk.
      (4)   Any sidewalk or walkway shall be designed to connect to adjacent
walkways of either existing or future development.
      (5)   All redevelopment along Vine Street in the HHD must comply with the
Streetscaping master plan. New public walkways, connecting sidewalks and new
rights-of-way should incorporate the standards from the Streetscaping Master
Plan.
      (6)   Parking area design shall include provisions for pedestrian access
from parking areas to building entrances.
   (b)   Vehicular Access and Circulation. Vehicular access and circulation
shall be designed to meet the following standards:
      (1)   Primary vehicle entrances. The number and location of vehicle
entrances to a commercial development are subject to review by the Village and
the approval of the Village and will be based on the following factors to
promote good traffic management practices:
         A.   A site shall not be separated into additional tracts or plats to
artificially allow additional access points.
         B.   The development shall minimize the number of curb cuts with
shared access being preferred.
         C.   Provide adequate improvements to the right-of-way to handle
increases in traffic generated by the development. These improvements may
include but are not limited to, turn lanes and traffic control devices.
         D.   Where possible, access points should align with previously
approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street to
reduce conflict points.
      (2)   Internal vehicle circulation. Safe and efficient internal
circulation shall be provided. Where possible, internal vehicle circulation
should be designed as follows:
         A.   Parking lots should be designed with a hierarchy of circulation:
major access drives with no parking; major circulation drives with limited
parking, and then parking aisles for direct access to parking spaces. Smaller
developments may need to combine components of the hierarchy.
         B.   Main drive aisles should be continuous and connect to the main
entrance to the development site.
         C.   Internal driveways or parking aisles should intersect at angles
of between 80 and 100 degrees, with 90 degrees being preferred.
         D.   Internal driveways or aisles that are intersected by crossing
traffic should either have their centerlines aligned or be offset by at least
60 feet.
      (3)   On-site truck traffic/loading and circulation. Every development is
required to provide on-site loading and delivery facilities separate from
customer parking and pedestrian areas.
         A.   Truck circulation paths shall be designed with adequate curve
radii and maneuvering room.
         B.   Loading and service areas shall be located in such a way that
trucks accessing the site should not need to back into the site from a public
right-of-way, nor back out of the site onto the public right-of-way.
         C.   Loading areas must be large enough that trucks do not partially
or fully obstruct traffic flow on Vine Street or side streets during loading
activities.
      (4)   Connections to adjacent non-residential uses. To the maximum extent
feasible, vehicular and access connections shall be provided between adjacent
nonresidential development parcels.
         (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.11 PARKING.
    Parking in an urban setting is often difficult and in order to promote an
urban setting, surface parking and structured parking shall be designed in a
way to reduce its visual impact from Vine Street.
   (a)   Multi-building Developments. To promote an urban density, parking
should be provided as follows in multi-building developments:
      (1)   Structured parking is encouraged for 50% of the required parking on
sites with multi-building developments.
      (2)   The Village may, at its discretion, permit a reduction in the
number of off-street parking spaces required for a development to as much as
50% of the required spaces per Chapter
1181.
   (b)   Surface Parking. Surface parking lots shall be designed in accordance
with existing Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations.
      (1)   Surface parking shall be limited to no more than 35% of the site
area.
      (2)   Adequate screening and interior landscaping shall be provided for
surface-parking as specified in Chapter
1181.
   (c)   Parking Structures. Parking structures should be encouraged to be
located in the interior of the site to reduce the visual impact from Vine
Street.
      (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.12 BUILDING DESIGN.
   The architecture and general design of the buildings in the HHD will be the
strongest feature in creating an image for the Village. Building design should
be of a high quality with attention to the creation of a human scale
environment that ties into the historic architectural character of the HHD.
(Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.13 SCALE AND MASSING.
   (a)   The relationship of a building's height to its apparent width is a
major contributing factor to the overall character of the HHD.
   (b)   Building height. The height of all buildings in the HHD shall meet the
following standards:
      (1)   The minimum building height for all buildings shall be two stories
for the front facade along Vine Street or on any interior street (existing or
proposed). All other buildings shall have the appearance of a minimum of two
stories.
      (2)   The maximum height of primary facades shall not exceed 45 feet as
measured from the grade line to the gutter on buildings fronting on Vine Street
or on any interior street (existing or proposed).
      (3)   Additional stories or height are permissible for the rear or side
facades or buildings not directly facing onto Vine Street when lower grade
lines allow.
      (4)   A building's vertical and horizontal dimensions shall be in
proportion to one another without over-emphasis of either dimension.
Horizontally long buildings shall be visually broken up through the use of
recesses or setback variations, to cause the facade to appear as a series of
proportionally correct masses. The building's articulation should help
establish a human scale and provide visual rhythms and interest.
         (Ord. 32-2011. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.14  ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.
   To create a more interesting and inviting environment all buildings shall
include architectural details, including but not limited to cornices, and
window and door trim. Buildings shall be designed with a distinct architectural
style that respects the historic character of the HHD but adequately
accommodates the intended modern uses. When authentic architectural details
such as windows and doors are not feasible, simulated openings may be approved.
   (a)   Roof Type. The roof types of buildings in the HHD shall be designed in
conformance with the following regulations:
      (1)   For approximately every front 25 feet of building facade a
variation of roof type is encouraged to reduce visual monotony and assist in
development of a human scale environment.
      (2)   Gabled roofs are encouraged; however, other roof types may be
approved by the Village on a case-by-case basis.
      (3)   When gabled roofs are used, the design of the roof pitch may vary,
but should not be less than one-quarter of the building height as measured from
the grade line to the gutter.
      (4)   The appearance of flat roofs is prohibited. The use of decorative
cornices and parapet roof lines are encouraged to reduce the appearance of a
flat roof and screen rooftop equipment.
   (b)   Building Entrances. The building entrances in the HHD shall be
designed in conformance with the following regulations:
      (1)   When a commercial building has frontage on Vine Street, the
building entrances should be encouraged to face onto Vine Street when feasible.
      (2)   When a residential building has frontage on Vine Street, the first
floor entrances should be located facing Vine Street when feasible. Access to
upper stories from Vine Street is strongly encouraged.
      (3)   When a new road or pedestrian pathway is proposed for interior
circulation and meets the streetscaping requirements as detailed in the
Village's Streetscaping plan, buildings may be oriented to face onto these
streets and the entrance may also be oriented to these streets.
      (4)   In all cases the main entrance of the building shall be easily
identifiable, and should provide an introductory statement for a building using
architectural articulation or landscaping or a combination of both.
      (5)   Entrances should be designed to allow individual business to
present a clear image without compromising the sense of unity of the facade or
development.
   (c)   Windows. Windows in the HHD shall be designed in conformance with the
following regulations:
      (1)   The shape and configuration of windows for buildings in the HHD
should maintain a consistent rhythm and pattern throughout the development.
      (2)   A window's proportions should generally be vertical with the height
being approximately two times the width of the window, however, display windows
in commercial structures may be larger than those typical in a residential
structure and do not need to have this exact proportion.
      (3)   Generally, windows should be subdivided and separated by mullions.
Large expanses of glass should be used in limited amounts as storefront display
windows, and should relate to the architectural style of the buildings. Large
undivided display windows or plate glass windows are appropriate only on the
ground floor for display purposes.
      (4)   Window and door openings on the ground floor of a commercial
building should occupy no less than 50% of the building's facade length on any
facade facing Vine Street. Upper story window and door openings should be
proportioned to the first floor as in division (c)(5) of this section.
      (5)   Windows in all structures shall exhibit symmetry and proportion to
the building. To ensure that the windows on the first floor relate properly to
windows on the upper floors, the length of a hypothetical rectangle that
encompasses all first story windows and doors must be the same length as that
of a rectangle that encompasses all second story windows.
      (6)   Windows should be detailed with architectural elements such as
projecting sills, molded surrounds and/or lintels. Windows shall be constructed
of clear glazing and tinted glazing shall not be used.
      (7)   Vinyl or vinyl clad windows are prohibited.
         (Ord. 32-11. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.15 EXTERIOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.
   The character of the HHD is enhanced by the use of quality building
materials that reflect the desired image of the HHD. The following standards
apply to the exterior of all buildings in the HHD.
   (a)   Permitted Materials. The use of exterior building and finishing
materials in the HHD shall be in conformance with the following regulations:
        (1)   Primary materials.
         A.   Buildings shall have a primary exterior covering of brick, stone,
natural wood clapboard, wood board and batten, wood shingles or modern
manufactured materials that create the appearance of the materials listed above
except as prohibited herein.
         B.   The color of brick is encouraged to be in the red-orange range.
The color should be uniform rather than being mottled or speckled.
      (2)   Accent materials. Buildings in the HHD may incorporate any of the
above permitted primary materials as an accent. Exterior insulated finish
systems (EIFS) and decorative concrete masonry units may be used on a building
as an accent that comprises no more than 15% per side of the building's
exterior wall surface.
      (3)   Other materials that are not listed as prohibited may be approved
by the village on a case-by-case basis as a primary or accent building
material.
   (b)   Prohibited Materials. Exterior covering materials that are prohibited
include vinyl, aluminum, or steel siding, standard concrete masonry units, or
tilt-up concrete.
      (Ord. 32-11. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.16 COLORS.
   (a)   Permitted Colors. The base colors used on buildings should be the
natural color of the material in the case of brick or stone or of a neutral
muted palette. Brighter, more vivid colors should be reserved for limited use
as trim or accent. Permitted colors may be further regulated as established in
Section
1159.23(a).
   (b)   Prohibited Colors. No fluorescent, reflective, metallic or neon colors
shall be used on a building in the HHD.
(Ord. 32-11. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.17 VARIATION OF MATERIALS AND COLORS ON FACADES.
   Variation of materials and colors on facades is permissible, provided the
variation enhances the human scale of the buildings, and is used to define
specific elements of the building. General guidelines for variations in
materials are:
   (a)   A maximum of three colors, excluding the natural color of brick or
stone, may be used on a single structure, except in the case where the
building's facade is designed to appear as more than one building. In such
case, each element may use a combination of colors as approved by the
Streetscape Committee, but the overall color scheme of the building should be
coordinated.
   (b)   Changes in materials should occur at inside corners of buildings or
transition with an appropriate trim detail. Material changes at outside corners
or in the middle of a wall give an impression of thinness and artificiality
which should be avoided.
   (c)   The use of a coordinating trim material is encouraged on all facades
of a building, and should be used to break larger wall plans into smaller, more
human-scale elements.
   (d)   The number of materials on the exterior of a building should be
limited to a few complementary materials.
   (e)   A palette of proposed materials and colors should be submitted by the
applicant for approval by the Village.
(Ord. 32-11. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.18 SIGNAGE.
   Signage shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Chapter
1185, Sign Regulations.
   (a)   Signs should respect the overall architectural composition of the
building and its scale while not overwhelming the facade. Sign colors must be
complementary to the building's material and colors must meet the permitted
colors for the HHD as set forth in Section
1159.16(a). Signs may not cover architectural features.
   (b)   Wall signs should be affixed on a continuous, flat, vertical, opaque
surface and cannot project more than six inches from the building surface.
   (c)   Wall signs should not extend higher than the bottom sill of the second
story window, or above the lowest point of the roof, or over 25 feet above
grade (whichever is lower). They must be at least six inches from the lintel or
other trim of the window above or below it.
   (d)   Window signs may only be applied directly to the inside surface of the
window glass. The letters should be four inches or less and symbols cannot be
larger than eight inches.
   (e)   Wall signs should have a simple design and shall not have more than
three lines of letters.
   (f)   Signs shall only be illuminated by an exterior lighting source.
Internally illuminated back lit and neon signage is prohibited.
   (g)   No perpendicular signs are permitted. (Ord. 32-11. Passed 6-2-11.)
1159.19 LIGHTING.
   (a)   Lighting shall be appropriate to the district in type, design,
location and quantity.
   (b)   Lighting shall be used in a limited manner, and only to highlight
architectural details on a building, illuminate a sign, or to illuminate
walkways and/or parking areas.

1165.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the planned unit development district overlay is;
   (a)   To permit development or redevelopment of land within the Village with
greater flexibility than permitted in established zoning districts;
   (b)   To promote the efficient use of land;
   (c)   To encourage the most competent planning in the arrangement of
buildings, the preservation of open space, the utilization of topography and
other site features.
   (d)   To obtain creative and coordinated designs harmonious and compatible
with surrounding land uses.
   The "PUD" establishes procedures that are supplemental to those applicable
in other districts under which development plans particularly designed to meet
these objectives may be prepared. (Ord. 26-2010. Passed 8-5-10.)
1165.02 OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The "PUD" shall be applied as an overlay district on top of existing
established zoning districts that govern land use, setbacks, site density, and
other land use controls. Provisions of the underlying zoning district shall
apply unless altered or superseded by the Planning Commission and Council
approval of a "PUD" on a specific parcel or parcels of land as established by
this Chapter.
   Approval of a "PUD" and its provisions will be based on the proposed
developments ability to meet the spirit and intent of the purposes for the
specific type of "PUD" as stated herein. If the desired land use deviates
significantly from the underlying zone, a zone change in both the underlying
zone and the. request for the establishment of a "PUD" must be applied for at
the same time. (Ord. 26-2010. Passed 8-5-10.)
1165.03 AUTHORITY TO VARY REGULATIONS.
   In connection with approving a Planned Unit Development, the Planning
Commission and Council shall have the authority to approve a Planned Unit
Development that varies from the provisions of this Zoning Code or of the
Subdivision Ordinance provided, however, such variance:
   (a)   Will achieve the purposes for which Planned Unit Developments may be
approved pursuant to the requirements of this Chapter;
   (b)   Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of the
Zoning Code and any Land Use or Comprehensive Plan enacted by the Village;
   (c)    Will not unduly burden adjacent roadways; and
   (d)    Will result in a development providing compensating amenities to the
Village.
      (Ord. 26-2010. Passed 8-5-10.)
   
1165.04  ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY.
   The City Council may establish a Planned Development District Overlay on its
own initiative, on the recommendations of Planning Commission, or upon the
application of a property owner. The procedure for this zone change shall be as
established in Chapter
1129, District Changes and Regulation Amendments.
(Ord. 26-2010. Passed 8-5-10.)
1165.05 TYPES OF PERMISSIBLE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAYS.
   The following are permitted types of Planned Unit Development Overlays.
Proposed uses shall be carefully considered in light of the most recent adopted
Land Use or Comprehensive Plan, the current Zoning Map and surrounding land
uses.

retail commercial, service, wholesale commercial, industrial, institutional,
recreational, or other use, or the exceptional shape or size of the property,
or other exceptional situation and condition would justify such an action.

(Ord. 17-1999. Passed 5-6-99.)
1191.04 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL FOR CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED CELLULAR OR WIRELESS
COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   The following standards shall apply to all conditionally permitted cellular
or wireless communications antennas and towers:
   (a)   The cellular or wireless communications company shall be required to
demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna or tower
must be placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its necessary function
in the company's grid system.
   (b)   If the communications company proposes to build a cellular or wireless
communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing
structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the owners of
nearby tall structures within a one-half mile radius of the site proposed,
asked for permission to install the cellular communications antenna on those
structures and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. "Tall
structures" shall include, but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers,
buildings over fifty feet in height, antenna support structures or other
cellular or wireless communications structures, other communications towers and
roadway lighting poles.
The Village may deny the application to construct a new cellular or wireless
communications tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount
the antenna on existing structures.
(Ord. 22-1997. Passed 6-19-97.)
1191.05 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL OF ALL CELLULAR OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   (a)   Antenna/Tower Height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No
antenna that is taller than the minimum height shall be approved. The maximum
allowable tower height shall be 180 feet.
   (b)   Setbacks from the Base of the Tower. If a new cellular or wireless
communications tower is to be constructed, the minimum distance between the
base of the tower or any guy wire anchors and the property line shall be:
      (1)   Thirty percent (30%) of the tower height but no less than thirty-
five feet.
   (c)   Cellular or Wireless Communications Tower Safety. The applicant shall
demonstrate that the proposed cellular or wireless communications tower and its
antenna are safe and that the surrounding properties will not be negatively
affected by tower failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields
or radio frequency interference. Furthermore, all cellular or wireless
communications towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as approved by
the manufacturers.
   (d)   Fencing. A fence shall be required around the cellular or wireless
communications tower and its support structure(s), unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be minimum of eight feet in
height and shall be erected to prevent access to non-authorized personnel.
   (e)   Landscaping. The following landscaping shall be required to screen as
much of the support structures as possible, the fence surrounding the cellular
or wireless communications tower, support structure(s) and any other ground
level features and, in general, soften the appearance of the cellular or
wireless communications site. The Village may permit any combination of
existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of screening as the
required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted on an existing structure, and
other equipment is housed inside of an existing structure, landscaping shall
not be required.
   Any freestanding cellular or wireless communications tower shall incorporate
landscaping which includes trees, shrubs and other landscaping vegetation that
is subject to review and is acceptable to the Planning Commission. In addition,
existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to greatest
extent possible.
   (f)   Limiting the Number of Cellular or Wireless Communications Towers. In
order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the City in
the future, the proposed cellular or wireless communications tower shall be
required to accommodate other uses, including other cellular or wireless
communications companies, and the local police and fire departments and
paramedic and life squads.
   (g)   Licensing. The communications company must demonstrate to the Village
that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
   (h)   Required Parking. If the cellular or wireless communications site is
fully automated, adequate parking shall be required to maintenance workers. If
the site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall
equal the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in the Zoning Code.
   (i)   Appearance. Cellular or wireless communications towers under 200 feet
in height shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order
to reduce visual impact. Cellular or wireless communications towers shall meet
all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. No cellular or wireless
communications towers may be artificially lighted except when required to the
FAA. Furthermore, no cellular or wireless communications tower or antenna shall
contain any signage containing a commercial message.
   (j)   Site Plan Required. A full site plan shall be required for all

      (12)   The schedule of any phasing of the project.
      (13)   A written statement by the cellular or wireless communications
company as to the visual and aesthetic impacts of the proposed cellular
communications tower on all adjacent residential zoning districts.
      (14)   Any other information as may be required by the Planning
Commission to determine the conformance with this Zoning Code.
   Upon submission of a complete application for site plan review to the
Building Commissioner, the application shall be transmitted to the Planning
Commission where they shall review the site plan to determine if it meets the
purpose and requirements as established in this section, of the zoning district
where the proposed cellular or wireless communications site is located and of
any other applicable Section of the Zoning Code. No public notice or public
hearing shall be required in conjunction with the review and approval of the
Plan.
   However, when the Plan required modification for approval or if the Plan
does not meet the purpose and requirements of the Zoning Code, a full public
hearing on the matter will be conducted with notice to affected parties as in
other matters brought before the Planning Commission.
   There shall be a twenty dollar ($20.00) per linear foot of the tower height
application fee for review of the application in addition to any building
permit fees required under the standard building permit fee schedule.
   The Planning Commission shall act upon all site plans within twenty-eight
days after the receipt of the complete application from the Building
Commissioner by approving the plans or scheduling a public hearing before the
Commission. The Planning Commission may approve, disapprove, or approve with
modifications the site plan as submitted. Within the said twenty-eight day
period, a majority of the members of the Planning Commission present at the
meeting thereof may vote to extend the said period of time, not to exceed an
additional sixty days.

prostitution, pandering, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession and
distribution of obscene materials and child pornography, possession and sale of
controlled substances and violent crime against persons and property.
   (c)   Therefore the Village seeks to minimize and control the adverse
secondary effects determined to be associated with adult entertainment

facilities.
   (e)   It is also not the intent of the Village to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and the Village recognizes that state law
prohibits the distribution of obscene materials.

(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1301.05 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of the STBBC are as follows:
   (a)   General. To provide uniform standards and requirements for the
erection, construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings and
other structures including construction of industrialized units. Such standards
shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings
for their intended use and occupancy.

so far as is practicable, in terms of performance objectives, so as to make
adequate performance for the use intended the test of acceptability.
   (c)   Technological Development. To permit to the fullest extent feasible,
the use of materials and technical methods, devices and improvements, including
the use of industrialized units which tend to reduce the cost of construction
and erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units, and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction.
   (d)   Standardization of Construction. To encourage, so far as may be
practicable, the standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment,
material and techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized
units.
      (Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1301.06 LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.
   The STBBC and all proceedings there under shall be liberally construed in
order to promote its purposes under Section
1301.05 and to avoid unnecessary hardship, provided the spirit and intent of
the STBBC shall be observed and the public safety, health and welfare is
assured.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1301.07 CONFLICT BETWEEN SPECIAL AND GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
   When a special provision is made in a use group classification of the STBBC
and is inconsistent with a general provision of STBBC relating to buildings
generally, the special provision governs, unless it appears that the provisions
are cumulative.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1301.08 VALIDITY.
        In the event any part or provision of STBBC is held to be illegal or
void, this shall not have the effect of making void or illegal any of the other
parts or provisions thereof, and it shall be presumed that STBBC would have
been adopted without such illegal or invalid parts or provisions.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1301.09 WHERE APPLICABLE.

regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the
rules of the Ohio Board of Building Standards. However, under Ohio R.C.
3781.12, authorization by the Ohio Board of Building Standards of any fixture,
device, material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or
method or manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for
their use anywhere in Ohio.

sizes. Wall materials shall be described by crosshatching with explanatory key,
by notation, or by other clearly understandable method. Spaces shall be
identified by code appellation, i.e. an "Auditorium" may not be identified as
"meeting room" if its size and function dictates that it is an auditorium.
      (5)   All elevations necessary to completely describe the exterior of the
building including floor to floor dimensions.
      (6)   Cross sections, wall sections and detail sections, to scale, as may
be required to describe the general building construction, and details which
may be necessary to describe typical connections, etc.
      (7)   Complete structural description of the building on the above
drawings or on separate drawings including size and location of all principal
structural elements and a table of live loads used in the design of the
building and computations, stress diagrams and other data sufficient to show
correctness of plans.
      (8)   Complete description of the mechanical and electrical systems of
the building on the above drawings or on separate drawings, including plumbing
schematics and principal plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning
duct and piping layouts and lighting and power equipment layouts. Plans for
buildings more than two stories in height shall indicate where penetrations
will be made for electrical, mechanical, plumbing and communications conduits,
pipes and systems and the materials and methods for maintaining the required
structural integrity, fire resistance rating and fire-stopping.
      (9)   Additional graphic or text information as may be reasonably
required by the Building Official to allow him to review special or
extraordinary construction methods or equipment.
   (e)   Specification Requirements. Each set of drawings submitted for a
permit shall be accompanied by a set of specifications describing all the
materials to be used and the work contemplated to be done. The specifications
shall be written in ink or typewritten or printed. The various subjects therein
shall be grouped in the order of their construction, and all matters relating
to the same subject shall be incorporated in that part of the specifications
devoted to that subject.
      (1)   Exception. Where in the opinion of the Building Official all
pertinent specification data necessary to determine compliance with STBBC are
adequately shown on the drawings, he may waive the requirement for submission
of the specifications.
   (f)   Responsibility for Plans. Required plans, when submitted for
inspection, shall bear the identification of the person primarily responsible
for their preparation and for the provisions for safety and sanitation shown
therein. The Building Official may require that the plans, structure, equipment
and/or service facilities or part thereof bear the seal of a professional
engineer or architect duly registered and authorized to practice his profession
in the State of Ohio. However, such requirement may be waived, whenever, in his
opinion, the protection of public health, safety and property do not require
that the design of any construction, repair, alteration, enlargement and/or
demolition of any building, structure, equipment and/or service facilities or
any part thereof be performed by an individual having qualifications as a
professional engineer or architect.
   (g)   Plans Review. The review of plans and specifications to determine
compliance with the provisions of STBBC shall be by a Plans Examiner meeting
the requirements of Section
1301.16(d)(3).
   (h)   Certification by an Architect or Engineer. Plans which have been
certified by the registered architect or professional engineer who prepared the
same as conforming to the requirements of STBBC pertaining to design loads,
stresses, strength and stability, or other requirements involving technical
analysis, need be examined by the Building Official only to the extent
necessary to determine conformity of such plans with other requirements of
STBBC.
   (i)   Certification for Automatic Sprinkler System. Plans and specifications
for automatic sprinkler systems shall:
      (1)   When submitted under the signature of an individual certified under
Ohio R.C. 3781.105, be processed in the same manner as plans and specifications
submitted under the signature of a professional engineer registered under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 4733 or an architect registered under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4703. Any
statistical data reports, explanations, plan description or information that
would not also be required for a similar submission by a professional engineer
or registered architect need not be submitted by a certified designer.
      (2)   If certified by a registered architect or professional engineer or
individual certified under Ohio R.C. 3781.105 as conforming to requirements of
STBBC pertaining to design loads, stresses, strength, stability or other
requirements involving technical analysis, be examined by the Building
Department official only to the extent necessary to determine conformity of
such plans and specifications with other requirements adopted by the Ohio Board
of Building Standards under Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791.
   (j)   Order of Action. All plans shall be examined in order of their
receipt, and no plan shall be acted on out of its regular order unless the work
involved is of a complex character which requires prolonged examination or
unless otherwise consented to by the building owner affected by deferred
examination of his application. Applications which are resumed without action
because of being incomplete or because of violations of some of the provisions
of STBBC shall be taken in order as the date of resubmission for approval.
   (k)   Plans Approval. When the Plans Examiner finds that plans submitted for
approval conform to the applicable provisions of STBBC, he shall endorse or
stamp such plans as approved.
   (l)   Non-conforming Plans. When plans are submitted which do not conform
with the requirements of STBBC such plans may be approved by the Building
Official provided such nonconformance does not consist of a condition
considered to be a serious hazard and the owner or his representative
subsequently submits revised plans, addenda or other data to show evidence of
compliance with the applicable provisions of STBBC. In the event such data is
not received within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed thirty days, the
Building Official shall revoke the plan approval.
   (m)   Conditional Plans. When plans are submitted which cannot be approved
under the provisions of subsections (k) and (l) hereof, the Building Official
may at the request of the owner or representative of the owner, issue a
conditional plan approval when an objection to any portion of the plans or
specifications results from conflicting interpretations of STBBC. No
conditional approval shall be issued where the objection is to the application
of specific technical requirements of STBBC or correction of the objection
would cause extensive changes in the building design or construction. A
conditional approval is a conditional license to obtain a conditional permit in
accordance with Section 
1305.03(c).
   (n)   Partial Plan Approval. The Building Official may issue a partial plan
approval for construction of a foundation or any other part of a building or
structure before complete plans and specifications for the entire building or
structure have been submitted, provided that such approvals are issued for
various stages in sequence of construction and that all information and data
required by STBBC for that portion of the building or structure has been
submitted.
   (o)   License Allowing Adjudication Hearing. The approval of plans under
this rule is a license and the failure to approve such plans as submitted
within thirty days after filing or the disapproval of such plans is an
adjudication order denying the issuance of a license requiring the opportunity
for an adjudication hearing as provided by Ohio R.C. 119.07 to 119.13 and as
modified by Ohio R.C. 3781.031 and 3781.19. An adjudication order denying the
issuance of a license shall specify the reasons for such denial.
   (p)   Imperfect Application, Drawings, Specifications or Statement. If the
application for a permit or the drawings, specifications, details or statement
accompanying the same indicate to the Building Official that the work to be
done is not clearly or specifically defined and or dimensioned or is imperfect,
or is not in all respects in accordance with the provisions of STBBC, he shall
refuse to issue a permit until such application, drawings, specifications,
details and statement shall have been made to conform in every respect with the
requirements thereof. All drawings which are not completely dimensioned or
which are illegible shall be deemed incomplete.
   (q)   Disposition of Plans. One set of plans and specifications approved
under subsection (k) hereof shall be retained in the Building Department. One
set of plans and specifications shall be resumed to the owner. One identical
set of plans shall be kept at the site of the work and shall be available for
reference by the Building Official at all times during working hours while such
work is in progress. The Building Official shall stamp or endorse additional
sets of plans which have been approved by him, when so requested by the owner
or his agent.
   (r)   Conformity to Plans. The construction, erection and alteration of a
building or other structure, and any addition thereto, and the equipment and
maintenance thereof, shall conform to the required plans which have been
approved by the Building Official, except for minor deviations which do not
involve a violation of STBBC.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.03 PERMIT ISSUANCE, SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   Action on Application. The Building Official shall examine or cause to
be examined all applications for permits and amendments thereto within a
reasonable time after filing. If the application or the plans do not conform to
the requirements of all pertinent laws, he shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefore. If he is satisfied that the proposed
work conforms to the requirements of STBBC, and all laws and ordinances
applicable thereto, he shall issue a permit therefore as soon as practicable.
   (b)   Prior Approval Required. No permit for the construction of any
building or addition shall be issued by the Building Official until applicable
approval from other departments has been obtained.
      (1)   Sewers. No permit for construction shall be issued until the
applicant has obtained review and approval from the Metropolitan Sewer District
of Greater Cincinnati for the installation of an adequate building sanitary
sewer (sewer lateral) and approval from the City Engineer for the installation
of an adequate building and parking area storm sewer.
      (2)   Construction water. No permit for the construction of any new
building shall be issued until approval has been obtained from the Water
Department for the use of construction water.
      (3)   Driveways. When the applicant applies for a building permit upon a
dedicated street where a driveway is to be constructed he shall obtain approval
from the City Engineer before a permit is issued to assure that no traffic
problem will be created and that construction of the driveway, curb, apron and
sidewalk on the street right of way meets the requirements of the Engineering
Department.
      (4)   Parking lots. No permit for the construction of any off-street
parking area greater than 1,500 square feet shall be issued until plans for
parking and drainage have been approved by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Water supply. No permit for the construction of any building shall
be issued except where adequate water supply and facilities for fire fighting
purposes are available, as determined by the Fire Chief. If the Building
Official finds upon inspection of any building under construction that adequate
water supply or facilities for fire fighting purposes, as determined by the
Fire Chief, are not being furnished as required, then the Building Official may
stop such construction and revoke the permit previously issued therefore until
such time as adequate water supply or facilities for fire fighting purposes, as
determined by the City of St. Bernard Fire Chief, are furnished.
      (6)   Fire safety. No permit for the construction of any building shall
be issued until plans for fire suppression systems, occupancy load, means of
egress and other fire safety items agreed on by the Building Official and Fire
Chief, have been approved by the fire safety official.
      (7)   Demolition. Before a structure can be demolished or removed, the
owner or agent shall notify all utilities having service connections within the
structure such as water, electric, gas, sewer and other connections. A permit
to demolish or remove a structure shall not be issued until a release is
obtained from the utilities, stating that their respective service connections
and appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, have been removed or
sealed and plugged in a safe manner.
      (8)   Industrialized units. Industrialized units are required to be
authorized by the Ohio Board of Building Standards prior to the issuance of a
building permit. All industrialized units shall meet the requirements of rules
4101:2-1-56 through 4101:2-1-65 of the Ohio Administrative Code.
   (c)   Conditional Permit.  A conditional permit may be issued when plans
have been approved under Sections
1305.02(l) and (m). A conditional permit is a conditional license to proceed
with construction or materials up to the point where plans are corrected or
construction or materials objected to by the Building Official are to be
incorporated into the building. No construction shall proceed beyond this point
until the objection is resolved.
   (d)   Partial Permit. A partial permit may be issued for that part of a
building where plans have been approved under Section
1305.02(n). The owner of a partial permit may proceed only to the point for
which approval has been given, at his own risk and without assurance that
approval for the entire building or structure will be granted.
   (e)   Violation. Except as provided in subsection (f) hereof, any person,
firm or corporation who performs work for which a permit is required by STBBC
without first having secured a permit therefor shall be deemed in violation of
STBBC and subject to the penalties provided by STBBC.
   (f)    Emergencies. In cases of emergency where there is actual and
immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or structure or the
existence of defective equipment or service facilities or a particularly
hazardous use such as to endanger life or health or such other condition as to
require immediate action to make repairs or corrections necessary to prevent
the occurrence of such failure to collapse or the occurrence of such danger and
time available is not sufficient to allow the securing of a permit from the
Building Official as required by STBBC, the person, firm or corporation
required to perform such repairs may proceed to do so after having first
notified the Building Official of such fact without obtaining a permit as
required by STBBC. In case the Building Official is unavailable, notice shall
be given to the nearest fire or police official.
   (g)   Failure to Obtain Permits Before Starting Work. Any person who
commences any installation of work for which a permit is required by STBBC,
without first having obtained a permit therefor shall, if legally authorized
and subsequently allowed to obtain a permit, pay the permit fees prescribed by
Section
1305.05(p), provided however, that this requirement shall not apply to
emergency work or installations as provided by subsection (f) hereof when it
shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Building Official that such work or
installation was urgently necessary and that it would have been impractical to
have awaited the normal time consumed in application for and issuance of the
permit. Nevertheless, even in such emergencies the required permit shall be
obtained without unreasonable delay after installation starts, and in no case
more than three days in which Village offices are open for business, or the
extra fee as herein provided shall be charged for the permit. Before issuing
such permit, the Building Official shall take necessary steps to determine
whether work performed prior to the date of permit and inspection conform to
STBBC. Such steps may include but shall not be limited to directing the tearing
out of sections of surface work for access to subsurface sections, digging for
access to foundations, piping and other subterranean work and the like. The
applicant for the permit shall perform all such work as may be directed at his
own expense.
   (h)   Suspension of Permit. Any permit issued shall become invalid if the
authorized work is not commenced within six months after issuance of the
permit, or if the authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of six
months after the time of commencing the work.
   (i)   Revocation of Permit. The Building Official may revoke any permit or
approval issued under the provisions of STBBC or may stop the work for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   Whenever there is a violation of any provision of STBBC, any
ordinance of the City or statute of the State relating to the same subject
matter;
      (2)   Whenever the continuance of any work becomes dangerous to life or
property;
      (3)   Whenever there is a violation of any condition on which the
issuance of the permit or approval was based;
      (4)   Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, plans or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based;
      (5)   When orders on a building have not been complied with or when the
building does not comply with the occupancy requirements;
      (6)   Whenever adequate water supply or facilities for fire fighting
purposes are not furnished as required in Section
1305.03(b)(6);
      (7)   Whenever in the opinion of the Building Official the person having
charge of the work is incompetent. The revocation notice of the permit in every
instance shall be in writing and shall be served upon the holder of the permit,
the owner, his agent, or the person having charge of the work. Any revocation
notice shall also be posted upon the building or structure in question by the
Building Official. After the notice is received or posted, no person shall
proceed with any operation for which such a permit was issued. No part of the
fees for such permit shall be resumed. Revocation of a permit shall be subject
to appeal to the Board as provided in Section 1305.17.
   (j)   Posting of Permit. The permit shall be posted in a conspicuous
location outside of the building and in the front part of the premises on which
is, or will be, located the building or equipment to which the approved plans
relate. The owner and the contractor shall, so far as possible, preserve and
keep such permit posted until the completion of the work to which the approved
plans relate. Upon application by the owner, the Building Official shall issue
a duplicate permit to replace one destroyed by vandals or one which is
accidentally destroyed.
   (k)   Notice of Start. At least twenty-four hours notice of start of work
under a building permit shall be given to the Building Official. (Ord. 15-2011.
Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.04 PERMIT CONDITIONS.
   (a) Payment of Fees. No permit shall be issued, and no amendment to a plan
application for permit, or other submission, shall be approved or certified,
until the fees prescribed in Section
1305.05 have been paid.
   (b)   Compliance With STBBC. A permit shall be an authorization to proceed
with the work, but shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or
set aside any of the provisions of City of St. Bernard Building Code (STBBC),
zoning laws or other applicable laws except as specifically allowed by lawfully
granted modification or deviation.
   (c)   Compliance With Permit. All work shall conform to the approved
application and plans for which the permit has been issued and any approved
amendments thereto.
   (d)   Compliance With Plot Plan. All new work shall be located strictly in
accordance with the approved plot and location plan.
   (e)   Change in Plot. No lot or plot shall be changed, increased or
diminished in area from that shown in the application for permit without first
amending the application to that effect, except where the change is caused by
reason of an official street opening, street widening or other public
improvement.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.05 FEES.
   (a)   General. A permit to begin work for new construction, alteration,
removal, demolition or other building operation shall not be issued until the
fees prescribed in this section have been paid to the Building Department or
other authorized City agency, nor shall an amendment to a permit necessitating
an additional fee be approved until the additional fee has been paid.
   (b) Special Fees. The payment of the fee for the construction, alteration,
removal or demolition of all work done in connection with or concurrently with
the work contemplated by a building permit, shall not relieve the applicant or
holder of the permit from the payment of other fees that may be prescribed by
law or ordinance for water taps, sewer connections, electrical permits,
erection of signs and display structures, marquees or other appurtenant
structures, or fees for inspection, certificate of use and occupancy or other
privileges or requirements, both within and without the jurisdiction of the
Building Department.
   (c)   Fees for Nonclassified Items. Where fees are not specifically
provided, they shall be assigned to that classification by the Building
Official as determined most reasonable and appropriate.
   (d)   Fees Based on Valuation. The cost as applicable to permit fees for new
buildings, additions, equipment and alterations and repairs to existing
buildings and equipment shall be based on the valuation of the buildings,
additions, equipment and alterations and repairs. The Building Official shall
have the right to verify and correct the estimated cost using generally
accepted methods of estimating such as those prescribed by the model code
organization, construction data services and similar agencies. Calculation of
the fees shall be in accordance with the fee schedules approved by Council and
posted on the Municipal official web site.
   (e)   Plan Examination Fees.  When plans are required, no application for a
permit shall be accepted for filing unless the applicant at the time of filing
pays the plan examination fee approved by the Planning Commission and Council
and posted on the St. Bernard web site. Plan examination fees shall be based on
the estimated cost of the work, as shown on the application; shall be in
addition to the payment of the regular permit fee and any other fee which may
accrue thereafter; and no portion of such plan examination fee shall be
refunded.
   (f)   Blocking Streets and Sidewalks. The Director of Public Service and
Safety shall determine whether permission can be granted for the temporary
blocking or use of streets, sidewalks, alleys or other public rights of way or
for the purpose of construction, depositing material or placing equipment
thereon or for other purposes.
   (g)   Work Performed on Village Right of Way. The permit fee for inspection
of work performed on Village right of way shall be for inspection only and
apply for either new installation or replacement. All material or labor shall
be furnished by the contractor. Where any combination of sidewalk, driveway
across Village property, curb cut and apron are inspected at the same time, a
charge will be made for only that item having the maximum fee.
   Before a permit is issued, the contractor shall give bond to the Village in
the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) conditioned to repair paving if
improperly laid. A property owner may provide an approved certificate allowing
for a lien against the property in lieu of a bond.
   (h)   Commencing Work Prior to Permit Issuance. Where the work for which a
permit is required by STBBC is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining
such permit, the permit fine hereinafter specified may, at the discretion of
the Building Official or the Director of Public Service and Safety, be imposed
at three times the amount of the permit fee, plus the cost of the permit fee.
The total cost of the permit shall be the permit fee and the permit penalty. A
maximum one thousand dollars ($1,000) penalty may apply. A second offense by
the same applicant within any twelve month period may constitute doubling all
minimum and maximum penalty fees. The payment of such penalty fees shall not
relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of the STBBC in
the execution of the work, nor from any other penalty prescribed herein.
   (i)   Revised and Addendum Plans. In the event substitute or revised plans
or an addendum to the original plan is submitted for a building or site on
which a permit has been requested, an additional permit shall be obtained for
each such change and/or addition. Minor addendum plans that do not alter space
or change structural requirements may be charged for the hourly time of review,
with a one-half hour minimum.
   (j)   Expiration and Renewal of Permits. Upon expiration of a permit, no
work shall be permitted until the permit is renewed, for which renewal a fee
shall be charged based on the cost of the unfinished work.
   (k)   Cancellation and Refunds. Upon written request, prior to commencement
of any work, permits may be canceled by the holder, and part of the permit fee
will be refunded in accordance with the fee schedule.
   (l)   Work Performed In-House by Schools.
      (1)   "School" for purposes of this chapter, is defined as any
institution regulated by the State Board of Education or the State Department
of Education pursuant to the authority granted by Ohio R.C. 3301.07, 3301.71,
and 3301.53.
      (2)   Schools shall pay one dollar ($1.00) for building permits for work
performed in house by School.

1305.06 INSPECTIONS.
   (a) Preliminary Inspection. Before issuing a permit, the Building Official
may examine or cause to be examined all buildings, structures and sites for

repair, remove, demolish or change the use thereof.
   (b)   Required Inspections. After issuing a building permit, the Building
Official shall conduct such inspections from time to time during and upon
completion of the work for which a permit has been issued. A record of all such
examinations and inspections and of all violations of STBBC, shall be
maintained by the Building Official.
   (c)   Lot Line Markers Required. Before any work is started in the
construction of a new principal building, major addition to a building, a new

permanent markers or with markers which are offset at a distance which is of
record with the owner.
   (d)   Notice.  It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to notify the
Building Official when work is ready for the various inspections required by
the terms of the permit or the approved rules. Such notice shall be given
within a reasonable time from which such inspection is desired but in no event
shall be less than twenty-four hours. Notice given on a Friday or on a day
prior to a legal holiday shall not constitute notice for inspection on a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday unless arrangements have been made under approved
rules for inspection on such days. Before giving such notice the permittee
shall first test the work and satisfy himself that it conforms to the approved
plans and specifications and the requirements of STBBC.
   (e)   Action on Notice. Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for
inspection the Building Official shall inspect or cause it to be inspected as
soon as is reasonably practicable, however, failure of the Building Official to
make a prompt inspection shall not be deemed justification for covering work
without inspection when such work is required under the terms of the permit to
be inspected before being covered.
   (f)   Covering Work. It shall be a violation of STBBC to cover prior to
inspection any work required to be inspected under the provisions of a permit,
the approved rules, or STBBC irrespective of any penalties for such violation.

point of manufacture of fabrication in accordance with subsection (o) hereof
and the OBC. The cost of all such inspections shall be borne by the applicant
therefor.
   (j)   Inspection Reports. All inspection reports shall be in writing and
shall be certified by the licensed authority, or responsible officer of the
agency, or the individual when expert inspection services are accepted. An
identifying label or stamp permanently affixed to the product indicating that
factory inspection has been made shall be accepted in lieu of the aforesaid
inspection report in writing if the intent or meaning of such identifying label
or stamp is properly substantiated.
   (k)   Final Inspection. Upon completion of the building or structure, and
before issuance of the certificate of use and occupancy required in Section
1305.08, a final inspection shall be made. All violations of the approved plans
and permit shall be noted and the permittee shall be notified of the
discrepancies.
   (l)   Right of Entry. In the discharge of duties, the Building Official or
an authorized representative shall have the authority to enter at any
reasonable hour any building, structure or premises in the jurisdiction to
enforce the provisions of STBBC, except that no such employee shall enter a
part of a building which is "private" and occupied as such, as defined in
Section

his permission to enter such private part of the building. Such requirement
does not apply where a state of emergency exists.
   (m)   Credentials. Before entering upon a premises or while on a premises in
the performance of his duties in the enforcement of STBBC, an employee of the
Building Department shall show his credentials upon request by the owner of the
premises involved or by the contractor performing work on such premises.
   (n)   Jurisdictional Cooperation.  The assistance and cooperation of the
Police, Fire and Health Departments and all other officials shall be available
as required in the performance of duties.

1305.08 CERTIFICATES OF USE AND OCCUPANCY. 
   (a)   New Buildings. A building or structure hereafter erected shall not be
used, occupied or rented in whole or in part until a certificate of use and
occupancy for each unit has been issued by the Building Official.
   (b)   Buildings Hereafter Altered. A building or structure hereafter
enlarged, extended or altered, in whole or in part, shall not be used, occupied
or rented until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued; except that
any use or occupancy for which a certificate had previously been issued, which
was not discontinued during the work of alteration shall require the issuance
of a certificate by the Building Official within thirty days after completion
of the work of alteration.
   (c)   Changes in Use. A building or structure hereafter changed, in whole or
in part, from one use group to another, or to a different use within the same
use group, shall not be occupied or rented for the new use until:
      (1)   The building conforms to the applicable provisions of the STBBC for
the new use; and
      (2)   A Certificate of Use and Occupancy has been issued by the Building
Official for each unit of such changed portions.

permit, the Building Official may issue a Temporary Certificate of Use and
Occupancy, before the entire work covered by the permit has been completed, for
those units of a building or structure without endangering life or public
welfare.
   (f)   Fee. The fee for a Certificate of Use and Occupancy and Temporary
Certificates of Use and Occupancy required by the STBBC shall be as posted on

hereafter shall become unsafe, unsanitary, or deficient in adequate exitway
facilities, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to
human life or the public welfare, or which by reason of illegal or improper
use, occupancy or maintenance, shall be deemed unsafe buildings or structures.
All unsafe structures shall be taken down and removed or made safe and secure,
as the Building Official may deem necessary and as provided in this section. A
vacant building, unguarded or open at door or window, shall be deemed a fire
hazard and unsafe within the meaning of STBBC.
   
   (b)   Examination and Record of Damaged Structure. The Building Official
shall examine every building or structure reported as dangerous, unsafe
structurally or constituting a fire hazard; and he shall cause the report to be
filed in a docket of unsafe structures and premises, stating the use of the
structure, the nature and estimated amount of damages, if any, caused by
collapse or failure.
   (c)   Notice. If an unsafe condition is found in a building or structure,
the Building Official shall serve on the owner, agent or person in control of
the building or structure a written notice describing the building or structure
deemed unsafe and specifying the required repairs or improvements to be made to
render the building or structure safe and secure, or requiring the unsafe
building or structure or portion thereof to be demolished within a stipulated
time. Action on any violation shall be in accordance with Section
1305.10.
   (d)   Restoration. A building or structure condemned by the Building
Official may be restored to safe condition provided change of use or occupancy
is not contemplated or compelled by reason of such reconstruction or
restoration; except that if the damage or cost of reconstruction or restoration

foundations, such structure shall be made to comply in all respects with the
requirements for materials and methods of construction of structures hereafter
erected.
   (e)   Placarding. In every case the Building Official shall placard the
unsafe structure or premises in accordance with the requirements of Section

structure which may be affected by the condition responsible for such order,
and shall request that service being furnished the building or structure by
such utility be discontinued when in his opinion the continuance of such
service will constitute a hazard to the public. Upon receipt of the copy of
notice and the request thereon, any person, firm, association and the like
supplying such service shall promptly discontinue its supply at the meter in
the designated portion of the building or structure. No person, firm or
association shall thereafter continue or restore such service until furnished

(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.13 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   (a) Vacating Structures. When the Building Official determines that there is
actual and immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or structure or
any part thereof or the existence of defective equipment or service facilities
such as to endanger life or health, or when any structure or part of a
structure has fallen or failed and use or occupancy of the structure,
equipment, service facility and/or equipment or part thereof would, in his
opinion, endanger life or health or where there is a particularly hazardous use
of the building or structure such as to endanger life or health, the Building
Official is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants
and tenants to vacate the same forthwith, and/or to immediately cease, and
refrain from use or operation of the building, structure, equipment, service
facility or part thereof which is deemed dangerous or to cease such hazardous
use. The Building Official shall placard the building, structure or premises in
accordance with the procedures of Section
1305.11. No person shall enter such building, structure or premises except for
the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the same.
   (b)   Temporary Safeguards. When the Building Official determines that an
emergency exists such that there is actual and immediate danger of collapse or
failure of a building or structure or any part thereof which would endanger
life, the Building Official shall cause the necessary work to be done to render
such building or structure or part thereof temporarily safe. Prior to any work
being done to the building or structure, the Building Official shall give
notice to the owner and lien holders of record advising them of his intention
to make the building or structure temporarily safe.
   (c)   Closing Streets. When necessary for the public safety, the Building

Official shall employ the necessary labor and materials to perform the required
work as expeditiously as possible.
   (e)   Costs of Emergency Repairs. Costs incurred in the performance of

Official. The Law Director shall institute appropriate action against the owner
of the premises where the unsafe building, structure, equipment or service
facility is or was located for the recovery of such costs in the manner
provided by Section
1305.10(k).
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.14 VACATIONS.
   (a)   General. The Building Official shall be authorized to order any
building or portion of any building vacated, or if it is vacant to remain
vacated for any of the reasons specified as follows:
      (1)   STBBC violation. When a building is occupied, or any work,
operation or construction is performed therein or thereon in violation of any
of the provisions of STBBC.
      (2)   Unsafe or insanitary building. When the Building Official
determines that the building is unsafe or insanitary.
      (3)   Noncompliance. When the owner, agent or tenant fails or refuses to
comply with any lawful order issued by the Building Official.
   (b)   Notices to Vacate. Every order to vacate shall be in writing and shall
be served upon the owner, agent or tenant, stating the reason for the order to
vacate and directing that the building or portion of the building, if it is
occupied, be vacated by a specified time.
   (c)   Placarding of Structure. After the notice to vacate required under the
provisions of STBBC has resulted in an order by virtue of failure to comply
within the time given, the Building Official may post on the premises or
structure or parts thereof, or on defective equipment, a placard in accordance
with the provisions of Section
1305.11.
   (d)   Closing of Vacant Structure. If the structure or part thereof is
vacant and unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Building Official may post a placard of condemnation
on the premises and may order the structure closed up so it will not be an
attractive nuisance to youngsters. Upon failure of the owner to close up the
premises within the time specified in the order, the Building Official shall
cause it to be closed through any available public agency or by contract or
arrangement by private persons. Costs incurred by the Building Official shall
be paid by the Treasurer on his certification and the costs recovered in the
manner provided by Section
1305.10(k).
   (e)   Prohibited Use. When any person, being the owner, agent or having
control of a building, structure or dwelling unit fails to comply with an order
of vacation issued by the Building Official and either occupies or allows the
building, structure or dwelling unit to be occupied by persons other than
himself, such person shall be in violation of Section
1305.14(a), unless he can show by preponderance of the evidence that the
property is being occupied without his knowledge or consent. Proper service of
an eviction notice    or the good faith maintenance of forcible entry and
detained proceedings against occupants shall be prima-facie evidence of lack of
knowledge and consent. Any person who occupies a placarded premises or
structure or part thereof, or uses placarded equipment, and any owner or any
person responsible for the premises who lets anyone occupy a placarded premises
shall be liable for the penalties provided by Section 1305.99.
   (f)   Rescinding Order to Vacate. The Building Official shall rescind the
order to vacate and remove the placard whenever the defect or defects upon
which the vacating and placarding action were based have been eliminated.
     
   (g)   Vacant Building Structure Declared a Public Nuisance. Buildings which
remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of time become an
attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an invitation to
derelicts, vagrants and criminals as a temporary abode, and an increased fire
hazard and the unkept grounds surrounding such property invite the dumping of
garbage and rubbish thereon. Such buildings are permitted to become dilapidated
since such buildings are often economically obsolete and the owners of such
buildings are unwilling to expend the necessary funds to repair or raze the
building; such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within the Village,
depress market values of surrounding properties and require additional
governmental services. The use and maintenance of property in such condition
and manner endangers the public safety and health constitutes an unreasonable
use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort and repose of a considerable
number of the public, is detrimental to the public good and to the common
welfare, and renders a considerable number of the public insecure in the use
and enjoyment of their property, and thus may constitute a nuisance condition.
   (h)   Nuisance Condition Defined. A building within the Village shall be
deemed a nuisance condition if:
      (1)   It is vacant and unoccupied for the purpose for which it was
erected and for which purpose a certificate of occupancy may have been issued;
and
      (2)   The building is unfit for occupancy as it fails to meet the minimum
standards set out by Village ordinances before a certificate of occupancy can
be granted, or is unfit for human habitation because it fails to meet the
minimum standards set out in the St. Bernard Property Maintenance Code (NPMC),
or the doors, windows and other openings into the building are boarded up or
otherwise secured by a means other than the conventional methods used in the
original construction and design of the building; and,
      (3)   The building has remained substantially in such condition for a
period of at least nine months. When it is determined by the Building Official
and the Fire Chief that a building constitutes an immediate hazard to the
public health and safety, and after approval by Council the nine month waiting
period set out in this section may be waived and the other procedures, as set
out in this chapter, may be implemented immediately.
   (i)   Demolition of Nuisance Building. Vacant buildings or structures,
determined to be a public nuisance by the Building Official may be demolished
in accordance with procedures of Section
1305.15.
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.15 DEMOLITION.
   (a) The Building Official may order the owner of premises upon which is
located any structure or part thereof to raze and remove such structure or part
thereof for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   When the Building Official determines that the structure or any
part thereof is in an advanced state of disrepair and endangers the health and
safety of the public or is otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or
use, so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same;
      (2)   It is a vacant building declared to be a public nuisance in
accordance with Section
1305.14(g);
      (3)   Construction was not in accordance with approved plans or without a
building permit or after issuance of a stop work order; or
      (4)   Where there has been a cessation of normal construction of any
structure for a period of more than nine months.
   (b)    Whenever the Building Official determines that the cost of such
repairs would exceed sixty percent (60%) of the current value of such
structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed
for the purpose of this section that such structure is a public nuisance which
may be ordered razed and removed.
   (c)   Initial orders shall be in accordance with Section
1305.10(b). Failure to comply with the orders within the specified time shall
allow the Building Official to issue an order in accordance with Section
1305.10(f). The Building Official may, upon good cause shown, allow the owner
such additional time as may be necessary to abate the unsafe nuisance
condition.
   (d)   The Building Official shall be authorized to take the following steps:
      (1)   At least thirty days prior to the demolition of the building or
structure, the Building Official shall notify all owners and lien holders of
record of the property by certified mail, return receipt requested, priority
mail with delivery confirmation, by publication at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation in St. Bernard, and by posting a notice in a conspicuous
place upon the building or structure.
      (2)   Not less than thirty days after the notification as set forth in
subsection (d)(1) hereof, enter upon the premises concerned with sufficient
force to take down and remove the subject building or structure.
      (3)   Demolish the building or structure and certify the costs incurred
to the Treasurer for payment. The demolition shall include all debris removal,
backfilling and grading of the premises.
   (e)   When any structure has been razed and removed by the Village, Council
or a duly authorized officer under contract or arrangement may sell the salvage
and materials in the following manner:
      (1)   Notice of the sale shall be given by published advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation in St. Bernard once a week for three
consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale.
      (2)   All such sales shall be public sales/auctions.
      (3)   The net proceeds of the sale, after deducting the expenses of
razing and removing such structure and advertising and sales expenses, shall be
remitted to the owners and lien holders of record in order of priority, subject
to any order of the court. A report of the sale, including the items of expense
and the amounts deducted shall be remitted with the net surplus. If such a
surplus does not remain, the report of the sale shall so state.
   (f)   The Law Director, at the request of the Building Official, may
institute proceedings to recover the total cost in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1305.10(k).
(Ord. 15-2011. Passed 3-17-11.)
1305.16 REMOVAL OF UNLAWFUL SIGNS.
   Should any sign be installed, erected or maintained in violation of any of
the provisions of STBBC, the Building Official shall notify forthwith the
owner, occupant or person in charge of property on which the sign is situated,
by certified mail, sent to the last known address of the person to be notified
or by personal service, to remove such sign within seventy-two hours from the
date of such notice. In the event of noncompliance with such notice, the
Building Official shall cause the sign to be removed. Costs incurred shall be
paid by the City Treasurer and the Law Director shall institute such action as
may be appropriate to recover such costs from the owner in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1305.10(k).

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1331.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of St. Bernard, Ohio, does ordain as follows: (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-
19-24.)
1331.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of St. Bernard has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted. (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of St. Bernard as identified in Section
1331.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by St.
Bernard. (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Hamilton County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas both effective February 16, 2012.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by St. Bernard as required by Section
1331.63 Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall for the Village of St. Bernard, located at
110 Washington Avenue, St. Bernard, Ohio, 45217.
(Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of St. Bernard, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-29-24.)
1331.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
 
1331.20 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
      Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community
depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
      An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of
special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones
      Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the
flood hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone
definitions:
      Zone A:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; base flood elevations are not determined.

depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than
one (1) square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
      Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
      The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood
profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   Floodproofing
      Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation
      The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus
one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway
      A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard
      A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure
      Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of St. Bernard7's historic preservation program, which program
is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
      An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State
of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
      A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
         A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends
the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific
property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
         A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and
floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a
LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded
from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
         A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon
construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding
source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway,
the effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR
does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor
      The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home
      A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park
      As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   (z)   Mean sea level
      For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   (aa)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
      The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (bb)   New construction
      Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after
the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by St. Bernard and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [September 19, 1984] or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (cc)   Person
      Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code
§111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (dd)   Recreational vehicle
      A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be
self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Architect 
      A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to
Ohio Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Engineer
      A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Surveyor
      A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
   (hh)   Special Flood Hazard Area
      Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH,
AO, A1 30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (ii)    Start of construction
      The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)   Structure
      A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   Substantial Damage
      Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   (ll)   Substantial Improvement
      Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (mm)   Variance
      A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   (nn)   Violation
      The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with these regulations.
      (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)

1331.42 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1331.80, Appeals and Variances.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development. (Ord.

1331.43 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (a)   Zone A:
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1331.69(b) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C, and X:
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which
are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are encouraged to
reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that the health,
safety, and property of their citizens are protected.

hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1331.69(a)(2), items A. and C.-E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a

presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with St.
Bernard specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1331.41(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts. (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)

a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1331.84(c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 38-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1331.85 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.

time after the hearing.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
 
1335.01 GENERAL.
   (a)   Title.  These regulations shall be known as the Property Maintenance
Code of the City of St. Bernard, hereinafter referred to as the Property
Maintenance Code or "this code."
   (b)   Scope. This code is to protect the public health, safety and welfare
in all existing structures, residential and nonresidential, and on all existing
premises as hereinafter provided, by:
      (1)   Establishing minimum maintenance standards for all structures and
premises for basic equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space
heating and sanitation; for safety from fire; for space, use and location; and
for safe and sanitary maintenance of all structures and premises now in
existence;
      (2)   Fixing the responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of
all structures; and
      (3)   Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
   (c)   Intent. This code shall be construed liberally and justly to insure
public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the
maintenance of structures and premises.
   (d)   Other Regulations. The provisions in this code shall not be construed
to prevent the enforcement of other ordinances or regulations which prescribe
standards other than are provided herein.
   (e)   Application of Building Code. Any repairs or alterations to a
structure, or changes of use therein, which may be caused directly or
indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall be done in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of the Building Code.
   (f)   Existing Remedies. The provisions in this code shall not be deemed to
abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or
agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any buildings which are
deemed to be dangerous, unsafe, or unsanitary.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1335.02 VALIDITY.
   (a)   Validity. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of this code shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such
decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this code which shall
continue in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of this code
are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)   Saving Clause. This code shall not affect violations of any other
ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date hereof, and
any such violation shall be governed and shall continue to be punishable to the
full extent of the law under the provisions of those ordinances, codes or
regulations in effect at the time the violation was committed.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1335.03 EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   As provided in Section
1335.01, this code establishes minimum requirements for the initial and
continued occupancy and use of all structures and premises and does not replace
or modify requirements otherwise established by ordinance which may be
additional or more stringent for the construction, repair, alteration, or use
of structures, equipment or facilities.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1335.04 ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Officer. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the code official
to enforce the provisions of this code as herein provided.
   (b)   Jurisdiction. The Fire Chief or his authorized representative shall
have concurrent jurisdiction, powers and duties, as the Code Official with
respect to application and enforcement of Code Sections
1335.71 through
1335.75  “Fire Safety Requirements” and Code Sections 
1335.81 through
1335.84  “Fire Warning Systems”.
   (c)   Relief from Personal Liability. Any code official, officer or employee
who acts in good faith and without malice in the discharge of his duties of
enforcement of this code is relieved of all personal liability for any damage
that may accrue to persons or property as a result of such acts or alleged
failure to act. Further, he shall not be held liable for any costs in any
action, suit or proceeding that may be instituted by him in the enforcement of
this code. In any of these actions, the official or employee shall be defended
or represented by the jurisdiction's attorney-at-law until the final
termination of the proceedings.
   (d)   Official Records. An official record shall be kept of all business and
activities of the department specified in the provisions of this code, and all
such records shall be open to public inspection at all appropriate times and
under reasonable regulations established by the code official to maintain the
integrity and security of such records.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1335.05 DUTIES AND POWERS OF CODE OFFICIAL.
   (a)   General. The code official shall enforce all the provisions of this
code relative to the maintenance of structures and premises, except as may
otherwise be specifically provided for by other regulations.
   (b)   Notices and Orders. The code official shall issue all necessary
notices and orders to abate illegal or unsafe conditions to insure compliance
with the code requirements for the safety, health, and general welfare of the
public.
   (c)   Inspections. In order to safeguard the safety, health and welfare of
the public, the code official is authorized to enter any structure or premises
at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections and performing his
duties under this code.
      (1)   Right of Entry. If any owner, occupant, or other person in charge
of a structure subject to the provisions of this code refuses, impedes,
inhibits, interferes with, restricts, or obstructs entry and free access to any
part of the structure or premises where inspection authorized by this code is
sought, the administrative authority may seek, in a court of competent
jurisdiction, an order that such owner, occupant, or other person in charge
cease and desist with such interference.
      (2)   Access by Owner or Operator. Every occupant of a structure or
premises shall give the owner or operator thereof, or his agent or employee,
access to any part of such structure or its premises at reasonable times for
the purpose of making such inspection, maintenance, repairs, or alterations as
are necessary to comply with the provisions of this code.
   (d)   Credentials. The code official or his authorized representative shall
disclose proper credentials of his respective office for the purpose of
inspecting any and all buildings and premises in the performance of his duties
under this code.
   (e)   Coordination of Enforcement. Inspection of premises, the issuance of
notices and orders and enforcement thereof shall be the responsibility of code
officials so charged by the jurisdiction. Whenever, in the opinion of a code
official initiating an inspection under this code, it is deemed necessary or
desirable to have inspections by any other department, he shall make reasonable
effort to arrange for the coordination of such inspections so as to minimize
the number of visits by inspectors, and to confer with the other departments
for the purpose of eliminating conflicting orders before any are issued. A
department shall not, however, delay the issuance of any emergency orders which
it determines must be issued.
   (f)   Rule Making Authority. The code official shall have power as may be
necessary in the interest of public safety, health and general welfare, to
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to interpret and implement the
provisions of this code to secure the intent thereof and to designate
requirements applicable because of local climatic or other conditions; but such
rules shall not have the effect of waiving working stresses or fire protection
requirements specifically provided in this code or violating accepted
engineering practice involving public safety.
   (g)   Annual Report. At least annually, the code official shall submit to
the chief authority of the jurisdiction a written statement of operations in
the form and content as shall be prescribed by such authority.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1335.06 CONDEMNATION.
   (a)   General. When a structure or part thereof is found by the code
official to be unsafe, or when a structure or part thereof is found unfit for
human occupancy or use, or is found unlawful, it may be condemned pursuant to
the provisions of this code and may be placarded and vacated. It shall not be
re-occupied without the approval of the code official. Unsafe equipment shall
be placarded and placed out of service.
      (1)   An unsafe structure is one in which all or part thereof is found to
be dangerous to life, health, property, or the safety of the public or its
occupants because it is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe,
or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation that it is likely to
partially or completely collapse.
      (2)   Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment, elevator,
moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers or
other equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such
disrepair or condition that it is found to be a hazard to life, health,
property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or structure.
Unsafe equipment may contribute to the finding that the structure is unsafe or
unfit for human occupancy or use.
      (3)   A structure is unfit for human occupancy or use whenever the
codeofficial finds that it is unsafe, unlawful, or because of the degree in
which it lacks maintenance or is in disrepair, is unsanitary, vermin or rodent
infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination,
sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this
code, or because its location constitutes a hazard to its occupants or to the
public.
      (4)   An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be
occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or was erected,
altered or occupied contrary to law.
   (b)   Closing of Vacant Structures. If the structure or part thereof is
vacant and unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the code official may post a placard of condemnation on
the premises and may order the structure closed up so it will not be an
attractive nuisance to youngsters. Upon failure of the owner to close up the
premises within the time specified in the order, the code official shall cause
it to be closed through any available public agency or by contract or
arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against
the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon
such real estate.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)

building affected.
   (b) Whenever a person violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions
of this Chapter, the Building Code Official shall have the authority to impose
an administrative penalty. The Building Code Official shall consider the
following criteria in assessing an administrative penalty:

this Chapter;
      (2)   The degree of harm to the public health, safety, welfare and
aesthetics as a result of the violation of this Chapter;

therefore in the manner prescribed below. If he has condemned the property or
part thereof, he shall give notice to the owner and to the occupants of his

      (5)   Include an explanation of the owner's right to seek modification or
withdrawal of the notice by petition to an appeals board or appropriate review
board.
   (f)   Service. Such service shall be deemed to be properly served upon such
owner if a copy thereof is delivered to him personally; or by leaving the
notice at the ususal place of abode, in the presence of someone in the family
of suitable age and discretion who shall be informed of the contents thereof;
or by certified or registered mail addressed to the owner at his last known
address with return receipt requested; or if the certified or registered letter
is returned with receipt showing that it has not been delivered, by posting a
copy thereof in a conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such
notice.
   (g)   Service on Occupant.  When a condemnation order is served on an
occupant other than the owner or person responsible for such compliance, a
reasonable time to vacate the property after non-compliance shall be stated.
Owners or persons responsible for compliance shall vacate at the time set for
correction of defects if there is failure of compliance.
   (h)   Penalties. Penalties for noncompliance of orders and notices shall be
subject to the penalties set forth in Section
1335.10.

dwelling unit or structure who has received a compliance order or upon whom a
notice of violation has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or
otherwise dispose of to another until the provisions of the compliance order or
notice of violation have been complied with, or until such owner shall first
furnish the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any
compliance order or notice of violation issued by the code official and shall
furnish to the code official a signed and notarized statement from the grantee,
transferee, mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such compliance
order or notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility without
condition for making the corrections or repairs required by such compliance
order or notice of violation.
(Ord. 31-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)

comply within the time given, the code official may post on the premises or
structure or parts thereof, or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the
words: “Condemned as Unfit for Human Occupancy or Use”, and a statement of the
penalties provided for any occupancy or use or for removing the placard. The

1335.12 DEMOLITION.
   (a)   General. The code official may order the owner of premises upon which
is located any structure or part thereof, which in his judgment is so old,
dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe,
unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and so
that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, to raze and remove such
structure or part thereof; or if it can be made safe by repairs to repair and
make safe and sanitary or to raze and remove at the owner's option; or where
there has been a cessation of normal construction of any structure for a period
of more than two years, to raze and remove such structure or part thereof.
   (b)   Unreasonable Repairs. Whenever the code official determines that the
cost of such repairs would exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the current
value of such structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it
shall be presumed for the purpose of this section that such structure is a
public nuisance which may be ordered razed without option on the part of the
owner to repair.
   (c)   Order. The order shall specify a time in which the owner shall comply
therewith and specify repairs, if any. It shall be served on the owner of
record or his agent where an agent is in charge of the building and upon the
holder of any encumbrance of record in the manner provided for service of a
summons by a court of record. If the owner or a holder of an encumbrance of
record can not be found, the order may be served by posting it on the main
entrance of the building and by publishing it once each week for three
successive weeks in a newspaper authorized to provide service by publication.
   (d)   Restraining Actions. Anyone affected by any such order shall within
twenty days after service of such order apply to a court of record for an order
restraining the code official from razing and removing such structure or parts
thereof. The court shall determine whether the order of the code official is
reasonable, and if found reasonable the court shall dissolve the restraining
order, and if found not reasonable the court shall continue the restraining
order or modify it as the circumstances may require.
   (e)   Failure to Comply. Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply
with a demolition order within the time prescribed, the code official shall
cause the structure or part thereof to be razed and removed, either through an
available public agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and
the cost of such razing and removal shall be charged against the real estate
upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
   (f)   Salvage Materials. When any structure has been ordered razed and
removed the governing body or other designated officer under said contract or
arrangement aforesaid may sell the salvage and valuable materials at the
highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the
expenses of such razing and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report
of such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and the amounts
deducted, for the use of the person who may be entitled thereto, subject to any
order of a court. If such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the
report shall so state.

1340.01 PURPOSE.
   This Chapter is adopted to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant residential, commercial, and industrial buildings within the
Village of St. Bernard that may present a fire hazard, that may provide
temporary occupancy by transients, that may detract from private and/or public
efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and that may present
a hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
   Through a registration, inspection, and monitoring process, vacant
residential, commercial, and industrial buildings will be kept weather tight
and secure from trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and
firefighters in times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public
efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings and will not
otherwise present a public hazard, so that the health, safety and welfare of
the public is served by these regulations.

monitoring the Vacant Property; (iii) St. Bernard's costs to secure the Vacant
Property; and (iv) the demolition, hazard abatement and repair costs St.
Bernard incurs with respect to the Vacant Property. The progressive fee
structure, set forth in subsection A below, for properties that continue to be

dollars ($400.00) for the first year the property remains vacant. For every

shall be assessed at double the previous year's registration fee amount up to a
maximum annual registration fee equaling the five (5) year registration fee of
six thousand four hundred dollars ($6,400.00), which shall be the registration
fee for the fifth and all subsequent years of vacancy. The registration fee is
based on the duration of time the property has been vacant, regardless of a
change in ownership.
   (b)   The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the Vacant Property is
registered. If the fee is not paid, the owner shall be subject to application
penalties, as outlined in Section
1340.99 of this Chapter.
    (c)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the Vacant Property is granted an exemption pursuant to Section
1340.07 of this Chapter.
   (d)   The fee shall be prorated by day and a refund may be issued as set
forth in Section
1340.06 of this chapter if the Vacant Property is no longer deemed vacant under
the provisions of this Chapter.
   (e)   All delinquent fees shall be paid by the Owner prior to any transfer
of ownership over the Vacant Property.
   (f)   All delinquent fees shall be paid in full prior to transfer or
connection of any and all Village utilities.

will be equal to one- fourth of the applicable annual fee.
   (h)   Fees incurred prior to the enactment of this Chapter will be assessed
pursuant to the ordinance then in effect at the time the fees were incurred.
   If an Owner or Person in Control of a Vacant Property fails, neglects or
refuses to pay a registration fee within the time ordered pursuant to this
section, the designated administrator of the registry shall notify St.
Bernard's Auditor. St. Bernard's Auditor shall certify the registration fee to
the County Auditor who shall place the costs as a charge upon the tax list and
duplicate to be paid as a special assessment on the Vacant Property. In
addition to the registration fee, an interest rate equal to the current rate of
interest charged by St. Bernard on special assessments shall be imposed by St.
Bernard for the life of the registration fee and collected as provided in this
section.
(Ord. 30-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1340.06 REFUNDING OF FEES.
   St. Bernard shall refund the Vacant Property registration fee paid if the
subject property is brought into compliance with the applicable standards set
forth in all State and St Bernard Housing Codes, Building Codes and Property
Maintenance Codes, and is reoccupied within one (1) year of payment of the
annual registration fee. The refund shall be prorated by day for the fee paid
during the calendar year in which the Vacant Property was brought into
compliance with the aforementioned codes and reoccupied. Registration fees paid
in previous years shall not be refunded.
(Ord. 30-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1340.07 PROPERTIES EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Property under active construction or renovation and having a valid
building permit(s) shall be exempt from registration for a period of one (1)
year from the date that the first building permit is issued unless a good cause
exemption is granted by the Fire Chief.
   (b)   Property which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by extreme
weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a
period of ninety (90) days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event,
contingent on the Owner submitting a request for the exemption in writing to
the Fire Chief. This request shall include the names and addresses of the Owner
(s), and a statement of intent to repair and reoccupy the property in an
expedient manner, or of intent to demolish the building or other structure on
the property.
 
   (c)   Property that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of Ohio

Bernard; and

and structures on the property; (ii) whether the property is safe for entry by
firefighters and police officers in times of emergency; and (iii) whether the

property, an escrow account shall be established by either party or both
parties to the property transaction. The escrow amount shall contain an amount

parties to the transaction shall provide St. Bernard with proof of compliance

   The escrow account provided for in this Section

closed after the Owner, Authorized Agent and/or Person in Charge receives
written authorization from the Fire Chief to close the account.

written acknowledgment by the Owner, Authorized Agent and/or Person in Charge
of all outstanding violations on the Vacant Property and agreement to correct
such violations within six (6) months of the date the certificate of occupancy
is issued.
   The certificate of occupancy shall also be contingent upon the Owner,
Authorized Agent and/or Person in Charge establishing an escrow account
pursuant to Section
1340.12. Written notice of compliance with Section
1340.12 must be received by the Fire Chief prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. (Ord. 30-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1340.14 DISPERSAL OF FUNDS BY ESCROW AGENTS.
   No person acting in the capacity of an escrow agent in any real estate

any funds held in escrow in compliance with Sections
1340.12 unless there has been compliance with Section
1340.13.
   Funds shall be disbursed only upon written authorization from the Fire
Chief. The Fire Chief or his or her designee may authorize the release of funds
as payment in full to a contractor as each violation of this Chapter is
corrected if the amount due does not exceed the written estimates obtained
pursuant to Section
1340.12. In the event the amount due exceeds the contractor's original written
estimates, the Fire Chief or his or her designee may only authorize the release
of funds to the contractor if the Fire Chief or his or her designee makes a

(Ord. 30-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1340.15 DEMOLITION ESCROW.
   The Owner of a commercial or industrial building on Vacant Property which is
slated to be demolished pursuant to the Vacant Property Plan shall place in
escrow with St. Bernard a deposit of twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00)
for a building under 5,000 square feet in size, or seventy five thousand
dollars ($75,000.00) for a building 5,000 square feet or more, unless a fire
escrow is being administered by the Village of St. Bernard's Fire Division, in
which case the Owner shall comply with all requirements and orders of that
Division. If the amount to be placed in escrow under this section cannot be
paid in full, St. Benard shall place a lien on the property for the amount
specified. St. Bernard shall use escrowed funds to complete the plans submitted
by the Owner in the event the Owner does not comply with the Vacant Property
Plan. Escrowed funds may, by prior arrangement, be withdrawn during
construction as follows: twenty percent (20%) upon commencement of work; twenty
percent (20%) upon completion of half of all work; and the remaining sixty
percent (60%) upon completion of all work, including debris disposal, backfill
and seeding. Unused escrow funds will be released upon completion of the work
or transfer of ownership, provided that all fees have been paid in full. New
owners must sign the Vacant Property Plan and accept responsibility in writing
for completing the demolition.
(Ord. 30-2024. Passed 12-19-24.)
1340.16 EFFECTING COMPLIANCE.
   In the event the Owner, Authorized Agent or Person in Control fails to
comply with a Notice of Violation issued in accordance with Section
1340.11, within the period of time stipulated therein, the Fire Chief shall
give notice to the Building Official or their designee that the Vacant Property
is open and unsecure. The Building Official may proceed with any requirements
of Section
1340.10 to secure the property. If St. Bernard completes such abatement work,
upon completion of the work, the department performing the work shall determine
all costs associated therewith, including registration fees, with costs of
labor charged at a rate of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) per hour;
provided, however, there shall be a minimum fee of not less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00). In the event St. Bernard is required to employ outside
services for the abatement work, the fee shall be the actual costs of the
contract plus fifteen percent (15%) for administrative costs incurred by St.
Benard.
   The total abatement costs, inclusive of the registration fee, shall be
forwarded by the Fire Chief to the St. Bernard Auditor, who shall certify the
costs, together with the parcel number or another proper description of the
lands on which the abatement activities occurred, the date the costs were
incurred for each abatement activity and the name of the Owner of record at the
time the costs were incurred to the County Auditor who shall place the costs as
a charge upon the tax list and duplicate. The costs are a lien upon the Vacant
Property from and after the date the costs were incurred. The costs shall be
collected as other taxes and returned to St. Bernard.

full force and effect, and the provisions of this Chapter are hereby declared
to be severable.
   (b)   This Chapter shall not affect violations of any other ordinance, code,
or regulation existing prior to the effective date hereof, and any such
violation shall be governed and shall continue to be punishable to the full
extent of the law under the provisions of the ordinances, codes, or regulations
in effect at the time the violation was committed.

one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
continues. In the event a fine(s) is assessed, the Owner, Authorized Agent, or
Person in Control also remain liable for any amounts owed to the Village, or
repairs or demolition ordered to be undertaken.
   (b)   The application of the penalty provided in subsection A herein shall
not preclude St. Bernard from enforcing its rights to remove, repair and/or
remedy the prohibited conditions, or enforce any other rights it may have, or
seek any other remedies it may be entitled to, in law or in equity. (Ord. 30-

distance and the most favorable driveway grade.
   (b)   Driveways, including the radii (but not including right turn lanes,
passing lanes and tapers), shall be located entirely within the permit
applicant’s right-of-way frontage. This right-of- way frontage is determined by
projecting the property lines perpendicular to the centerline of the road.
Extension of curb and radii on adjacent right-of-way frontage shall be
permitted only upon written agreement from the adjacent property owner and/or
when the Building and Planning Department has determined that such extension is
necessary.
   (c)   If the driveway is to be located adjacent to an intersection, the
point of curvature of the driveway radius shall be at least 77 feet from the
centerline of the intersecting road and at least 17 feet from the future
proposed right-of-way line, whichever distance is greater. The driveway radius
shall not encroach on an intersection radius unless such encroachment is
physically unavoidable.

1355.02 CLEAR VISION AREAS, BUFFER AREAS AND SIGHT DISTANCE.
   (a)   Adjacent to driveways, a buffer area between the right-of-way line and
the pavement edge shall be used, as determined by the Building and Planning
Department, to provide a permanent physical barrier between moving traffic and
private property and unobstructed visions on either side of the driveway. This
buffer area may consist of a lawn area, a low shrub area, a ditch or equivalent
method and may require the removal of trees, brush, earthen embankments and
other obstructions. Where encroachment of parked vehicles may take place, the
Building and Planning Department may require this buffer area to be established
by curb or equivalent method.
   (b)   Sight Distance.
      (1)   Sight distance for residential drives shall be measured 10 feet
from the edge of the traveled portion on gravel roads or 10 feet from the edge
of pavement on paved roads in accordance with the following table:
      (2)   The Building and Planning Department recommends and may require
that the driveway be located in a location that provides sight distance in
excess of the minimums provided herein.
      (3)   Applications for driveways, which do not provide minimum adequate
sight distance, may be denied.

   The design features described herein and the tables with their appropriate
illustration of various driveway features as shown in Tables 1 through 5 shall
be used by the applicant in dimensioning proposed driveways or driveway systems
on plans accompanying driveway permit applications. These standard dimensions
will be used unless conditions require a deviation and the applicant can show
cause for deviation. The Building and Planning Department reserves the right to
determine whether this deviation shall be granted and may specify particular
dimensions in order that particular driveway system will accommodate the
vehicles normally expected without creating undue congestion or hazard on the
road. The letters in parentheses accompanying the following design feature

(or edges of the gravel surface, if applicable) measured at the point where the
edges of the driveway become parallel (point b in the sketches). If the right-
of-way line is so close to the pavement that point b falls on the applicant’s
property, then the width of the driveway at the right-of-way line shall be
based on the projected Driveway Width.
   (c)   "Entering Radius" (C), the radius of the driveway edge curve on the
right side of a vehicle entering the applicant’s property.
   (d)   "Exiting Radius" (D), the radius of the driveway edge curve on the
right side of a vehicle exiting the applicant’s property.

1355.06 SURFACING AND CURBING.
   (a)   Residential driveways should be paved between the edge of pavement and
the existing sidewalk. If there is no existing sidewalk, the surfacing should
extend at least 10 feet from the edge of pavement. On residential driveways,
curb cuts and/or curb returns shall be constructed based on the current Board
standards for curb and gutter.
   (b)   The surface of paved:
      (1)   Residential drives may be paved with 6-inch concrete on compacted
sand or 3-inch bituminous asphalt over 6 inch aggregate. The Building and
Planning Department may request a special pavement design under special
conditions including but not limited to poor soil, industrial or heavy truck
use, all weather route, etc.
   (c)   The surface of all additional lanes and accompanying tapers shall be
the same material as the pavement of the road unless the Building and Planning
Department allows the use of an alternate equivalent pavement. Where the
existing road surface is asphalt, tapers, right turn lanes and passing lanes
shall be 9 inches deep strength asphalt on suitable, well-drained subsoil.
Where the existing road surface is concrete, tapers and additional lanes shall
be 9 inches un- reinforced concrete with anchor bolts to the existing concrete
at 40 inches on center. The Building and Planning Department may request a
special pavement design under special conditions including but not limited to
poor soil, industrial or heavy truck use, all weather route, etc.
   (d)   Curbing shall either be the same detail as the existing curb or shall
conform to the current TITLE 8 standards for curb and gutter, at the discretion
of the Building and Planning Department.
      (1)   In areas with existing paved shoulders, the paved shoulder shall be
removed and replaced with specified pavement. The 3 foot paved shoulder shall
then be constructed next to the new widening (to the same specification as
described in Section
1355.05).
      (2)   The curb height shall be constant if there is no existing or
proposed sidewalk.
      (3)   Where a driveway grade meets the grade of an existing sidewalk, the
curb shall be lowered to provide a sidewalk curb opening.
      (4)   All walks and curbs shall conform with the requirements of MCL
125.1361 and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which requires
appropriate curb cuts to walks for handicapped access.
         (Ord. 59-2007. Passed 1-3-08.)
1355.07 DRAINAGE AND PROFILE.
   (a)   The driveway shall be constructed so that the drainage of the road is
not adversely affected by the driveway. The drainage and the stability of the
road sub grade shall not be altered by driveway construction or roadside
development.
   (b)   Drainage from adjacent private property in excess assumed agricultural
run-off should not be discharged directly into the road drainage system.
Drainage from areas, which did not previously contribute to the road drainage
system, will not be accepted unless specifically authorized by the Building and
Planning Department.
   (c)   All culvert pipes used shall be of a size adequate to carry the
anticipated flow of the ditch based on a "ten year storm" event. The culvert
shall be no smaller than the size determined by the Building and Planning
Department nor shall it be less than 12 inches inside diameter. All culverts,
catch basins, drainage channels and other drainage structures required within
the road right-of-way shall be manufactured or constructed and installed in
accordance with the current Ohio Department of Transportation Standard
Specifications for Construction. The minimum length of the culvert may be
determined as the sum of the width of the driveway plus the adjacent fore slope
and back slope; maximum slope of 1 on 2. The use of headwalls on culvert ends
will not be permitted. The use of sloped and sections are encouraged.
   (d)   The driveway profile shall be determined using the following criteria:
      (1)   If the road is uncurbed, the grade of the driveway between the road
edge of pavement and the edge of the shoulder shall conform to the slope of the
shoulder.
      (2)   The grade of driveways connecting to curbed road may be the grade
required meeting the sidewalk elevation if the sidewalk is 10 feet or less from
the road edge of pavement. The grade cannot exceed the maximums given in Rule
3.7 4 (c). If the driveway grade does exceed the allowable grade, the sidewalk
shall be adjusted.
      (3)   For uncurbed roads, if the sidewalk is more than 10 feet from the
edge of pavement or if there is no sidewalk at a point 25 feet from the edge of
pavement:
         A.   At a point 25 feet from the edge of pavement the grade of
Residential and Utility Structure driveways and Field Entrances shall be within
2.5 feet of the edge of pavement grade. (10% maximum)
      (4)   Vertical curves (150 foot minimum) shall be provided at all changes
of grade of four percent or more.
      (5)   If the sidewalk elevation must be adjusted to meet the driveway,
the slope shall not exceed 3/8 inch per foot.
         A.   The enclosure of existing ditches beyond the end of normal
culvert length is not allowed unless specifically approved by the Building and
Planning Department.
