   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT    THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER;
AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Newton Falls, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF NEWTON FALLS, STATE OF OHIO, HEREBY ORDAINS:
SECTION I: That the ordinances of the City of Newton Falls, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Newton Falls, Ohio, 1994.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the City Clerk, attached to this Ordinance as a part hereof,
and filed with the permanent records of the City of Newton Falls, Ohio.
SECTION II: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance
except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to September 1, 1994.
SECTION III: That all legislation enacted subsequent to September 1, 1994,
which amended, replaced or otherwise affected a material provision of those
ordinances existing prior to September 1, 1994 shall be deemed to amend,
replace or affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified
Ordinances as reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as
otherwise indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
SECTION IV: That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the City, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
City, so as to facilitate administration and daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.
SECTION V: This Ordinance shall take effect upon passage.
PASSED IN COUNCIL THIS  7  DAY OF November, 1994.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

distribution need not be published in a newspaper, either before or after final

it has been passed on the first reading shall, however, be made available to
public inspection in the office of the City Clerk and in lieu of publication of

effect upon passage. Such emergency ordinance shall set forth and define the
specific facts designating the emergency. Such emergency ordinance shall
require no public hearing and both the first and second reading may be passed
at the same meeting. Such emergency ordinance shall be published as other
ordinances after final passage. No ordinance granting a franchise or fixing a
rate to be charged by a public utility shall be passed as an emergency measure.
   It is not sufficient for the passage of an ordinance as an emergency measure
to merely state the ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, health, welfare, or safety, without providing additional
rationale for passing the ordinance on an emergency basis. In the absence of
such additional justifying language, electors shall have the right to exercise
any referendum rights available with respect to the ordinance. If the emergency
ordinance does not receive an affirmative vote of at least four-fifths of the
members elected to Council on its first reading, the ordinance shall be deemed
to have failed to pass at that meeting and shall require two additional
readings and a public hearing before passage as required by

publication, and shall take effect immediately upon their adoption.

elected to Council. Matters that may be adopted by Council by motion shall
require the affirmative vote of a majority of those members present at the
meeting at the time the vote is taken. The Mayor is only permitted to vote on
matters before Council in the event of a tie. The Mayor shall not be counted in
calculating the number of members elected to Council for voting purposes unless
he actually casts a vote in the event of a tie. For voting purposes, Council
shall never be considered more than a five person Council. If one or more
Council offices are vacant, the number of persons serving on Council at the
time the vote is taken shall be considered the number of those members elected

   b.    Abstentions. Councilmembers shall, after providing an explanation
therefor, abstain from voting on matters before Council when they have a
conflict of interest with respect to the matter being considered. If a
Councilmember abstains from voting due to a conflict of interest, the
abstaining member shall be treated as if they were not present for the vote for
the purpose of determining the number of votes needed to pass an ordinance,
resolution, or motion. With the exception of abstaining from a vote to approve
minutes for a meeting at which a Councilmember was not present or in the event
of a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety, Councilmembers shall

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

133.01 BID PROCEDURE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.
   (a)   The City Manager shall seek bids either as an aggregate bid from a
prime contractor or separate bids from individual contractors for any City
project for the erection of repair, alterations, or rebuilding of a public
building, institution, bridge, culvert or improvement.
   (b)   The City Manager shall review the bid process with each City
Department or engineer to determine what is the best bid process for each
project.
   (c)   Upon determining the best process for bidding for a particular
project, the City Manager shall notify the department advertising for bids how
the project should be bid. However, if the project has already been submitted
for bid the City Manager shall review that project to determine if the bidding
procedure used was in the best interest of the City before awarding the final
bid.
(Ord. 2006-11. Passed 3-20-06.)
133.02 VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDER FEE.
   (a)   Subject to Ohio R.C. 1332.32 taking effect, in accordance with the
requirements of said Ohio R.C. 1332.32, all video service providers providing
video service in the City pursuant to a video service authorization obtained
from the Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce shall pay Video Service
Provider Fees (“VSP Fees”) in the amount of five percent (5%) of gross revenues
received from providing video service in the City, which gross revenue base
shall include advertising revenues as permitted and defined by Ohio R.C.
1332.32(B)(2)(g). The VSP Fee shall be paid quarterly, not sooner than forty-
five days nor later than sixty days after the end of each calender quarter.
   (b)   The City Manager is hereby authorized and directed, upon receipt of
notice from a video service provider that it will begin providing video service
in the City pursuant to a state- issued video service authorization, to provide
such video service provider with notice of the VSP fee as determined by this
Council above, which notice shall be delivered in a manner that provides for
proof of timely delivery. (Ord. 2007-13. Passed 9-17-07.)
133.03  CONTRACT AUTHORITY.
   The City Manager may enter into a contract to purchase goods or services
without the necessity of public bids, on behalf of the City, if the amount of
the contract is less than that prescribed in Ohio R.C. 731.14, and as it is
amended from time to time, provided that prior approval of Council is obtained
for expenditures in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). No one project
can be paid or contracted for in such manner that a bid is divided so as to
avoid the ten thousand dollar ($10,000) limit. In the event of an emergency in
the City’s utility departments, (i.e., Electric, Water Distribution, Water
Treatment, and Wastewater Departments) the ten thousand dollar ($10,000)
spending threshold can be waived up to a maximum of thirty-five thousand
dollars ($35,000) for the purchase of equipment and other expenses related to
only the emergency repairs if both the affected utility department
superintendent and the City Manager authorize the purchase. In any instance
where the ten thousand dollar ($10,000) spending threshold is exceeded, the
City Manager shall, within twelve (12) hours of the purchase, provide all
members of Council with the details of the emergency, including what was
purchased and the amount spent, and the City Manager shall direct the Clerk to
add the issue to the next regular meeting agenda for discussion.

ordinance has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
ordinance that is not otherwise defined in this ordinance is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the
use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other

         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of

income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

amount carried forward.

shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts

5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Newton Falls shall be considered as having a taxable situs in

as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Newton Falls to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Newton
Falls to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Newton Falls, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of

            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
191.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
191.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Newton Falls and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within Newton Falls
to purchasers outside Newton Falls, provided that the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Newton Falls to the extent that such services are performed in Newton Falls.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Newton Falls shall be sitused to Newton Falls.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Newton Falls shall be sitused to Newton

         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Newton Falls based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Newton Falls.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Newton Falls' tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Newton Falls or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Newton Falls.

the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

Falls to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of Newton Falls shall report
the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Newton Falls. The individual may claim a credit for taxes

extent that such a credit is allowed under Newton Falls' income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Left intentionally blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee or a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner who chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. " Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of
an employee owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
             (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as
an office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that
is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
191.04 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the appointment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return, or if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work locati on is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business op erations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
191.04 of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 2023-50. Passed 12-19-23.)

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Newton Falls shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Newton Falls. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
191.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
191.03 of this ordinance, of one percent (1.0%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Newton Falls the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Newton Falls in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Newton Falls in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment and subsequent payments, based on the Tax Administrator's
determination, may be required to be made by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Newton Falls.
The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not
affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return
as required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Newton Falls as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Newton Falls income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Newton Falls the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Newton Falls income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Newton Falls until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Newton Falls during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Newton Falls
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

section, an employer is not required to withhold Newton Falls income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Newton Falls if the employee performed such services in Newton Falls on 20
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in Newton
Falls.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Newton Falls. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Newton Falls at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last

employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Newton
Falls only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in Newton Falls than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:

perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Newton Falls exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Newton Falls for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Newton Falls.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for Newton Falls
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for Newton
Falls for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in Newton Falls.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is Newton Falls and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
191.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Newton Falls, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Newton Falls.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
191.04.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
      (A)    An annual Newton Falls income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject
to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
191.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due Newton Falls.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Newton Falls
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to Newton Falls, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Newton Falls, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

   (E)    Newton Falls shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Newton Falls to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to Newton Falls. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Newton Falls. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Newton Falls' income tax
return. The extended due date of Newton Falls' income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For the tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of Newton Falls’ income tax return for a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Newton Falls' income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Newton Falls income tax return.
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
Newton Falls income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
Newton Falls' income tax return. The extended due date of Newton Falls' income
tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Newton Falls, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
tax return under division(G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first. If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00). Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, Newton Falls shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Newton Falls for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Newton
Falls an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
191.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for Newton Falls by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Newton Falls, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Newton Falls and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by Newton Falls to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Newton Falls, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Newton
Falls or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
ordinance and of Newton Falls' ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Newton
Falls' income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension
for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown
to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Newton Falls
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Newton Falls during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to Newton Falls before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Newton Falls in accordance with
this ordinance. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Newton Falls'
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Newton Falls income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Newton Falls. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated Newton Falls income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Newton Falls income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Newton Falls income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
       (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Newton Falls income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Newton Falls. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

Section
191.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Newton Falls. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Newton Falls;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Newton Falls income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Newton Falls income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
191.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Newton Falls income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Newton Falls in accordance with this
ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Newton Falls before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Newton Falls may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

191.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Newton Falls who is required
to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance, may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due Newton Falls under this ordinance, or the tax due the other
municipality, whichever is less.
   (B)    Newton Falls shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Newton Falls who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    No credit shall be allowed for school district income tax.

amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

with the return in accordance with Section
191.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Newton Falls under Section
191.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Newton Falls but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS. 
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
191.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Newton Falls:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with Newton Falls, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Newton Falls as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Newton Falls is subject to recovery by Newton Falls.
If Newton Falls' tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed
for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Newton
Falls shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Newton
Falls claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If Newton Falls' tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Newton
Falls' tax rate. However, if Newton Falls' tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Newton Falls, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for Newton Falls changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Newton Falls. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
191.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
       (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Newton Falls. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
191.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Newton Falls' tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Newton Falls return showing income
subject to Newton Falls income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Newton
Falls income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Review the request described in Section
191.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the sixtieth day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
191.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Newton Falls does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio board of
tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
191.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
191.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Newton Falls income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Newton Falls official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local Board of Review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Newton Falls
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Newton Falls that arises pursuant to Newton Falls' income tax imposed in
accordance with this ordinance.
(B) Nothing in this ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing either
of the following if such action is in the best interests of Newton Falls:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. 
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Newton Falls as
authorized by this ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this ordinance and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Newton Falls from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-14. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Newton Falls ordinance or state
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Newton Falls or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Newton Falls to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor

   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
transaction. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the
private property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,

for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise

section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4503.231.
      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the

The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving
privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the

alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.

any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

   (a)   The City of Newton Falls Parking Violations Bureau is hereby
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.04. The Parking Violations Bureau shall
be within the office of the Clerk of the Newton Falls Municipal Court. The
Parking Violations Bureau has jurisdiction over each parking infraction that

(Ord. 2017-27. Passed 1-22-18.)
352.04  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE, AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   The parking ticket adopted in Section
 352.10 hereof shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which
a person is charged with committing a parking infraction within the City of
Newton Falls. The parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for
purposes of this chapter.
   (b)   A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction
charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator
in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
      Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by
affixation as provided in this Division, or by the procedure described in
subsection (d) hereof, has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects
both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted
in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and
costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as
if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of
the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   
   (c)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this Section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City of Newton Falls and of the law enforcement agency whose
officer issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this Section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this Section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement and
if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
352.09 hereof.
   
   (e)   Except as provided in Section
352.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is
served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and
the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to

352.05 ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
      (a)    A person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction may answer the charge by
appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail. An answer
shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of the infraction and shall be
in one of the following forms:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)   A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
If the Judge determines that the explanation mitigates the fact that the person
committed the parking infraction, the Judge shall eliminate or reduce the
amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction. If the fine is
eliminated or reduced and the person has previously paid the fine, the amount
paid in excess of the revised fine shall be returned to the person; if the fine
is eliminated or reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine, the
person shall pay only the amount of the revised fine. If the Judge determines
that the explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the
parking infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine arising out
of the parking infraction, and if the person has not previously paid the fine,
the person shall pay the entire amount of the fine. If a person admits that he
committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person fails to pay the
amount of the fine due within ten days after receiving notice of the Judge's
determination, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the Judge's
determination and the amount of the fine due shall be considered a judgment and
shall be treated as if it were a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held
pursuant to Division (b) of Section
352.07 hereof.
      (3)   A person who denies that he committed a parking infraction shall be
granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
352.07 hereof.
   (c)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, the Parking Violations Bureau
shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant to Section
352.06 hereof, and proceed according to that Section. Failure to answer the
charge within the ten (10) day period provided by subsection (a) hereof shall
result in the imposition of an additional penalty of ten dollars ($10.00).
   (d)   The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

subsection (b) of Section
352.05 hereof for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a parking
ticket, except that any determination of the amount to be paid under an answer

(Ord. 2017-27. Passed 1-22-18.)
352.07  HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   (1)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives
a notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each
hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner considers
appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
      (2)   At the hearing, the City of Newton Falls has the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is
being conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in his answer,
denied that he committed the parking infraction and requested the presence at
the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the
officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the
hearing examiner determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the
officer's presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable
to attend the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing
examiner may grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is
being conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing.
The person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary
evidence to the hearing examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
      (3)   The City of Newton Falls shall submit the original parking ticket
that was personally or constructively served on the person or a true copy of
that ticket, and information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies
the owner of the vehicle. The ticket and the information in proper form is
prima-facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person
who committed the parking infraction. The City of Newton Falls may present
additional evidence and testimony at the hearing. The City of Newton Falls does
not have to be represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   (1)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) of this section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits
evidence in accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall
consider all evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the
City of Newton Falls has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the
person committed the parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines
that the person committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination
as a judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered
in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) of this section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that division, the hearing examiner shall,
if he determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A default
judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)   If a person who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
 352.06 hereof does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of that
section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
       (4)   If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsections (b)
(1), (2), or (3) of this section committed the parking infraction, the hearing
examiner shall enter judgment against the City of Newton Falls, shall dismiss
the charge of the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)   A default judgment entered under this section may be vacated by the
hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one year of the date of entry
of the judgment;
         B.   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the Judgment arose;
         C.   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten (10) days of the
date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default judgment
shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the City of Newton Falls and the
Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its
disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed
with the office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so filed, shall
have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered
in the Court.
      As required by division (C) of Ohio R.C. 4521.08, judgments and default
judgments filed with the Newton Falls Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of
Court, Civil Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment
roll from other judgments rendered in that Court. Computer printouts,
microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or other similar data recording techniques may
be utilized to record such judgments. When a judgment or default judgment is
filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be
taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid
money judgment in a civil action rendered in that Court. The Municipal Court
may assess additional costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not
exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid upon
satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is entered
pursuant to this section and the City of Newton Falls if judgment is entered
against the City pursuant to this section may appeal the judgment or default
judgment to the Newton Falls Municipal Court by filing notices of appeal with
the Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within fifteen (15) days
of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable
costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Court shall
schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with the
rules of the Court. Service of a notice of appeal under this division by a
person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default
judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files
the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the
judgment, plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of
the Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the
Parking Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Municipal Court
may be taken.
   (e)   A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this section may be
filed with the Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division,
under subsection (c) of this Section at any time within three (3) years after
the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking infraction out
of which the judgment arose. This subsection applies to any ticket issued for
an offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective date of
this Section, if the ticket was issued within three (3) years prior to the
effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued and served on
the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by

of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify the
matter to the Law Director for enforcement.

in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
 545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

or merchandise prize awarded for winning the game, can be controlled by a
source other than any player playing the game.
         D.   The success of any player is or may be determined by a chance
event that cannot be altered by player actions.
         E.   The ability of any player to succeed at the game is determined by
game features not visible or known to the player.
         F.   The ability of the player to succeed at the game is impacted by
the exercise of a skill that no reasonable player could exercise.
      (3)   All of the following apply to any machine that is operated as
described in subsection (a)(1) hereof.
         A.   As used in this section, “game” and “play” mean one event from
the initial activation of the machine until the results of play are determined
without payment of additional consideration. An individual utilizing a machine
that involves a single game, play, contest, competition or tournament may be
awarded redeemable vouchers or merchandise prizes based on the results of play.
         B.   Advance play for a single game, play, contest, competition, or
tournament participation may be purchased. The cost of the contest, competition
or tournament participation may be greater than a single noncontest,
competition or tournament play.
         C.   To the extent that the machine is used in a contest, competition
or tournament, that contest, competition or tournament has a defined starting
and ending date and is open to participants in competition for scoring and
ranking results toward the awarding of redeemable vouchers or merchandise
prizes that are stated prior to the start of the contest, competition or
tournament.
      (4)   For purposes of division (a)(1) of this section, the mere presence
of a device, such as a pin-setting, ball-releasing or scoring mechanism, that
does not contribute to or affect the outcome of the play of the game does not
make the device a skill-based amusement machine.
   (b)   (1)   “Slot machine” means either of the following:
         A.   Any mechanical, electronic, video or digital device that is
capable of accepting anything of value, directly or indirectly, from or on
behalf of a player who gives the thing of value in the hope of gain;
         B.   Any mechanical, electronic, video, or digital device that is
capable of accepting anything of value, directly or indirectly, from or on
behalf of a player to conduct or dispense bingo or a scheme or game of chance.
      (2)   “Slot machine” does not include a skill-based amusement machine.

(Ord. 2008-01. Passed 2-11-08.)

   A separate license shall be required for each and every mechanical amusement
device which is displayed by any person at any one time, but any licensee may
change from the display of one approved mechanical amusement device to the
display of another approved mechanical amusement device at any time. A license
issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not be transferred from one
person to another person, but such license may be transferred by the licensee
therein named from the place specified in such license to another place owned
by such licensee, should the licensee move his business from the address
specified in the license to another location. No license shall be issued for

the licensee to conspicuously display the license issued hereunder.
735.06 INSPECTION AND SEALING OF MECHANICAL AMUSEMENT DEVICES.

cause for the revocation of such license or licenses held by such violator,

directly from the surveyor.
   (h)   Charges for Disconnection or Downgrading of Service.
      (1)   Provider may impose a charge reasonably related to the Provider’s
actual cost incurred for a downgrade of service, except that no such charges
may be imposed when:
         A.   A Subscriber requests total disconnection from the System; or
         B.   A Subscriber requests the downgrade within a thirty (30) day
period following any rate increase or substantial change in programming
relative to the service in question.

for each day that the Provider fails to comply with the order. An order of the
Commission shall be final only after a hearing and referral to Council as set
forth hereinafter.
      (Ord. 95-05. Passed 2-20-95.)
739.02 CABLE TELEVISION COMMISSION.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Cable Television Commission of the City
which shall consist of three members; two members shall be members of the

Council shall appoint the two Council members to the Commission at the same
time they designate other committee appointments in January of each year. The

(Ord. 2002-43. Passed 1-6-03.)
   (b)   The Commission shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
      (1)   The hearing of complaints of subscribers made in writing to the
Commission regarding alleged violation of the customer service standards set
forth in this chapter. The Commission shall endeavor to informally resolve all

resolved, a hearing shall be held by the Commission on the complaint with at
least ten days’ written notice to the provider and the complainant. After
hearing, the Commission shall make findings and conclusions and issue an order
and/or assess a penalty, if appropriate. All normal decisions of the Commission
regarding customer service shall be subject to review by Council which may act
to affirm, overrule or modify the decision of the Commission or any aspect of
the decision within thirty days of announcement of the decision. In the event
Council takes no action within such thirty day period, the decision of the
Commission shall be deemed final.
      (2)   The Commission shall have responsibility for reviewing requests for
the establishment of all cable rates and rate changes and making
recommendations for approval or disapproval to Council. In reviewing requests
by a provider for initial rates or for rate changes, the Commission may utilize
City staff and/or outside professional assistance at the direction of the City
Manger. The provider shall reimburse the City for the cost of any outside
professional assistance in reviewing rate changes to the extent permitted by
law. After review of a rate request, the Commission shall make a recommendation
to Council for approval or disapproval. No cable television rate shall be
deemed approved or disapproved until approved or disapproved by Council. The
Commission shall hold a public hearing on all requests for rate changes.
   (c)   The Commission shall establish a schedule of regular meetings and
shall meet at such regularly scheduled meetings at least four times per year.
The Commission may hold special meetings to review particular complaints or
rate change requests or other matters. Notice of special meetings shall comply
with the City’s general notice requirements for special meetings of its boards
and commissions and shall include written notice to all providers. The
Commission, with the assistance of the Law Department, may establish its own
rules to govern the conduct of its meetings. (Ord. 95-05. Passed 2-20-95.)

in any franchise agreements for the provision of cable television service.

and Section 632 (47 U.S.C. S 552) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 and Federal Communications Commission regulations
adopted thereunder.

City harmless from any and all damages to persons and property resulting from
such excavation or opening or from want of reasonable diligence and care. The

Manager or a necessary function of a City contract, the permit holder or

permit or may elect to restore and replace any street, avenue, drive, alley,
lawn, sidewalk, sewer, public ground or improvement and charge the cost and
expense thereof to the person obtaining such permit.

for water service at the Utility Office.
   (b)   All applications involving an original or new service line
installation shall be made by and only in the name of the property owner. By

(Ord. 90-2. Passed 2-5-90.)
953.02 DEPOSIT WITH APPLICATION.
   (a)   A deposit will be required of each person, tenant or property owner,
signing for water service. This may be increased to an amount comparable to the
anticipated water charge for one billing period or to a larger amount if the
signee has had a record of delinquent payment. This deposit is guarantee of
payment of the final bill, and remains in the deposit account until the final
bill is computed. The remainder, after deduction of the final bill, is returned
to the water service signee upon his request, or to his authorized agent after
proper identification. A deposit may be transferred to another account after
the final bill has been paid. Interest will not be paid on deposits.
   (b)   If an unpaid balance remains after application of the deposit, no

until the Water Department serviceman is able to shut off service to the
property. At termination of service, the meter will be read and a final billing
made.
(Ord. 90-2. Passed 2-5-90.)
953.05 METERING.
   (a)   Source of Billing.
      (1)   The consumption of water in gallons, as recorded by the water
meter, will be used to bill the consumer for water service. All water
consumption registered on the water meter shall be charged and billed,
regardless of whether the water was used or lost through accidental means.
      (2)   If a meter stops or fails to register properly while in use, the
water consumption will be estimated from the record of water consumption during
a past period when conditions were similar and meter registration was correct.
   (b)   Testing.
      (1)   In the case of a question arising as to the accuracy of the meter
the consumer shall request the Utility to test the meter. If the meter is found
to be correct within three percent (3%), the Utility reserves the right to
charge the consumer fifteen dollars ($15.00) for making such a test, otherwise
the expenses of the test shall be borne by the Utility Office.
      (2)   Any adjustment to be made where a meter inaccuracy in excess of
three percent (3%) is found, shall not cover a period of water usage in excess
of six months.
   (c)   Location.
      (1)   The water meters will be furnished by the Water Department and will
be set, removed, or adjusted by employees of this Department only. The location
of the meter, and plans for the arrangement of a meter pit must be satisfactory
to the Water Department and the plumbing must be so arranged that a meter can
be set in place without disturbing any of the building water pipes. Meters will
not be permitted in unaccessible places. All installations will have remote
readout meters.
      (2)   On property where there is no basement, the meter may be mounted in
the kitchen, utility room or other protected area. The installations of meters,
larger than two inches, must be equipped with a back flow prevention device
approved by the City of Newton Falls Water Distribution Department.
   (d)   Position and Care. Meters must be placed and maintained so as to be
accessible for reading and service. Passage ways must be opened at all times.
If access to a meter is difficult or denied for any reason, water service to
the property may be suspended.
   (e)   Stolen or Damaged. If a meter installed on the premises is stolen,
damaged by freezing, fire, or hot water, or is damaged in any way through
neglect, the cost of repairs or replacement shall be paid by the property
owner. Payment must be made in full before another meter is re-set.
   (f)   Tampering. Evidence of tampering with the meter in any manner, is
sufficient cause to deny water service to the property. In any case where the
meter seal or dial glass is broken or where the meter has been disassembled in
whole or part, the meter will be replaced and the consumer will be billed for
the cost of repair and replacement service.
(Ord. 90-2. Passed 2-5-90.)
953.06 BILLING.
   Bills for water service unpaid thirty days after the billing date will be
considered delinquent and may be turned off until paid in full. A service
charge must be paid along with the unpaid balance before a turn on will be
made. If this turn on is requested after normal working hours, the service
charge will equal three hours pay, at the overtime rate.
(Ord. 90-2. Passed 2-5-90.)
953.065  CHARGES A LIEN.
   Each water charge billed pursuant to this chapter on an account in the name
of the property owner is hereby made a lien upon the premises charged
therewith, and if the same is not paid prior to thirty-one (31) days after the
date upon which it is due and payable, it may be certified by the Finance
Director to the County Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate,
with interest and penalties allowed by law, to be collected as other Municipal
taxes are collected. An administrative fee of one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) shall be added and assessed for all delinquent water charges that are
certified to the County Auditor for placement on the next tax duplicate for
collection. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the application
of this chapter for the purposes of liens previously certified to the County
Auditor, and failure of any owner to learn that he purchased property against
which a lien for water charges exists shall in no way affect his responsibility
for such payment.

service line must be connected to the City's water main line. The service line
shall not cross one property to serve another property, by any means. Where
more than one dwelling exists on a lot, a single service line must be used, but
each branch service must be provided without an outside curb valve. A master
curb valve must be provided for the master service line near the property.
   (h)   Curb Valve. Each service line shall be provided with an approved
outside shut off valve near the street property line as approved and furnished
by the Water Department. This valve shall be controlled by the Water Department
alone, except licensed plumbers may operate this valve when making plumbing
repairs for the property, but for no other purpose.
   (i)   Building Valve. Each service line must be provided with an approved
inside valve located as close as possible to the point where the service line
enters the building. All service lines larger than one inch must be equipped
with this type of valve on each side of the water meter to eliminate back flow
when the meter is removed.
   (j)   Replacement; Addition or Alteration. No addition, replacement,
alteration, or repair shall be made to the service lines without the expressed
permission and inspection of the Water Department.

surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
Storm water management practices that meet the criteria in this regulation, and
additional criteria required by the City of Newton Falls Engineering
Department, Ohio shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in The City of Newton Falls Subdivision Regulations],
shall provide storm water management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section.07 of this regulation, and the
activity is in compliance with Chapter
959 [The City of Newton Falls Erosion and Sediment Control Requirements] and
Trumbull County's Setback requirements, all as determined by The City Engineer.
      (5)   Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the City Engineer.
      (7)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Newton Falls,
Ohio storm water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions
shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership
or, if compensated by the property owners, by the City of Newton Falls. Storm
water management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (8)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
      (9)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated storm water runoff
from BMPs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be preformed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure: The City Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
958.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
959 [The of City of Newton Falls Erosion and Sediment Control Requirements] and
Trumbull County's setback requirements all as determined by the City Engineer.
At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges: Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this in not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the City of Newton Falls.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Newton Falls zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City of Newton
Falls Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 15 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Newton Falls,
Ohio:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 15 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Newton
Falls, Ohio must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material.
First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to
the new floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration
will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to
compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the
contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Newton Falls,
Ohio reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the
legal boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory
storage areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the
disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically
prohibited.
NOTE: Subsection (8) above should be coordinated with the community's riparian
setback ordinance. The requirement for compensatory floodplain storage is only
in effect when the riparian setback does not include the entire 100-year
floodplain, when the community grants a variance that allows filling in the
floodplain due to site constraints, or when the Community Engineer determines
that stream or floodplain restoration is needed to meet the objectives of this
regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control:  
      (1)   Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following storm water management practices. These
practices are listed in Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to
meet the following general performance standards:
         A.   Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm water
runoff; filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water; promote infiltration
and evapotranspiration of storm water; and discharge the controlled runoff to a
water resource.
         B.   Extended detention facilities that detain storm water; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled storm water to a
water resource.
         C.   Infiltration facilities that retain storm water; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
storm water into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering
report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
         D.   For sites less than five (5) acres, but greater than one (1) acre
and not part of a common plan of development, where 5 or more acres are
disturbed, the City of Newton Falls Engineer may approve other BMPs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City of Newton Falls Engineer's satisfaction that
these BMPs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
958.09(c)(6).
         E.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City of Newton Falls Engineer may approve
other BMPs if the applicant demonstrates to the City of Newton Falls Engineer's
satisfaction that these BMPs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated
in Section
958.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         F.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City of Newton Falls Engineer may approve BMPs not included in
Table 2 of this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version
of the Ohio Departments of Transportations "Location and Design Manual, Volume
Two Drainage Design".
   NOTE: In subsection (2) below the size of the water quality volume (WQv)
orifice can be limited to 2.5 inches in extended detention ponds when drainage
areas are too small to allow a practical WQv orifice size.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all storm water management practices.
Practices chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and to
ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed best management practices
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQV = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQV   = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
                  P   = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A   = area draining into the storm water practice, in acres.
         Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume can be
determined using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to
calculate the runoff coefficient, if the applicant can demonstrate that
appropriate controls are in place to limit the proposed impervious area of the
development:
   
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial and Commercial                          0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (4<dwellings/acre)         0.3
Open Space and Recreational Acres                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the storm water practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of storm water practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Storm water quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.

Sand and other Media Filtration                          40 hours
 
* The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no standing
or residual water pool.
** Sized to pass a hydrograph with a volume equal to the WQv, a duration of 2
hours, peak rainfall intensity of 1 inch/hour at a depth of no more than 3
inches and have a minimum hydraulic residence time of 5 minutes. The use of
this criterion is limited to sites where the total area disturbed is 5 acres or
less. Prior approval from the City Engineer, is necessary to use this practice.
For sites greater than five (5) acres or less than five (5) acres but part of a
larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5) or more
acres, prior written approval is required from the Ohio EPA.
*** The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all extended dry
detention basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
+Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv .
^Pocket wetland must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in a
pool and 75% in marshes. The EDV above the permanent pool must be equal to the
WQv.
 
 
NOTE: This table is similar to that found in the Ohio EPA Construction General
Permit. It has been re-ordered to match CRWP's recommended BMP categories and
additional description of the "drain time" for vegetated swales and filter
strips has been added. The "Flow Through Design" BMP is an Ohio EPA alternative
practice and does require additional approvals from the Community Engineer and
Ohio EPA depending the development site size, and can be removed from the table
if necessary.
         D.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility fall within hydrologic soil groups A or B, if the seasonal high water
table is at least three (3) feet below the final grade elevation, and any
underlying bedrock is at least six feet below the final grade elevation.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         C.   Facilities designed according to the flow through design drain
time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where:
               a.   The total area disturbed is 5 acres or less
               b.   The discharge rate from the BMP will have negligible
hydrologic impacts to received waters as described in Section
958.09(c)(6)B.
               c.   Prior written approval is given by the City Engineer; and
               d.   For sites greater than five (5) acres or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, prior written approval has been given by the
Ohio EPA.
            2.   Be designed to slow and filter runoff flowing through the turf
grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than 3 inches.
            3.   Be designed to have a minimum hydraulic residence time of 5
minutes.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or a
diffuse flow using a plunge pool, flow diffuser or level spreader, before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. A valve
shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume for removal of accumulated
sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism,
maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hearty plants comparable to wetland vegetation that
are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
      A fore-bay designed to allow larger sediment particles to settle shall be
placed at basin inlets. The fore-bay and micro-pool volume shall be equal to at
least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
Note: The section below identifies the criteria that are currently be used by
the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices that are not
listed in Table 2.
      (6)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction BMPs:
The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction BMPs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these BMPs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To demonstrate
the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative BMP has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected BMP is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the BMP will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The storm water drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has identified water
quality problems in the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management practices are
designed to meet the following requirements for storm water quantity control
for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
       (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the City
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the development drainage area before and after development. These
calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
            4.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
958.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of
Runoff is:                                The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
-----                     10               1 year
10                        20               2 year

959.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
Area requiring permanent stabilization   Time frame to apply erosion controls

winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Newton Falls, Ohio
Engineer and/or the Trumbull SWCD, is required for any one of the following
conditions, as determined in Table 3 below:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.   10-acres of disturbed drainage.
   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area and have a
minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a drainage area over
5 acres.
   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model.
   When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and
areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length
for each one unit of width (> 2:1 length:width ratio), however a length to
width ration of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment-
settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. This
limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth.
When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public
safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
   Based on site conditions, City of Newton Falls, Ohio Engineer and/or the
Trumbull County SWCD may require additional best management practices to
control off site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
959.09(g) of this regulation.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City of Newton Falls, Ohio Engineer
and/or the Trumbull SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water
trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of
disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Surface Waters of the State protection Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
       (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums stored
on-site shall in a marked storage area. Secondary containment is required for
fuel/liquid storage areas and/or tanks and must have one of the following
regardless of size:
         A.   An earthen dike constructed around the containment area with a
capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all containers in the storage area.
         B.   A self contained structural dike with a minimum capacity equal to
110% of the volume of all containers in the storage area. The plug for these
systems must be kept in the dike tank at all times.
         C.   A properly functional double walled tank for all fuel/liquid
storage containers.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, fire code, spill prevention,
control and countermeasure (SPCC) regulations, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections.  All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the City of Newton Falls Engineer and/or the Trumbull County SWCD and all
of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Newton Falls, Ohio or an
alternate form acceptable to the City of Newton Falls Engineer. The inspection
form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the City of Newton Falls Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City of Newton Falls Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site. (Ord. 2013-06.

Determination of Billing Capacity
The monthly billing capacity (kW) shall be the maximum demand established by
the Consumer using the highest fifteen-minute integrated demand during the
month for which the bill is rendered, as indicated or recorded by a demand
meter.
Where demand metering equipment is installed and the power factor at the time
of maximum measured demand is less than eighty-five percent (85%), Utility
reserves the right to determine the billing capacity based on the measured kVA
demand instead of kW demand. Where highly fluctuating or intermittent loads,
welding machines, electric furnaces, hoists, elevators, X-rays, and the like
are operated by the Consumer, Utility reserves the right to determine the
billing demand by averaging the Consumer’s total load over a two-minute period
or by increasing the 15-minute measured maximum demand by fifty percent (50%)
of the kVA nameplate rating of the fluctuating load equipment that is in
operation. Where such fluctuating loads require additional or separate
transformers or additional system capacity, the measured billing capacity as
determined above shall be increased by seventy percent (70%) of the nameplate
rated kVA capacity of the additional transformers, or kVA of system capacity
required to adequately service such fluctuating loads.
Riders
Consumers under this schedule shall be subject to the applicable Power Cost
Adjustment Rider and Ohio Excise Tax Rider.
Minimum Charge
The monthly Minimum Charge under this Schedule shall be not less than the
Service Charge and applicable capacity rate per kW of monthly Billing Capacity
as hereinafter determined, nor less than the Minimum Charge specified in the
Consumer’s Service Contract with Utility.
The Minimum Charge is applicable on a 12-month year-round basis and seasonal
disconnects will not avoid the applicable Billing Capacity and resultant
Minimum Charge.
Other Terms and Conditions
   (1)   Application For Service and Responsibility for Payment of Bills: Shall
be in accordance with Utility’s Service Policy.
   (2)   Application for Temporary Service: For temporary service, Utility’s
Service Policy shall apply. Utility reserves the right to require that
Applications for Temporary Service be in the name of the property owner, who
shall be subject to the Utility’s applicable charges for such temporary
service.
   (3)   Character of Service: For new installations, service will normally be
supplied through a single set of service wires with all service delivered to a
single meter location. Under such conditions, a single bill will be rendered
for service.
      Three-phase alternating current, sixty (60) cycle, at one standard
utility secondary nominal voltage of 277/480V or 120/208V; or single-phase of a
nominal voltage of approximately 120/240V. If Consumer desires a voltage that
is impractical for Utility to furnish, Consumer shall furnish, at his expense,
the necessary transformers to deliver such voltage.
   (4)   Availability of 3-Phase Service: Normally, only single-phase service
is available. Utility may, at its option, furnish a 3-phase service, after
giving consideration to the investment required and probable use of 3-phase
service by Consumer; also providing Consumer enters into an appropriate
contract covering the investment involved.
      The minimum charge and financing of any 3-phase line extension shall
conform to Utility's Service Policy.
   (5)   Single Billing If Service is Supplied Through Single Service Drop:
Where service is supplied through a single service drop of either 3 or 4-wires
extending to a single service entrance and meter location designated by
Utility, a single bill will be rendered, whether or not Utility elects to use
single or multiple metering.
   (6)   Multiple Billing Where Service is Supplied Through Multiple Service
Drops: Where service is delivered at different meter locations through
individual and separately metered single and 3-phase service drops, a separate
bill will be rendered for each service drop location.
   (7)   Requirements to Qualify for Single Billing: If Consumer arranges his/
her wiring at his/her costs so that all requirements can be supplied by means
of a single 3 or 4-wire service drop extending to a single meter location
designated by Utility and providing that such service can be supplied from a
single transformer bank and metered through a single meter, a single bill will
be rendered for such service.
      Where a service drop supplies more than a single establishment, firm,
business or activity, each establishment, firm, business or activity shall be
separately metered and billed.
   (8)   3-Phase Service is Required for Unbalanced or Fluctuating Loads: For
highly fluctuating loads such as welders and electric melting furnaces and/or
unbalanced single-phase loads, Utility reserves the right to require Consumer
to operate such loads at 3-phase, with the loads balanced as far as practical,
substantially equal on each phase.
      To avoid voltage disturbances detrimental to the service furnished to
other Consumers, Utility reserves the right to install a separate transformer
to serve such fluctuating loads. In such an event, the Utility shall enter into
a contract to recover the costs of the separate and additional transformer and
associated equipment within an acceptable period, but not more than two and
one-half (2 ½) years.
   (9)   Term of Service: A minimum service term of twelve (12) months is
required under this rate schedule. A 12-month term of service shall renew
thereafter unless terminated by Consumer or Utility.
   (10)   Limitation of Schedule Commercial Secondary: Where individual or
unusual substation facilities are required to serve Consumer, or where the
required transformer capacity is 150 kVA or more, Utility may require Consumer
to install, own and operate, at his expense, the necessary complete substation
(consisting of transformer, structure, protective devices, etc.) required to
utilize service at Utility's specified untransformed Primary Voltage delivered
to Consumer's premises. The size, capacity and other Substation Specifications
shall be approved by Utility and the entire installation shall conform to
Utility specifications and standards.
   (11)   Motor Specifications: Single-phase service will not be furnished to
operate individual motors in excess of 15 HP rating, except where written
permission is granted by Utility. All motors 10 HP and larger, at Utility's
option, may be required to be equipped with reduced voltage starting equipment
or other devices to avoid unnecessary voltage surges and fluctuations on
Utility's system.
      Motors designed for full voltage "across the line" starting may, at
Utility's option, be permitted to operate on Utility's system, provided,
however, that Utility has determined that such operation will not be
detrimental to service furnished to others.
   (12)   Other Charges for Special Services: See Utility’s Service Policy as
to charges not set forth herein, applicable for the disconnection and
reconnection of service and the charges to be made for other special services
furnished to Consumer.
   (13)   New Line Extensions: All new line extensions or the furnishing of
additional capacity shall be subject to the Utility’s Service Policy covering
the same. Utility reserves the right to increase the minimum period of service
and/or increase the Minimum Charge where an unusual investment is required to
furnish service as compared to the estimated or probable revenue to be
received.
   (14)   Use of Service: Service under this Schedule shall not be resold or
shared with others. Any violation of this regulation shall be subject for the
service to be disconnected upon five (5) days' notice.
   (15)   Parallel Generation: Consumers are prohibited from operating an
electric generating facility in parallel with the Utility’s electric system
without an executed Interconnection Agreement. Installation of Consumer-owned
generation may not avoid the Utility’s recovery of unavoidable costs associated
with the Utility’s operation and maintenance and debt service expenses.

   (h)   POWER COST ADJUSTMENT RIDER “A”
Applicable:
The calculation of monthly bills pursuant to the rates and charges therein
shall be subject to adjustment for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased
power by applying a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) as a unit charge or credit to
the total billed energy kilowatt-hours (kWh) on the bill.
Overview:
This PCA calculation is intended to be based on forward-looking projections of
fuel, purchased power and other power supply-related costs, as well as
projections of Consumer sales (kWh), for the period. The calculation is further
intended to be performed at a minimum six-month interval or more frequently, if
required, to accomplish recovery of fuel-related cost in a timely manner. The
calculation includes a provision to reconcile over or under-collection of cost
from previous periods based on actual cost versus projected cost for the
period.
The PCA calculation shall be performed in a manner consistent with this rider
and initially set to a rate of zero at the time of implementing the herein base
rates. Thereafter, the PCA calculation shall be reviewed at a minimum every six
(6) months. The PCA calculation shall be reviewed and new projections shall be
made for the subsequent six-month periods (i.e., August and February of each
year). Following such PCA review and calculation, the PCA shall be applied, as
deemed necessary to accomplish recovery of the fuel, purchased power and other
power supply-related costs in a timely manner. The PCA shall be recalculated
and applied at intervals more frequent than six (6) months if actual fuel and
purchased power costs vary significantly from projections.
Definition of Fuel Cost:
The cost in dollars and cents of all projected fuel used in the production of
electric energy during the applicable time period determined from the projected
weighted average cost of such fuel applied to the projected quantity used. The
projected weighted average cost of fuel as used shall be defined as the cost of
fuel consumed in generating facilities priced at cost including freight,
demurrage, and taxes, of fuel on hand at the beginning of the applicable time
period, plus projected cost of fuel received during the applicable time period,
divided by the total quantity of fuel on hand and projected to be received.
Definition of Purchased Power Cost:
The net cost in dollars and cents of all projected purchased power required
during the applicable time period. The net cost of purchased power shall be the
projected total cost of power and energy received from suppliers and Utility
approved Consumer-owned renewable generation, including service and dispatch
fees and any power supply-related charges, less the projected amounts received
for off-system sales of energy.
Determination of PCA Unit Charge or Credit:
When fuel total cost and purchased power cost increases above or decreases
below $0.10006/kWh-sold, the rate for electric service shall be increased or
decreased in accordance with the following formula:
Calculation:              P +R
            PCA = -------------- - B
                S
Where:
PCA =    Power Charge factor, expressed in dollars per kWh-sold rounded to the
nearest five decimal places.
P =       Total projected fuel cost and projected purchased power cost during
the applicable time period expressed as dollars ($) as defined in this
schedule.
S =       Projected sales (kWh) excluding wholesale energy sales, for the
applicable time period for which the fuel cost and purchased power cost (P) is
computed.
R =       Reconciliation of the actual cumulative over or under-recovery of
fuel cost and purchased power cost from preceding applicable time periods
including over or under-recovery of fuel cost and purchased power cost before
the effective date of this Rider expressed as dollars ($).
B =       Base power supply cost for the schedule of rates and charges provided
by this section, B shall be $0.10006/kWh sold.
   (i)   OHIO EXCISE TAX RIDER “B”
The applicable Excise Tax shall be added to the total amount billed to the
Consumer under the applicable electric rate schedule. The Excise Tax rate shall
apply to the total energy sales (kWh) billed to the Consumer.
The Excise Tax is imposed on monthly Consumer energy sales (kWh) under Ohio
Revised Code
§5727.8 and any adjustments or amendments thereto.
The Excise Tax charge is to be applied to monthly Consumer energy sales (kWh)
on monthly electric bills using the following rates:
   First 2,000 kWh times $0.00465/kWh
   Next 13,000 kWh times $0.00419/kWh
   Over 15,000 kWh times $0.00363/kWh
The above rates are based on a 30-day billing cycle. If your billing cycle is
thirty (30) days exactly, the above-referenced rates will be used. If the
billing cycle is less than or more than thirty (30) days, the daily calculation
will be used.
The daily calculation will be determined as follows:
Determine the number of kWh used during the billing cycle; Divide that number
by the number of days in the billing cycle (Daily average kWh). Take the daily
average kWh and (for each block, round the tax amount to the nearest whole cent
(x.xx))
- Multiply $0.00465 for the first 67 kWh distributed;
- Multiply $0.00419 for the next 68 to 400 kWh distributed;
- Multiply $0.00363 for the remaining kWh distributed.
The tax is the sum of the above multiplied by the number of days in the billing
cycle

1111.02 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
      If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to such conditions which may
endanger health, life, or property; and if from investigations conducted by the
Commission, it is determined that, in the best interest of the public, the land
should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not
approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced by the
subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the development of
the land.
(Ord. 2017-19. Passed 12-4-17.)
1111.03 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   In order to provide areas suitably located and of adequate size for

require that all proposed residential subdivisions, equal to or greater than
ten acres, shall include a land reserve, dedicated to the City for public use.
The area of such land reserve shall be not less than four percent (4%) of the
total gross acreage shown on the subdivision plat. The reserve shall be
contiguous, shall be assessible to the general public. Where the plat to be
submitted is only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission
shall require a Master Plan of the entire tract, designating the disposition of
all lands contained therein, including the location of the proposed land
reserve. The area of the reserve will be based on the gross area of all lands
to be ultimately platted. The first plat to be submitted shall include the
dedication of the land reserved to public use. It shall also include the right-
of-way to and along the frontage of the proposed reserve. After the size,
location, and boundaries of the land reserve have been established and approved
by the Planning Commission, the Park and Recreation Commission shall meet with
the developer to determine the specific type of facility to be built. This
could range from a simple walking or jogging trail with the land left in its
natural state, to a complex recreational facility. The Commission's final
decision as to the scope and scale of the project shall be governed by the
following:
      (1)   The size and shape of the land reserve.
      (2)   The location of the land reserve with respect to other existing or
planned facilities.
      (3)   The topographic features of the site.
      (4)   The projected recreational needs of the planned development.
   Based on the outcome of this meeting, and at the discretion of the Park and
Recreation Commission, the developer shall submit a Recreational Site Plan to
the Planning Commission outlining the proposal and project cost. Such plan
shall be approved by the Commission, and the Parks and Recreation Commission.
Cost for City review by City Engineer/firm to be borne by developer.
   (b)   For subdivisions of less than ten acres and greater than one acre,
Commission and City may elect to accept a dollar amount equal to the 4% of
market value for use at other recreation sites.
   (c)    Neither the land reserve discussed in subsection (a) hereof nor the
trust deposit described in subsection (b) hereof shall be required for
subdivisions of a total acreage of less than one acre. (Ord. 2017-19. Passed
12-4-17.)
1111.04 EASEMENTS.

1113.18 STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
   (a)   The developer shall design and construct a storm water drainage system
to provide for the adequate movement and disposal of subsurface and surface
water. The developer shall provide for the maintenance of all natural drainage
courses and shall take adequate measures to protect future property owners from
undue and inordinate flooding. The cost to construct the stormwater drainage
system shall be borne by the developer of the subdivision.
   (b)   All design aspects and criteria for hydrology and hydraulics shall be
governed by the latest edition of "Standard Drainage Criteria Manual" for
Trumbull County, Ohio, except as may be modified herein. All construction and
materials specifications for manholes, inlets, catch basins, pipes, ditch
linings, headwalls, culverts, and bridges shall be governed by the appropriate
sections of the latest edition of the State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation, "Construction and Materials Specifications", except that no new
open drainage ditches or retaining basins shall be permitted, unless the
developer proves to the Planning Commission that such open drainage ditches or
retaining basins are necessary for proper storm water runoff control or that
strict adherence to the construction of storm sewers will not provide proper
storm water runoff control.
   (c)   The culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The City Engineer shall also study
the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Commission may withhold approval
of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of such
potential condition. When a proposed drainage system will carry across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
1113.19 SUMP PUMP AND ROOF DRAINS.
   The drainage system shall provide for sump pump and roof drain connections.
Water from these sources shall not be outlet on the ground or through the curb
but shall be connected to the pipe system, either directly or through the use
of a collector system. No storm drainage, including foundation drains, shall be
permitted to discharge into sanitary sewers.
1113.20 BACKYARD DRAINAGE.
   The developer shall indicate the disposition of all water falling on the
area bounded by the plat. This may require drainage pipes for backyard drainage
as directed by the City Engineer.
1113.21 STORM SEWER OUTLETS.
   Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat boundary, the
developer shall connect his system with such storm sewer line. If such a storm
sewer system is not accessible, natural drainage channels with easements of
adequate width shall be provided, as determined by the City Engineer and
approved by the Planning Commission. The cost to connect the storm sewer
outlets to the storm sewer system shall be borne by the developer of the
subdivision.
1113.22 ELECTRIC, GAS, AND TELEPHONE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Electric service and telephone service shall be provided within each
subdivision. Gas service may be used where reasonably accessible. Whenever such
facilities are reasonably accessible and available, they may be required to be
installed within the area prior to the approval of the final plat. Telephone,
electric, and street lighting wires, conduits and cables shall be constructed
underground except in cases where the City Engineer determines that topography,
bedrock, or underground water conditions would result in excessive costs to the
developer.
   (b)   All utilities shall be placed in the front of lots.
   (c)   Whenever a sanitary sewer line and electric and/or telephone line are
placed underground in the same utility easement, the following provisions shall
be applicable:

utilities, pavements, conduits, and other land improvements within the proposed
subdivision to serve adjacent or nearby lands which are now and may, in the
future, become an integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage area.
1113.24 EXTENSIONS TO BOUNDARIES.
   The developer shall be required to extend the necessary improvements to the
boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land, as
determined by the Planning Commission.
1113.25 OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS.
   If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, and if the City Planning Commission finds the extensions across
undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
developer may be required, prior to the approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary easements of rights-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by developers of adjoining
land on a cost reimbursement basis in compliance with ordinances of the City.
1113.26 SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
   (a)   No structure shall be inhabited until final grading has been completed
in accordance with the approved final subdivision plat and the lot pre-covered
with soil with an average depth of at least six inches which shall contain no
particles over two inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except
that portion covered by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade
has not been changed or natural vegetation seriously damaged. Top soil shall
not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be
redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at
least four inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be
stablized by seeding or plantings. No occupancy shall occur until respreading
of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between October 1
and March 15 and between May 15 and August 15, applicant shall submit an
agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property owner, that
respreading of soil and seeding of lawn will be done during the immediate
following planting season as set forth above. Sod may be used to comply with
any requirement of seeding set forth herein.
   (b)   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk,
rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or
left or deposited on any lot or street. Nor shall any be left or deposited in
any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond
or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
   (c)   Each developer shall be required to furnish and install fences
whenever the Planning Commission determines that a hazardous condition exists.
Fences shall be constructed according to local standards.
   (d)   The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion
of all requirements contained in this section of these Regulations including,
but not limited to soil preservation, grading, lot drainage, lawn grass
seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements
required by the Planning Commission. Whether or not a certificate of occupancy
has been issued, at the expiration of the performance bond, local government
may enforce the provisions of the bond where the provisions of this section or
any other applicable law or ordinance, or regulation has not been complied
with.

1115.01 VARIANCES.
   (a)   General. Where the Planning Commission finds extraordinary hardships
or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
Regulations and/or the purposes of these Regulations may be served to a greater
extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
Subdivision Regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these Regulations; and further provided
the Planning Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
      (2)   The conditions upon which requests for variances are based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
      (3)   Because of particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of these Regulations are carried out; however, in no case will financial
hardship be considered grounds for a variance.
   (b)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these Regulations.
   (c)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider when the site plan is filed for consideration with
the Planning Commission. In the case of a minor subdivision, such petition for
variances shall be submitted at the time of filing for a final plat approval.
The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the

1151.12 MEASUREMENT DETERMINATIONS.
   The following directives shall be the basis for determining sign area, sign
height, and building or tenant frontage.
   (a)    The sign area and dimensions shall include the entire face of the
sign from edge to edge, including any frame or structure around the perimeter
of the sign.
      (1)    For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements
on a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregular shaped
free-standing sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than
three (3) adjacent regular geometric shapes that encompasses the perimeter of
all the elements in the display. Regular geometric shapes are squares,
rectangles, circles, ovals, triangles, and trapezoids.
      (2)    When separate elements are organized to form a single sign but the
elements are separated by open space, the area of the sign shall include the
space between the elements.
      (3)    The sign area for a multi-faced sign is calculated based on the
principle that all sign elements can be seen at one time or from one vantage
point should be considered in measuring that side of the sign.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3220_6552x3354.jpg]
      (1)    The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces when two identical display faces are joined, are parallel, or are within
sixty (60) degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point
separated by a distance that exceeds two feet.
      (2)    The portion of a solid sign base, up to a maximum height of two
(2) feet, may be excluded from the calculated sign area, provided such base is
adequately screened by landscaping.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3223_3048x3678.jpg]
   (c)    Projecting Signs. Air between a projecting sign and the wall to which
it is attached and detached lighting fixtures and associated brackets shall not
be included in the calculation of sign area.
   (d)    Wall Signs. The area of a of a wall sign or other sign with only one
face shall be computed by the means of the smallest rectangle that will
encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other
display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign form the backdrop
or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supportive
framework, base, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such a fence or wall
meets the regulations of this chapter and is clearly incidental to the display
itself. For a single wall sign on a single-occupant building, all pieces of
information or other graphic representations on that wall shall be measured as
though part of one sign, encompassed within one rectangle that may not exceed
ten percent (10%) of the total wall area to which the sign is affixed. For a
single wall of a multi-occupant building, the area of signs shall be computed
using these principles and the total of all signs shall not exceed ten percent
(10%) of the total wall area to which the signs are affixed.
      (1)    A single wall shall mean the entire wall that shares the same
architectural elevation as shown on the approved site plan. Architectural
elevations are typically defined as the front, sides, and rear of a building.
      (2)    Regardless of whether a single wall has wall sections that
project, recess, or otherwise vary from the predominate wall plane, the
rectangle shall include all signs that appear on the same architectural
elevation.
      (3)    For multi-occupant buildings with in-line tenants, all signs
associated with a given occupant shall be enclosed with a single rectangle for
purposes of calculating allowable sign area.
      (4)    For multi-occupant buildings, where occupants are not aligned in a
row (with each occupant having a separate outside entrance), all pieces of
information or other graphic representations on that wall which relate to an
individual occupant or business within the building shall be measured as though
part of one sign. The total area of all individual signs will be allowed to
occupy no more space than ten percent (10%) of the total wall area to which the
signs are affixed.
   (e)    Sign Height. The height of a free-standing ground sign shall be
measured from the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support
structure to the tallest element of the sign or its support structure. A free-
standing ground sign on a man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall
be measured from the average site grade prior to any grade change in the area
of a sign. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign
height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal
grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of
the crown of a public or private street.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3226_4440x2934.jpg]
   (f)    Building Frontage and Building Unit. Building frontage shall mean the
horizontal length of a building on the side with its principle entrance. If
that side has a straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length
of the wall. If the side is not a straight wall, the building frontage shall be
the horizontal distance to the corner at one end of the side of the building
with the principal entrance to the other corner of the same side of the
building; where that side of the building is concave, then the measurement
shall be made in a straight line from corner to corner; and where the side of
the building is convex or has one or more sections that project in front of the
front corners, then the measurement shall be made as the shortest distance
between the two (2) lines projected from the two (2) front corners of the
building, with such lines parallel to each other and as close as practicable to
perpendicular to the front of the building. (Ord. 2022-42. Passed 10-5-22.)
1151.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    All signs shall be of substantial construction so as to withstand
weather conditions such as rain, snow, wind, and freezing and thawing, without
deterioration of the sign or its structure. Cloth, paper, or any other
temporary materials shall not be permitted on permanent signs.

      (1)    Signs may be internally illuminated with LED’s or similar
technology, provided that the sign shall be factory set so that the luminance
of the sign shall not exceed a maximum of three (3) foot candles measured ten
(10) feet from the sign’s face at maximum brightness. Internally illuminated
signs shall be equipped with a reduced intensity nighttime setting device
activated by photocell or timer.
      (2)    External illumination of signs shall not be of excessive
brightness and shall be designed and shielded so as to prevent glare and
minimize light trespass onto adjacent properties and prevent view of the light
source from any adjoining residential property and/or vehicles traveling on
public rights-of-way. In no instance shall the intensity of the light exceed
twenty foot candles at any point on the sign face.
      (3)    No sign shall be illuminated between the hours of 2:30 a.m. and 5:
00 a.m., unless the activity displaying the sign is open for business during
those hours. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to grant an exception from
the provisions of this section to any activity in which illumination of signs
during the hours otherwise proscribed is necessary or desirable for the
security and safety of the activity or property.
   (e)    Electronic message, multiple message, and variable message signs that
are changed electronically shall conform to the following standards:

hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.;
      (6)    Each such sign must be capable of regulating the digital display
intensity, and the light intensity level of the display must automatically
adjust to natural ambient light conditions;
      (7)    No such sign shall be of such intensity as to create a distraction
or nuisance for motorists;
      (8)    Displays shall not emulate traffic control devices;
      (9)    Such signs shall contain a default design that will freeze the
sign in one position or cause it to go dark if a malfunction occurs;
      (10)    The entire message shall change at once, without scrolling,
animation, flashing, blinking or other movement or noise.
   (f)    The changeable copy portion of any free-standing ground sign or wall
sign shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total area of the sign.
   (g)    Temporary signs shall not be illuminated.
   (h)    Signs not visible or intended to be read from off the premises are
exempt from these regulations.
   
   (i)    All signs shall be erected entirely on private property with no part
of said sign extending over the public street or right of way.
   (j)    Clear Sight Triangle. No sign shall be erected in the clear sight
triangle as defined by the Zoning Ordinance. The sight triangle is a
triangular-shaped portion of land established at street intersections and
driveways in which nothing is erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in
such a manner as to limit or obstruct the sight distance of motorists entering
or leaving the intersection. Dimensions for the clear sight triangle are shown
in the following diagram:

IMAGES/0-0-0-3229_6360x3270.jpg]
   (k)    All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in
compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this
chapter. Specifically:
      (1)    Any permanent sign, supports, and lighting which advertises a
business no longer conducted on the premises, fails to serve the purposes for
which it was intended, or evidences a lack of maintenance, shall be removed by
the owner, agent, or person having the beneficial use of the building,
structure, or land upon which such sign is located. If not removed by the
owners or occupants of the property within thirty (30) days of the notice of
same, the Zoning Administrator shall cause the signs to be otherwise removed,
and the cost of the removal shall be billed to the property owner;
      (2)    A sign shall have no more than twenty percent (20%) of its surface
area covered with disfigured, cracked, ripped, or peeling paint, poster paper,
or other material for a period of more than thirty (30) days;

      (7)    Upon determination that a sign is not being maintained, is in poor
condition or repair, or is unsafe, the Zoning Administrator may order such sign
to be brought into compliance or removed within a specified time period. Should
the property owner fail to bring the sign into compliance as directed, the
Zoning Administrator may remove (or cause to be removed) or maintain such sign
at the expense of the person, firm or corporation who erected the sign or on
whose premises it was erected, affixed, or attached. Each such person, firm, or
corporation shall be individually and separately liable for the expense
incurred in the removal of the sign. In the event of nonpayment of the removal
expenses, the Zoning Administrator may request Council to certify any unpaid
removal expenses to the County Auditor for placement on the tax duplicate for
the subject property. The Zoning Administrator may also institute an
injunction, mandamus, abatement, or other appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove such violation.

permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any
manner. It is further provided that the Zoning Administrator may require a
plat, deed, or other documentation necessary to show that remote parking space
is controlled by and available to applicant prior to the granting of a Zoning
Certificate.
   (d)   Design of Parking Area. All off-street parking except off-street
parking for single- family detached dwelling units, single-family attached
dwelling units on adjoining individual lots, or two-family dwellings located on
a residential service street, shall be designed so that vehicles can turn
around within the area and enter the street, road, or highway in such a manner
as to completely eliminate the necessity of backing into the street, road or
highway. Off-street parking for single-family detached dwelling units, shingle-
family attached dwelling units on adjoining individual lots, or two-family
attached dwelling units, which requires backing into a residential service
street shall be permitted provided that such movement can be made with

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

Official may be appealed and establishes a separate board of appeals to hear
said appeals.
   City Council has reviewed this provision and is satisfied that the Planning
and Zoning Commission, established by the Charter and empowered by the City’s
Zoning Ordinance, is qualified to handle appeals under the Property Maintenance
Code, and therefore it is redundant and unnecessary to establish an appeals
board.
   Section 108 is hereby amended as follows: Section 108.1, Membership of the
Board. The Board of Appeals shall be the Newton Falls Planning and Zoning
Commission.

1325.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Newton Falls, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Newton Falls has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Newton Falls as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Newton Falls.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective June 18, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Newton Falls as required by Section
1325.04(c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 19 N. Canal Street, Newton Falls, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Newton Falls, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2010-
14. Passed 5-3-10.)
1325.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Newton Falls’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not  amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Newton Falls
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 1, 1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1325.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Newton
Falls, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Newton Falls have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Newton Falls’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Newton Falls boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of Newton Falls suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Newton Falls has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1325.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Newton Falls specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1325.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by Trumbull
County.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Trumbull Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

   (f)   The drainage plan shall in each case be designed to provide a facility
large enough to accommodate potential run-off from its entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the property being developed. The plan will
also study the effect of each construction on existing downstream drainage
facilities outside the area of construction. Where it is anticipated that the
additional run-off incident to the development of the property will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, approval may be withheld until the
provisions has been made for the improvement of such potential condition. When
a proposed drainage system will carry across private land outside of the
proposed development, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and recorded.
   (g)   The plan approved by the City Engineer with any additions, corrections

            (Ord. 2005-09. Passed 4-4-05.)
1340.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one  Within 7 days of the most recent

Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1.
winter.
 
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from the
Newton Falls Engineer.
   The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic yards
of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining the
total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is not co- mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling pond must be
less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one
unit of width (> 2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the
sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres)    Range of Slope for a
to 100 linear feet of silt fence drainage area (%)
0.5                              <2%
0.25                             > 2% but < 20%
0.125                            > 20% but < 50%
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2” in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
   Based on site conditions, Newton Falls Engineer may require additional best
management practices to control off site tracking and dust. These additional
BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1340.09(g) of this chapter.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Newton Falls Engineer may require
dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required. Qualified
inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Newton Falls or an alternate form
acceptable to the Newton Falls Engineer.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non- compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Newton Falls Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.

   The intent of the small wind project resolutions to establish guidelines for
the location of small wind projects in City of Newton Falls. The City
recognizes in some specific instances and under carefully controlled
circumstances, it may be in the public interest to permit the placement of
small wind projects consisting of one unit less than 5MW in certain areas of
the City. The Council Members also recognize the need to protect the scenic
beauty of the City from unnecessary and unreasonable visual interference, noise
radiation and environmental impacts and
that small wind projects may have negative health, safety, welfare and
aesthetic impacts upon adjoining and neighboring uses. As such, this regulation
intends to:
   (a)   Protect residential and agricultural areas from any potential adverse
impact from wind turbines.

   (a)   Accessory Structure: Structures such as sheds, storage sheds, pool
houses, unattached garages and barns
   (b)   Anemometer: An instrument that measures force and direction of wind.
   (c)   Clear fall zone:  An area surrounding the wind turbine unit, in which
the wind turbine and/or components might fall due to inclement weather, poor
maintenance, faulty construction methods, or any other condition causing
turbine failure, that shall remain unobstructed and confined within the
property lines of the primary parcel where the turbine is located. The purpose
of the clear fall zone is such that if the turbine should fall or otherwise
become damaged, the falling structure will be confined to the primary parcel.
   (d)   Cowling: A streamlined removable cover that encloses the turbine's
nacelle.
   (e)   Decibel: A unit of relative sound equal to ten times the common
logarithm of the ratio of two readings. For sound, decibel scales run from zero
for the least perceptible to 130 for sound that causes pain.
   (f)   Mono-pole tower: A single piece tower that is placed on a minimum size
6 feet x 6 feet concrete pad, constructed with 8.5 cubic yards of concrete, and
buried at 48 inches.
   (g)   Nacelle: Sits atop the tower and contains the essential mechanical
components of the turbine to which the rotor is attached.
   (h)   Primacy structure: For each property, the structure that one or more,
persons occupy the majority of the time on that property for either business or
personal reasons. Primary structures include residences, commercial buildings,
hospitals, and day care facilities. Primary structures xclude structures such
as hunting sheds, storage sheds, pool houses, garages and barns.

1529.01 SECURING REMOVAL THROUGH PAYMENT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedures described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86 C and D, whereby no insurance company, doing business in the State
of Ohio, shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage, to a structure
located in the City, whereby the amount recovered for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies, exceed the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000)
unless there is a compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer to the City Manager in the aggregate one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
each twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or
insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. Such
transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies insuring the
building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to
the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms. The named
insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after the
transfer, and the City Manager shall return the amount of the fund in excess of
the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the City has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds of the City as authorized by this section,
the City Manager shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred
by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (1)   When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof,
an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the
named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured
or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City and
notify them that the following procedures will be followed.
      (2)   The fund shall be returned to the named insured and insureds when
repair, removal or securing of the building or other structure has been
completed and the required proof received by the City Manager, if the City has
not incurred any costs for such repair, removal or securing. If the City has
incurred any costs for repair, removal, or securing of the building or other
structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain,
the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to
recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to prohibit the City and the named insured or insureds from
entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named
insured or insureds if some other reasonable deposition of the damaged property
has been negotiated.
   (c)   The City Manager is hereby designated as the office authorized to
carry out the duties of this section. The City Manager shall file a certified
copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of Ohio.
