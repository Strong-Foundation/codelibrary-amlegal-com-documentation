EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the Village of Hunting Valley, State of Ohio, in order to

the manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio, except that no

municipality be annexed to, or merged with, any other body politic, nor shall
the corporate existence of the municipality be terminated, without the consent
of the Council of the municipality and of a majority of its electors voting on
such question at a general election.
ARTICLE II
POWERS OF THE MUNICIPALITY
SECTION II-1. POWERS.

exercised by municipal corporations under the Constitution and laws of the
State of Ohio.
SECTION II-2. MANNER OF EXERCISE.
   The powers of this municipality shall be exercised in the manner prescribed
in this Charter or, if not prescribed herein, then in such manner as the
Council may determine. When not prescribed in this Charter or determined by
Council, such powers shall be exercised, except as a contrary intent appears in
this Charter or in the enactments of Council, in such manner as may now or
hereafter be provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio.
ARTICLE III
COUNCIL
SECTION III-1. NUMBER AND TERM.
   The Council shall consist of six members elected at large for terms of four
years, except as herein provided, commencing on the first day of January next
following their election.
   During the year 1969, the Council shall consist of the present members of
Council, or any successor appointed to fill a vacancy in such term. During the
years 1970 and 1971, the Council shall consist of the two persons elected to
Council for four-year terms at the November 7, 1967, regular municipal
election, or any successor appointed to fill a vacancy in such term, and four
persons elected at the regular municipal election in 1969, of which the three
candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall serve for four years and
the candidate receiving the fourth highest number of votes shall serve for two
years. Thereafter, the Council shall consist of six members, three of whom

year thereafter, and three of whom shall be elected in 1973 and every fourth
year thereafter.

involving moral turpitude, or if adjudicated legally incompetent, or for a
violation of his oath of office, or persistent failure to abide by the rules of
the Council; provided, however, that such removal shall not take place without
the affirmative vote of four members of Council nor until the accused shall
have been notified in writing of the charge against him at least ten days in
advance of a public hearing upon such charge, and he or his counsel has been

the members of the Council shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at any meeting of the Council, but a lesser number may adjourn the

ordinance or resolution may be passed or adopted, or any other action may be
taken, by the affirmative vote of four members of the Council unless a larger
number be required by the provisions of this Charter. The Clerk of Council
shall keep a record of its proceedings in a journal in which the yea or nay
vote of each Councilman voting on every ordinance or resolution, and the action
of Council on other measures, shall be recorded. All meetings of the Council

dispensed with by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of Council;
(e)    The procedure for making public improvements and levying assessments,
including the procedure for combining two or more public improvements, and the
levying of assessments therefor, in one proceeding if the Council finds that it

majority of the foot frontage of the property benefitted and to be specially
assessed therefor, and (d) any emergency ordinance or resolution necessary for

   If he shall cease to possess or if he violates any of the qualifications
herein enumerated, he may be removed from office, but failure to maintain said

opportunity at such hearing to be heard, present evidence, and examine any
witness appearing in support of the charge.
SECTION IV-4. ABSENCE AND VACANCY.
   (a)    Temporary Incapacity. When the Mayor is, for any reason, unable to
perform the duties of Mayor, the President pro tem of Council shall become the

Mayor for that term as provided above.

officer. Neither the Chief of Police nor any police officer who has received
his final appointment shall be suspended for a period in excess of sixty days
during any calendar year or discharged from employment in the Police
Department, except for the causes and under the procedures provided by the laws
of the State of Ohio with respect to the removal of a police chief or police
officer.
      (2)    With respect to all other officers and employees of the
municipality, the Mayor shall have the power to discipline, suspend, transfer,

subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
(1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action taken
thereunder;
(2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or liability
previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
(c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
(2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings of
Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

(3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
(4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
(1)   The object sought to be attained;
(2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
(3)   The legislative history;
(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL CODE PENALTY; COMPLICITY.

failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates or fails to comply with any such provision
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months,

day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless
otherwise provided.

Ordinances, or a rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under authority
of either, or under authority of State law, and shall be in addition to any
equitable remedy provided by a provision of these Codified Ordinances, or a
provision of a technical or other code adopted by reference in these Codified
Ordinances, or a rule, regulation or order promulgated or made under authority
of either, or under authority of State law, or provided by State law, including
the enforced removal of prohibited conditions.
   (c)    Complicity. Every person concerned in the commission of an offense
under these Codified Ordinance, whether he or she directly commits the act
constituting the offense or procures, counsels, aids or abets in its

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter 103. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

   105.01 CONTRACT PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Proper Authorization. No contract, or an amendment or a change order
to a contract, shall be enforceable against the Village unless it has been duly
authorized, as provided for herein, and executed in the name of the Village by

the extent required by the Ohio Revised Code, certifying the availability and
appropriation of funds for the contract or any amendment or change order to the

authority to investigate costs relative to any proposed public improvement or
any proposed purchase or lease of equipment, supplies, services or materials.
   (c)    Authorization for Design and/or Specifications. In the event the
investigation or a good faith estimate by the Mayor indicates that a proposed
project, purchase, lease or provision of services will exceed seventy-five
thousand dollars ($75,000), the approval of Council by a motion and majority
vote is necessary to authorize the expenditure of funds for the design and/or
specification thereof.
   (d)    Public Bidding. Except as provided in subsection (e), any contract
which: (i) provides for an expenditure in excess of the amount authorized under
Ohio Revised Code Section 9.17, which shall be the amount of seventy five
thousand dollars ($75,000) during the calendar year, 2024, and for each
calendar year thereafter, the amount of the previous calendar year increased by
three percent (3%) as determined and published by the director of commerce for
the State of Ohio; and, (ii) is for the construction of a public improvement or
the purchase or lease of equipment, supplies or materials, or the provision of
a service to the Village, shall be authorized only upon a motion, adopted by a
majority vote of the members of Council, to award the contract to the lowest
and best bidder after advertising for a time and in a manner that the Village
determines shall be effective in notifying sufficient number of bidders as
determined by the Village in its discretion. By way of example, and not as a
limitation, the advertisement may be in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Village, or publication on the Village's website, or both.
   (e)    Exceptions to Public Bidding. Contracts estimated to exceed the
threshold amount as described in division (d) above, as authorized under Ohio
Revised Code Section 9.17, are not
subject to competitive bidding and may be approved by Council, in its
discretion, by motion and
a majority vote of its members so long as the contract meets any of the
following conditions:
      (1)    Personal or Professional Services. Except as provided in Section
105.05, contracts that involve personal services requiring unique and special
skills, as determined by Council in its discretion, or professional services;
      (2)    Co-op Programs. Contracts authorized pursuant to the Ohio
Department of Administrative Services Cooperative Purchasing Program, a
consortium of political subdivisions, or any other similar program
("cooperative program"), or goods, materials or equipment which are available
under a cooperative program but are available to the Village upon equivalent or
better conditions and specifications, and at the same or lower price than is
available, under the cooperative program;
      (3)    Design Build. The proposed purchase is a Design-Build Construction
project let under the procedures established by Council;
      (4)    Construction-Manager at-Risk. The proposed purchase is a
Construction Manager-at-Risk project let under the procedures established by
Council;
      (5)    Single source. The proposed purchase is for something that, as
determined at the sole-discretion of the Council, is only available from a
single source;
      (6)    No Bids/Rejected Bids. If no bids are received after the
advertisements or other solicitations required by this Ordinance, or if all
bids are rejected, the Mayor shall either seek new, competitive bids, or seek
to obtain the goods and/or services for which funds have been appropriated
without re-bidding, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the
Village;
      (7)    Used Equipment. The proposed purchase is for used equipment;
      (8)    Utility. The proposed purchase is for utilities such as gas,
water, electricity, or telephone service for which funds have been
appropriated; notwithstanding other provisions of this section, Council shall
authorize such purchases pursuant to an ordinance;
      (9)    Intergovernmental Purchases. The proposed purchase is from or with
another political subdivision, the Ohio State Government, or the United States
Government;
      (10)   Reverse Auction. The proposed purchase is obtained through Reverse
Auction;
      (11)   Best Interest Waiver. Council may, at its sole-discretion, waive
the public bidding requirement if it determines that doing so is in the best
interest of the Village.
   (f)    Mayor's Discretionary Spending Authority. The Mayor may expend up to
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), in accordance with the Village's current
appropriations, for any public improvement, or the purchase or lease of
equipment, materials and supplies, or to obtain professional or personal
services or for any other lawful purpose. The Mayor shall notify Council of
such expenditure at the next meeting of Council.
   (g)    Real Estate. The Mayor may purchase, sell or lease real property
valued below fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), provided that a current
appropriation supports any such purchase or lease of real estate and provided
that Council is notified of such purchase, sale or lease at the time of the
next Council meeting. The Council may, by ordinance, provide for the purchase,
sale or lease of real property, valued at or in excess of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000), with or without public bidding, on such terms and for such
value as Council, in the exercise of its discretion, may deem reasonable and in
the best interest of the Village.
   (h)    Time Between Notice of Public Bidding and Bid Opening. There shall be
no minimum time requirement between the publishing of the notice of public
bidding and the opening of the bids.
   (i)    Estimate of Cost. The Village shall disclose the estimated cost of
the project when it determines that doing so is in its best interest.
   (j)   Time for Award of Bids. In the notice of public bidding required for
the bid solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit for awarding a
contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this period. The Village's
failure to award and execute the contract within this period invalidates the
entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time for awarding and
executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the Village and the
bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with respect to whom the Village
subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension shall not
entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (k)    Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to Section
9.31 of the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the Village's
right to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (l)   Bids in Excess of Estimate. The Village may award contracts regardless
of the value of the bid as compared to the value of the estimated cost.
   (m)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to
proceed with the work by the Village or its representative upon execution of
the contract. The Village shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time
that it determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract
for its convenience.
   (n)    Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
contractor at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage
shall not be held in an escrow account.
Retainage shall be released at such times and in such amounts as the Village
determines to be equitable, and no interest shall be payable on retained funds.
   (o)   General Contractor Permitted. The Village may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
   (p)    Extension of Bid Opening. The Village may issue an addendum or
addenda modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for
the bid opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued
within forty-eight (48) hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be
extended by at least three (3) days.
   (q)    Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The Village at its
discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (r)    Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a bonus
for completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.

   149.01 EMPLOYER PICK-UP OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OHIO OPERS AND OP&F.
   The Village hereby adopts the following policies and procedures to perform
the “employer pick-up” of employee contributions to the Ohio Public Employee
Retirement System (OPERS) and the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OP&F):
(a)   For the categories of Village employees listed in subsection (b) hereof,
the contributions required to be made by each such employee to the OPERS or
OP&F, whichever is applicable, as an employee contribution under Ohio R.C.
Chapters 145 and 742 shall be paid, pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, by the
Village on behalf of the employee in lieu of contribution by the employees and
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (b)   This section shall apply to all Village officials and/or employees in
the following categories: Police Department personnel, Service Department
personnel, support personnel, elected officials, appointed officials, and all
other employees who are not members of the above groups. An official or
employee who wishes to have contributions made on a pre-tax basis shall sign a
form requesting same; this option shall be irrevocable.
      (Ord. 2003-118. Passed 6-10-03.)
   (c)   The Village’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in OPERS and OP&F shall be as follows, in order to provide for a
salary reduction pick up of employee contributions to OPERS or OP&F:
      (1)   The total salary for each eligible employee shall be the salary
otherwise payable under the Village policies. Such total salary of each
employee shall be payable by the Village in two parts:
         A.   Deferred salary; and
         B.   Cash salary.
      (2)   An eligible employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that
percentage of that employee’s total salary which is required from time to time
by OPERS or OP&F to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and
shall be paid by the Village to OPERS or OP&F on behalf of that employee as a
pick up and in lieu of OPERS or OP&F employee contribution otherwise payable by
that employee. Employees shall not have the option of receiving the statutorily
required contribution directly instead of it being paid by the Village to OPERS
or OP&F.
         (Ord. 2007-121. Passed 11-13-07.)
(d)   Such employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total
salary less the amount of the pick up for that employee, and shall be payable,
subject to applicable payroll deductions to that employee.
(1)   The Village shall compute and remit its employer contributions to OPERS
or OP&F based upon an employee’s total salary. The total combined expenditures
of the Village for such employee’s total salaries payable under applicable
Village policies and the pick up provisions of this section shall not be
greater that the amounts the employee would have been paid for those items had
this provision not been in effect.
(2)   A person electing this pick up deduction shall not have the option of
choosing to receive the payroll deduction directly instead of having this
deduction picked up by the Village. Members who have elected to participate in
this plan cannot increase, decrease or terminate the amount of the pick up
deduction.
(e)   All full-time Village employees identified in subsection (b) hereof and
who are contributing members of OPERS or OP&F may purchase additional service
credit, tax deferred, and the Village shall withhold the required service
credit deduction from the gross pay of each person who elects to do so and
shall pick up (assume and pay) such deduction to OPERS or OP&F in accordance
with subsection (c) hereof. This provision shall be effective June 10, 2003.
(f)   The Finance Director and Assistant Finance Director are hereby authorized
to perform all acts necessary and appropriate to facilitate the implementation
of the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, making
applications to the Internal Revenue Service for private letter rulings
concerning Federal tax treatment of the provisions of this plan and making
applications to the appropriate State retirement boards.

   149.02  USE OF VILLAGE OWNED VEHICLES.
   (a)    All Village owned vehicles shall be used only for the performance of
Municipal services and shall be kept or garaged on Village property.
   (b)    The Chief of Police, the Service Director or the Building Inspector
may be required by the Mayor to keep or garage a Village owned vehicle at his
or her residence at night and to use it to commute to and from work, so as to
be able to respond promptly and effectively to calls for emergency services
during off-duty hours.
   (c)    All such vehicles shall be clearly marked to indicate ownership by
the Village, except the unmarked police car used by the Chief of Police for
police work in which an unmarked vehicle is essential.
   (d)    This section confirms and records an unwritten policy heretofore in
effect and enforced prior to 1985 and shall take effect and be in force from
and after its passage.

disciplinary action, pursuant to his authority to discipline an employee
granted by Article IV, Section 5(b) of the Village Charter. No more than five
(5) days pay may be withheld as a fine in any pay period, but a fine may be

in the respective pay period for determining overtime compensation.

health plan, the Village's premium for the HDHP, and the employee's single,
employee-spouse, employee-child(ren) or family insurance plan coverage. Any
change in an employee's health insurance coverage during the calendar year
shall result in a recalculation of any contribution to an employee's HSA.
   (c)    The Mayor and Finance Director shall promulgate rules and regulations
necessary for the implementation of a Village HSA program, including a schedule
for Village payments, and they are hereby authorized to enter into an agreement
with a third party administrator and other necessary partners, as approved by
motion of the Council, as may be necessary to create, administer, and maintain

dollars to a Village HSA.

ensuring that contributions to a Village HSA do not exceed maximum annual
contribution limits. The Village is not responsible for any penalties, taxes,
or expenses associated with an employee's HSA.

some cases by check, a percentage of the cost of said insurance coverage and
the Village will pay the balance. The Council shall by motion, from time to
time, determine the percentage of the cost of said insurance coverage for which
the employee will be responsible. The Mayor and Finance Director are authorized
to maintain a Section 125 plan, in conformance with applicable Internal Revenue
Code requirements, which will permit all eligible payments or deductions to be
made on a pre-tax basis.
   (f)    The cost of a term life insurance policy ($20,000 face value) shall
be paid by the Village for each full-time employee.
(Ord. 2019-12. Passed 11-12-19.)
   149.12  HOLIDAYS.
   (a)   All full-time employees of the Village shall be entitled to ninety
(90) hours of holiday leave per calendar year, which shall be permitted leave
from work for days that would have otherwise been scheduled work days. Said
holiday leave may be scheduled at any time during the calendar year, subject to
approval by the Department Head. When necessary to maintain the efficient
operation of the Village, employee seniority shall be utilized.
   (b)   All holiday hours for full-time employees are granted January 1 of
each calendar year.
   (c)   Holiday leave shall be taken annually and shall not carry over into
the following calendar year. The Village reserves the right to schedule or

when such action is warranted to meet the safe and efficient needs of the
Village.

reason shall be entitled to holiday leave on a pro-rata basis for each full
month of service (e.g., an employee who leaves at the end of June has earned
one-half of the year’s holiday leave; an employee hired in March shall receive
sixty-seven and five-tenths (67.5) hours.
   (e)   Upon termination for any reason, the employee, or the employee’s
estate in the event of death, shall be paid for all granted unused holiday
hours remaining in the year of termination. If an employee who terminates
employment during a calendar year has used more than the employee’s pro-rata
share of holiday leave, that employee shall have deducted from the final
paycheck the amount representing the holiday pay used but not yet earned.
   (f)   The Mayor may reduce any employee’s holiday hours, in the current or
any immediately subsequent calendar year, as a disciplinary action, pursuant to
the authority to discipline an employee granted by Article IV,
Section 5(b) of the Village Charter.

   149.13 VACATIONS.
   (a)   Each full-time employee of the Village, whether paid a salary or on an
hourly basis, shall be entitled to earn vacation hours with pay during each
calendar year of continuous employment with the Village. Vacation hours are
earned not granted. Vacation hours that are used during the current calendar
year were earned during the preceding year. Therefore, an employee hired during
any part of a year, other than January 1, will earn a pro-rated entitlement,
for the following year. This pro-rated entitlement is derived from the Vacation
Hours Guideline for New Employees, below. During the balance of the first year
of hire the employee will have earned no days of vacation. Starting January 1
of the second year of employment, the employee will receive a pro-rated
entitlement as described in Vacation Hours Guideline for New Employees.
Starting January 1 of the second full year of employment, the employee will
receive eighty (80) working hours of vacation with pay. A full-time employee
who has completed five (5) calendar years of continuous employment with the
Village shall be entitled to earn one hundred twenty (120) working hours
vacation with pay. A full-time employee who has completed twelve (12) calendar
years of continuous employment with the Village shall be entitled to earn one
hundred sixty (160) working hours vacation with pay. The Chief of Police and
the Lieutenant of the Police Department shall be entitled to earn two hundred
(200) working hours vacation with pay.
   (b)    Vacation hours may not be carried over from year to year. For the
purpose of computing the number of vacation hours to which an employee is
entitled hereunder, each such employee shall receive credit for periods of his
employment with the State of Ohio or any other political subdivision of the
State, as and to the extent required by law. Additional credit for prior
periods of employment, if any, shall be as approved by Council at the time of
appointment. Except by written authorization of the Mayor or Chief of Police,
vacations must be taken in full eight (8) or ten (10) hour days.
   (c)   For the purpose of computing the employee’s starting date to determine
the number of weeks of vacation entitlement, refer to Mayor’s New Employee
Appointment Sheet.   
   (d)   The amount of vacation a full-time Police Officer is entitled to in
the following calendar year shall be reduced by 1/12th of each seventeen (17)
work days that the employee is in the inactive pay status. The amount of
vacation any other full-time employee is entitled to in the following calendar
year shall be reduced by 1/12 for each twenty-one (21) work days that the
employee is in the inactive pay status.
   (e)   Active pay status is defined to include hours for which wages are paid
by the Village for services provided, vacation hours, holiday hours, sick
leave, bereavement leave, or paid administrative leave. Inactive pay status
includes all periods when an employee is not receiving wages designated in the
active pay status. Injury leaves where an employee receives payments from the
Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, or all other unpaid leave of absences are
considered inactive pay status for purposes of earning vacation.
   (f)   A new employee whose service terminates for any reason prior to one
full year from date of appointment, shall not be entitled to receive payment
for any unused vacation.
   (g)   An employee whose service terminates for any reason after completing
more than one full year of service from date of appointment, shall be entitled
to be compensated for any earned unused vacation hours, including vacation
hours earned and unused during the calendar year of termination.
   (h)   (Reserved).
   (i)   The Mayor may reduce any employee’s vacation hours in the current or
any immediately subsequent calendar year as a disciplinary action, pursuant to
his authority to discipline an employee granted by Article IV,
Section 5(b) of the Village Charter.
(Ord. 2016-22. Passed 11-15-16.)
   149.14 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Each full-time employee of the Village of Hunting Valley, whether paid
a salary or on an hourly basis, shall be entitled to accumulate sick leave at
the rate of 4.62 hours for each 80 hours in active pay status. Such employee
shall be eligible to use accumulated sick leave after being employed for three
(3) months. Sick hours used shall be charged against hours earned and
accumulated in inverse order.
   (b)   Sick leave is defined as leave with pay granted to a full-time
employee who is necessarily absent from duty due to illness, pregnancy, or
injury which renders such employee unable to perform his or her regular duties
or any other duties which could be assigned by such employee's supervisor or
responsible administrative officer, or exposure to a contagious disease which
could be communicated to other employees. Sick leave may also be granted due to
an illness or injury in the employee’s immediate family where the employee’s
presence is medically necessary to care for the family member. Immediate family
shall be defined as the employee’s spouse, parent or child or other member of
the employee’s household as approved by the Village.
   (c)    Sick leave may be utilized only with the approval of such full-time
employee's supervisor or responsible administrative officer upon receipt of
notice of at least two (2) hours prior to the time such employee would normally
report for duty. A full-time employee who is absent for four or more
consecutive days or who is admitted to a hospital, must submit a doctor’s
report to such employee’s supervisor or other responsible administrative
officer upon returning to work. The supervisor or responsible administrative
officer may, in his or her discretion, require a doctor's certificate or other
written evidence that such employee is eligible and qualified to receive sick
leave with pay hereunder. Sick leave may be taken in increments of no fewer
than fifteen (15) minutes.
(Ord. 2008-101. Passed 1-8-08.)
   (d)   After January 1, 1985, a full-time employee may not accumulate more
than a total of 960 hours of sick leave as a Village employee at the end of any
calendar year. For every forty (40) hours of sick leave earned as a Village
employee after January 1, 1985, in excess of 960 hours, ten (10) additional
vacation hours will be granted to such employee during the following calendar
year.
(Ord. 2009-102. Passed 3-10-09.)
   (e)   (1)   A full-time employee with ten (10) or more years of full-time
service to the Village, shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment of one
(1) hour’s pay for every four (4) hours of sick leave accumulated as a Village
employee, up to a maximum of 240 hours, at death or upon retirement if eligible
to receive retirement benefits under a State program or plan applicable to
full-time Village employees. If a full-time employee leaves Village employment
under any other circumstances, that employee shall not receive a lump sum
payment, but would be eligible to have his or her sick leave reinstated if that
employee is re-employed by the Village.
      (2)   With the Mayor’s approval, the employee may elect to receive Paid
Time Off in lieu of the aforementioned lump sum payment. The Paid Time Off
available to the employee shall be the number of days that would cost the
Village the same total dollar amount as if the employee had elected to receive
the lump sum payment, taking into account all directly related variable
employment costs (including but not limited to the Village’s pension
obligation). Paid Time Off shall be paid through regular payroll and shall
comply with the regulations of any applicable state retirement system. (Ord.
2014-105. Passed 3-11-14.)
   (f)   The unused balance of accumulated sick leave earned as a full-time
employee with another public agency in the State of Ohio may be transferred and
credited with the Village as and to the extent approved by Council at the time
of appointment to a full-time position, provided that the total amount of sick
leave transferred to the Village, beginning October 1, 2011, shall not exceed
nine hundred sixty (960) hours. "Public agency" as used herein includes
employment with the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions.
Transfer of sick leave will not be granted if the time between separation and
appointment exceeds ten (10) years, if prior service was not earned in a full-
time position or if a cash payment was received for sick leave upon separation.
Written verification of prior employment and any unused accumulated sick leave
balance claimed may be submitted at or prior to the time of commencing full-
time employment with the Village.
   Sick leave transfer credited shall not be added to the total sick leave
earned as a Village employee for purposes of cash out. Transferred sick leave
may only be used as sick leave after exhausting sick leave accumulated with the
Village.
   (g)   No person shall take more than nine hundred sixty (960) hours of sick
leave as paid time-off in any twelve month period. Hours earned or accumulated
in excess of nine hundred sixty (960) hours may be taken as time-off without
pay.
(Ord. 2011-130. Passed 9-13-11.)
   149.15 INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.
   (a)   Education Incentive Pay Plan.
      (1)   All full-time employees who are eligible for overtime compensation,
and who have completed one (1) year of full-time service with the Village, are
eligible to receive the following annual pay incentive:
 
Type of Education       Annual Pay Incentive
2-Year Associate Degree $1,000
4-Year College Degree   2,000
Masters Degree          2,500
      (2)   A single annual payment for education incentive shall be made in
the first July payroll as additional taxable compensation, based on the highest
degree achieved as of that date. Payments shall be made to those employees
employed as of July 1st. Payments will begin upon submission of proof of the
certificate or degree to the Finance Director, or his designee, for
qualification and approval prior to July 1st in the year in which payments
begin.
      (3)   Payments will be made during the calendar year in which the
certificate or degree is awarded and each calendar year thereafter while in the
full-time employ of the Village.
      (4)   Degrees eligible for the incentive must be granted by an accredited
degree granting institution of higher learning.
   (b)   Wellness Incentive Pay.
      (1)   All full-time and part-time employees who have completed six (6)
months of services with the Village are eligible to participate in the wellness
incentive pay plan. Both part-time and full-time non-tobacco user employees
must be in the active pay status in order to be eligible to receive payments
under this program. A part-time employee must have worked a minimum of eight
(8) hours per pay period in the previous six (6) months in order to be eligible
to participate in the wellness incentive pay plan.
      (2)   Payments for those eligible will generally be paid every six (6)
months, not to exceed two (2) payments in any calendar year. Payments will
begin after completion of the required approved fitness test and for those
qualifying under the program guidelines set up and approved by the Village.
Payment for full-time employees is made on the basis of two dollars ($2.00) per
point earned or granted as shown on the chart below.
 
RATING        RATING INTERVALS EVERY 6 MONTHS ACTIVE PAY
Excellent     $900.00 - $1,000
Good          $750.00 - $899.00
Above Average $600.00 - $749.00
Average       $450.00 - $599.00
Below Average $301.00 - $449.00
Poor          $0.00 - $300.00
Part-time employees shall receive a prorated payment on the basis of $2.00 per
point earned or granted as shown on the chart above multiplied by a factor that
equals the number of hours the part-time employee worked during the previous
calendar year divided by 2080 (e.g. for the year 2013, an employee who worked
520 hours in 2012 and qualifies as “Excellent” in 2013 would receive (520/2080)
x $1,000 = $250).
      (3)   Failure to take a test, or to follow the guidelines of the
Village’s appointed Counselor, and/or failure to improve when in the poor or
below average ratings, will result in ineligibility for six (6) months.
      (4)   To be eligible for payment under this plan, the employee must sign
an affidavit asserting that he or she has not smoked or otherwise used tobacco
products within the six month period just prior to the fitness test.
         (Ord. 2013-110. Passed 4-9-13.)
   (c)   (Reserved).
   (d)   Attendance Incentive Program.
      (1)   Purpose. To minimize disruption to the work schedule and minimize
the need for unscheduled overtime work.
      (2)   Incentives. The Attendance Incentive Program has two rewards, a
monetary incentive and a scheduled time off incentive.
         (Ord. 2008-101. Passed 1-8-08.)
      (3)   Eligibility. All full-time employees who are eligible for overtime
compensation and who have completed one (1) or more years of full-time,
uninterrupted, continuous service with the Village of Hunting Valley as of the
ending date of the Plan Year will be eligible for the Attendance Incentive
Program. In determining an employee’s eligibility, a deduction will be made for
any interruption in continuous service for any period greater than ten (10)
consecutive unpaid work days in the inactive pay status. The “Plan Year” is
defined as twenty-six consecutive pay periods with the twenty-sixth pay period
having an ending date closest to November 1st.
      (4)   Active Pay Status. Active pay status is defined to include hours
for which wages are paid by the Village for services provided, vacation hours,
holiday hours, sick leave, bereavement leave, or paid administrative leave.
      (5)   Inactive Pay Status.  Inactive pay status includes all periods when
an employee is not receiving wages for hours designated in the active pay
status. Injury leave where an employee receives payments from the Bureau of
Workers’ Compensation, or all other unpaid leave of absences are considered
inactive status for purposes of attendance incentive credit.
      (6)   Date of Payment.  Generally, employees will receive this payment in
a special pay period ending closest to December 15.
      (7)   Computation of Monetary Incentive. The amount of the payment will
be determined by multiplying the employee’s base monthly rate of pay in effect
on the ending date of the plan, by twelve (12) and multiplying the result of
that computation by a percentage as determined in the chart below, where
‘minimum hours’ and ‘maximum hours’ will mean the hours of sick time used
(whether paid or unpaid) by the employee, added to the hours that the employee
was on inactive pay status for the plan year. Time off granted because of this
incentive is subject to administrative rules of the Mayor.
(8)   Scheduled Time-off Incentives. The number of hours of scheduled time off
granted to the employee will be determined by the chart below.
Minimum Hours Maximum Hours Monetary   Scheduled Time-
                            Percentage Off (Hours)
0             0             3.5        20

   An officer or employee of the Village who is entitled to a leave of absence
with pay for military service under Ohio R.C. 5923.05, or any similar law,

difference between his or her regular Village compensation and the military pay
for the period of such service, not to exceed thirty-one days in any calendar
year.

immediate family. In the event of a death in such employee’s immediate family,
the employee may utilize up to 40 hours of bereavement leave if the deceased is
employee’s spouse, mother, father or child. Up to 30 hours bereavement leave
will be granted if the deceased is employee’s stepmother, stepfather,
stepchild, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-
in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or any other
person who is a member of such employee’s household as approved by the Village.
   (b)   Such days will be granted for days the employee would have normally
been scheduled to work from the date of death to the date of interment to
attend the services of the deceased. The Village may make exceptions based upon
special hardship cases, whereby additional time may be granted through use of
the employee’s accumulated vacation hours or holiday hours. Case-by-case
analysis will be the Village’s basis for the granting of this additional time.

TITLE NINE - Judiciary
Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Hunting Valley
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Hunting Valley ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Hunting Valley, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
the Mayor unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the Mayor. If the defendant, in such event,
does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the Mayor shall require
the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of record in
Cuyahoga County (the Shaker Heights Municipal Court) and the Mayor shall
thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings
and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of
record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides
that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to a jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
   The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by
Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not
made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to
a jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2946.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Hunting Valley ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does
not exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.

   313.01 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)    All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals are erected at all
intersections with such through highways, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and
no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation, that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes the stop sign under this subsection, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)    Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or highway, or
portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be a Municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on such street or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the Municipality
may, by ordinance, designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to
be a through street or highway, and thereafter the affected residence district
shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or more
through highways designated under this subsection intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authority, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(ORC 4511.65; Adopting Ordinance)
   (c)    The following streets are designated as through streets. All vehicles
shall stop before entering such streets unless otherwise directed by a traffic
control device or by a police officer: Cedar Road, County Line Road, Fairmount
Boulevard, Chagrin River Road, Shaker Boulevard, SOM Center Road and South
Woodland Road.
   (d)    The following streets are designated as stop streets, and all
vehicles thereon shall stop before entering the intersection of the second
listed street unless otherwise directed by a traffic control device or by a
police officer: County Line Road at Fairmount Boulevard, County Line Road at
South Woodland Road, Fairmount Boulevard at SOM Center Road, Falls Road at
South Woodland Road, Mather Lane at County Line Road, Old Kinsman Road at SOM
Center Road, Cedar Road at Chagrin River Road, Chagrin River Road at South
Woodland Road, Shaker Boulevard at Chagrin River Road.
(Ord. 1970-124. Passed 10-18-70.)
   (e)    Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way or merge with all traffic proceeding
on the through street or highway.
   (f)    Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.02  INTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED BY SIGNALS.
   The following intersections shall be controlled by a traffic control signal:
Fairmount Boulevard and Chagrin River Road, SOM Center Road and Cedar Road, SOM
Center Road and Fairmount Boulevard, and SOM Center Road and Shaker Boulevard.
(Ord. 1970-124. Passed 10-18-70.)
   313.03  RIGHT TURN ON RED PROHIBITED.
   (a)    A right turn against a steady red signal shall be prohibited at the
intersection of South Woodland Road westbound on to Chagrin River Road
northbound.
   (b)   There shall be posted at that intersection, in accordance with the

to a civil penalty if the motor vehicle is recorded by an A Traffic Law

         (Ord. 2025-3. Passed 1-14-25.)

Procedure, and Ohio Rules of Superintendence, as the Court deems appropriate.

extend the time period in which a hearing must be conducted upon its own
motion, or either a request for additional time or waiver of time limits by the
person or entity who requested the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided by the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. The Shaker Heights Municipal
Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes that
a Traffic Law Violation alleged in the Ticket did in fact occur and that the
person or entity requesting the hearing is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)    (1)    If the Shaker Heights Municipal Court finds that the person or
entity named in the Ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at
the time of the violation or receives evidence identifying a Designated Party,
the Court shall provide to Village or its designee, within five (5) days of the
hearing, a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the Designated
Party.
      (2)    Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the Designated Party,
Village or its designee may issue a Ticket to the Designated Party. The Village
shall ensure that a Ticket issued under this section conforms with this
Chapter. The Village or its designee shall send the Ticket by regular mail not
later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the evidence from the Court of
the identity of the Designated Party.
   
   (d)    If a Designated Party, who is issued a Ticket under this Chapter,
contests the Ticket by filing a written request for a hearing and does so not
later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Ticket, the Village shall
require the Registered Owner of the motor vehicle to also attend the hearing.
If at the hearing involving the Designated Party the Shaker Heights Municipal
Court cannot determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time
of the violation, the Registered Owner shall be liable for the violation. The
Shaker Heights Municipal Court shall then issue a decision imposing liability
for the violation on the Registered Owner and submit it to the Village or its
designee and to the Registered Owner. If the Designated Party, also is a
Registered Owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of Registered Owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (e)   The Shaker Heights Municipal Court shall determine whether a
preponderance of evidence establishes that a traffic law violation occurred and
the person requesting the hearing is the party operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation. The Shaker Heights Municipal Court may advise the person
or entity on the day of the hearing of its decision.
      (1)   If the Shaker Heights Municipal Court finds by a preponderance of
the evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that
the person or entity named in the notice of violation is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Court shall issue a
journal entry imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the Village of Hunting Valley or its designee and the
person or entity named in the notice of violation.
      (2)    If the Shaker Heights Municipal Court finds by a preponderance of
the evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in
fact occur but the person or entity named in the notice of violation is not the
person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Court
shall issue a journal entry finding that the individual or entity is not liable
for the violation and submit it to the Village of Hunting Valley or its
designee and the person or entity named in the notice of violation.
      (3)    If the person who requested the hearing or a representative of the
entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the Shaker
Heights Municipal Court shall determine that the person or entity is liable for
the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a journal entry
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the Village of Hunting Valley or its designee and the person or entity
named in the notice of violation.
   (f)    If the registered owner or designated party chooses to contest the
notice of violation, the Shaker Heights Municipal Court may consider any of the
following as an affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being
established by a preponderance of the evidence by the registered owner or
responsible party:
      (1)   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the
traffic law violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation, the owner must
submit proof that a police report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed prior to the traffic law violation or within forty-eight (48)
hours after the traffic law violation occurred.
      (2)    That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation.
      (3)    That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
      (4)   Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to Section
317.07 (e)(1), that the registered owner or person named in the notice of
violation was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. To
satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner or person named
in the notice of violation shall provide to the Shaker Heights Municipal Court
evidence showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle
at the time of the traffic law violation, including, but not limited to, the
operator's name and current address, and any other evidence the Shaker Heights
Municipal Court deems pertinent.
      (5)    That the motor vehicle operator was yielding the right-of-way to
an emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
      (6)    That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to yield
the right-of-way to either of the following: (i) a public safety vehicle or
coroner's vehicle in accordance with section 4511.45 of the Ohio Revised Code;
or (ii) a funeral procession in accordance with Section 4511.451 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (7)    At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
      (8)    That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of violation is not liable.
   (g)    If the Shaker Heights Municipal Court finds that the person or entity
named in the notice of violation was not operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the violation or receives evidence under Section
317.07(e)(4) identifying the designated party, the Shaker Heights Municipal
Court shall provide it to the Village of Hunting Valley or its designee within
five (5) calendar days, along with a copy of any evidence substantiating who
was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to this
Chapter or pursuant to Section 317.05, the Village of Hunting Valley or its
designee may issue a notice of violation, with the name and address of the
designated party and the information required by Section
317.04 of this Chapter, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
      (2)    A notice of violation issued under this Section
317.07(g), shall be sent by the Village of Hunting Valley or its designee by
ordinary mail no later than twenty-one (21) business days after the receipt of
the evidence from the Shaker Heights Municipal Court. The content of a notice
of violation issued under this subsection shall be the same as set forth in
subsection (a) of Section
317.04 of this Chapter.
      (3)    If a Designated Party who was issued a notice of violation under
Section
317.07(e) hereof contests the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the notice of violation not later than thirty
(30) days after receipt of the notice of violation, the Village of Hunting
Valley shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend
the hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the hearing
officer cannot determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The
hearing officer then shall issue a written decision imposing liability for the
violation on the registered owner and submit it to the local authority or its
designee and to the registered owner. If the designated party also is a
registered owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (h)    A person who is named in a notice of violation for a civil violation
may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with division (D) of Section
2317.02 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (i)    A person or entity found liable for a Ticket may appeal the decision
rendered by the Shaker Heights Municipal Court in accordance with Ohio law.
   (j)    No decision rendered under this Section, and no admission of
liability under this Chapter is admissible as evidence in any other judicial
proceeding in this state, except as is provided in Section
317.10 herein below.

   (a)    No person shall operate a motor vehicle at a speed greater or less
than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and
width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall
drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
(A.O.)
   (b)    It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared by
the Ohio Director of Transportation or local authority, pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4511.21 or subsections (e) through (g) hereof, for the operator of a motor
vehicle to operate the same at a speed not exceeding the following:
(Ord. 2008-117. Passed 9-9-08.)
      (1)    A.    Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess
and while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected. The
end of every school zone may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the
zone. Nothing in this section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform
System of Traffic Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to
be indicated by signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other
special notice of the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.    As used in this section, "school" means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Ohio Department of Education, in compliance with Rule 3301-
35-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's report for the
parents of the school's pupils certifying that the school meets Ohio minimum
standards for nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of
this filing to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment
of a school zone.
         C.    As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway, and also includes that portion of a State highway. Upon request from
local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Ohio Director of
Transportation, the Director may extend the traditional school zone boundaries.
The distances in paragraphs (b)(2)C.1. and 2. hereof shall not exceed 300 feet
per approach per direction and are bounded by whichever of the following
distances or combinations thereof the Director approves as most appropriate:
1.    The distance encompassed by projecting the school building lines normal
to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on each approach
direction;
2.    The distance encompassed by projecting the school property lines
intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on each
approach direction; or
3.    The distance encompassed by the special marking of the pavement for a
principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on each approach
direction of the highway.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial
action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional
school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in this paragraph.
(2)    Thirty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the Municipality,
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) hereof; (A.O.)
(3)    Forty miles per hour on State Route 87 (South Woodland Road), for that
portion of the road which is east of its intersection with Chagrin River Road,
and on State Route 91 (SOM Center Road).
(4)   Forty-five miles per hour on State Route 87 (South Woodland Road) for
that portion of the road which is west of its intersection with Chagrin River
Road.
(Ord. 2008-117. Passed 9-9-08.)
   (c)    It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) hereof or any declared pursuant
to subsections (e) through (g) hereof or Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director
of Transportation or local authority. No person shall be convicted of more than
one violation of this section for the same conduct, although violations of more
than one provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a
single affidavit.
   (d)    In every charge of violation of this section, the affidavit and
warrant shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven, and, in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c)
hereof, the speed which is prima-facie lawful at the time and place of such
alleged violation, as the same is set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3)
hereof or declared pursuant to subsections (h) through (j) hereof or Ohio R.C.
4511.21, except that in affidavits where a person is alleged to have driven at
a greater speed than will permit the person to bring the vehicle to a stop
within the assured clear distance ahead the affidavit and warrant need not
specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven.
   (e)    Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, upon the
basis of a geometric and traffic characteristic study, that any speed limit set
forth in subsections (b) through (d) hereof is greater than is reasonable or
safe under the conditions found to exist at any portion of a street or highway
under the jurisdiction of the Director, the Director shall determine and
declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit, which shall be effective
when appropriate signs giving notice of it are erected at the location.
   (f)    Whenever Council determines, upon the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation, that the speed permitted by subsections (b) and (c)
hereof, on any part of a highway under its jurisdiction, is greater than is
reasonable and safe under the conditions found to exist at such location,
Council may, by resolution, request the Director to determine and declare a
reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit. Upon receipt of such request, the
Director may determine and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed
limit at such location, and if the Director does so, then such declared speed
limit shall become effective only when appropriate signs giving notice thereof
are erected at such location by the Municipality. The Director may withdraw his
or her declaration of any prima-facie speed limit whenever in his or her
opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon such
withdrawal, the declared prima-facie speed shall become ineffective and the
signs relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the Municipality.
   (g)    Council may authorize by ordinance higher prima-facie speeds than
those stated in this section upon through highways, or upon highways or
portions thereof where there are no intersections, or between widely spaced
intersections, provided that signs are erected giving notice of the authorized
speed, but Council shall not modify or alter the basic rule set forth in
subsection (a) hereof or in any event authorize by ordinance a speed in excess
of fifty miles per hour.
   Alteration of prima-facie limits on State routes by Council shall not be
effective until the alteration has been approved by the Director. The Director
may withdraw approval of any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in the
Director's opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon
such withdrawal, the altered prima-facie speed shall become ineffective and the
signs relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the Municipality.
331.03  FULL TIME AND ATTENTION.
   (a)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle or motorcycle in and upon the
streets and highways of the Municipality unless he shall give and devote his
full time and attention to the operation of such motor vehicle or motorcycle.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

of the definition of the term "person" that is set forth in paragraph (b)
(1)A.2. hereof be applied or construed in any section contained in this General
Offenses Code that sets forth a criminal offense in any of the following
manners:

2.    Her causing, in any other manner, the death in utero of a viable, unborn
human that she is carrying;
3.    Her causing the death of her child who is born alive, but who dies from

   501.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)    A person acts purposely when it is his or her specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his or her specific intention to engage in conduct of
that nature.
   (b)    A person acts knowingly, regardless of his or her purpose, when he or
she is aware that his or her conduct will probably cause a certain result or
will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances
when he or she is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   (c)    A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he or she perversely disregards a known risk that his or her
conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain
nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless
indifference to the consequences, he or she perversely disregards a known risk
that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)    A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he or she fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his or her conduct
may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent
with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due
care, he or she fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may
exist.
   (e)    When the section defining an offense provides that negligence
suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or
purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness
suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability
for such element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.03 OFFENSES DEFINED.
   (a)    No conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the Municipality
unless it is defined as an offense in this General Offenses Code or in any
other ordinance or resolution, rule or regulation of the Municipality.
   (b)    An offense is defined when one or more sections of this General
Offenses Code state a positive prohibition or enjoin a specific duty, and
provide a penalty for violation of such prohibition or failure to meet such
duty.
   (c)    This section does not affect the power of a court to punish for
contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law to enforce an order, civil
judgment or decree.
(ORC 2901.03)
   501.04  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. 
   (a)    Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty
of an offense unless both of the following apply:
(1)    His or her liability is based on conduct which includes either a
voluntary act or an omission to perform an act or duty which he or she is
capable of performing;
(2)    He or she has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to
which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.
   (b)    When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability
for the conduct described in such section, then culpability is not required for
a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies
culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability,
recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (c)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (d)    As used in this section:
(1)    Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of his or her control thereof for a
sufficient time to have ended his or her possession.
(2)    Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep
and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition are
involuntary acts.
(3)    "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in Section 501.02, or any other specific mental state required by any
section of this General Offenses Code.
(4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

volume louder than is necessary for convenient hearing for the person or
persons who are in the room, vehicle or chamber in which the device is operated
and who are voluntary listeners. The operation of any of the above-named
devices between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or in such a manner that
the noise is plainly audible at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the source
of the noise will be prima facie evidence of a violation;
      (3)   The keeping of any animal or bird which, by causing frequent or
long continued noise, disturbs the comfort or repose of any person in the
vicinity, where such noise can be distinctly heard outside the property line of

steam engine, stationary internal combustion engine, motor vehicle or motor
boat engine;
      (7)   The creation of a loud and excessive noise in connection with the

boxes, crates, and containers;

operation of any instrument, device, agency or vehicle, the performance of any
construction, demolition or agricultural activity or the operation of any
mechanical, electrical, pneumatically, hydraulically powered or battery
operated apparatus used in connection with any construction, demolition or

from Monday to Saturday, inclusive.
      (10)   The creation of any excessive noise on any street adjacent to any
school, institution of learning, or church which unreasonably interferes with
the operation of such school, institution of learning, or church.
   (c)   None of the prohibitions set forth in subsections (a) and (b) shall
apply to the following:
      (1)   Any police vehicle, ambulance, fire engine or emergency vehicle
while engaged in necessary emergency activities;

degree for a first offense and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each
offense thereafter.

intended to be used, and hours of operation.
(b)    A plan of the proposed site showing dimensions of the entire usable
areas, dimensions of actual landing and take-off areas, all obstructions within

chapter, as well as all other Village ordinances, will be complied with, that
the public safety will be protected, and that the use and enjoyment of
neighboring property will not be adversely affected.
   (b)    Every such approval shall be subject to:

possible, the privacy of any resident of the Village of Hunting Valley who has
advised the Village that the resident does not wish to be visited by any person

   1113.01  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS. 
   (a)    Council finds that the Village contains lands which have unique
scenic, ecological, recreational and scientific value which qualities benefit
not only the residents of the Village but also the entire metropolitan area of
the County.
   (b)    Council also finds, based on studies and investigations conducted by
the Open Space Commission, on its review of the Open Space Study, and on its
own knowledge, that a significant portion of the lands in the Village is
comprised of exceedingly steep slopes, is located in flood plains and has
unique forest and terrain characteristics.
   (c)    Council also finds that it is a necessary public purpose to acquire
land and incorporeal rights or interests in land, including conservation
easements, in order to conserve and retain certain areas within the Village
predominantly in their natural, scenic, open or wooded condition, which
acquisition will not only result in the preservation of natural beauty and
terrain, but also in many instances will, by restricting or limiting
development, protect the public health and safety by preventing the erosion of
soils, the contamination of water supplies, the increased run-off of surface
water and the increased risk of flood damage.
   (d)    Council also finds, upon its review of the Open Space Study, that the
areas in the Village at which this acquisition activity should primarily be
directed are the Chagrin Valley Floor (being Zones A1, A1-B.F. and A2 in that
Study); the Chagrin Valley Walls (being Zone B1 in that Study); and the Chagrin
River Tributaries (being Zone B2 in that Study).
(Ord. 1989-107. Passed 4-11-89.)
   1113.02 ADOPTION OF MASTER PLAN.
   The Open Space Study and accompanying Open Space Map presently on file with
the Village Clerk is hereby adopted as the Official Master Plan of the Village,
to be followed in pursuing the public purpose of conserving and retaining
certain areas within the Village predominantly in their natural, scenic, open
or wooded condition, which Master Plan is hereby incorporated herein and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 1989-107. Passed 4-11-89.)
   1113.03 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   It is intended that the provisions of this chapter and the Master Plan shall
be applied to acquire land, or incorporeal interests in land, including
conservation easements, for the public purpose of conserving and retaining such
areas predominantly in their natural, scenic, open or wooded condition, which
acquisition should also achieve some or all of the following objectives:
(a)    Protection of the scenic values and the scenic resources of the Village,
particularly the natural beauty and terrain of the Village, the foremost of
which is the Chagrin River Valley, including the tributaries thereto, together
with the preservation of biological and ecological diversity;
(b)    Preservation of open space for the general welfare of the residents of
the Village, including recreational, environmental and other purposes; and
(c)    Protection of the public health and safety by preventing the
contamination of water supplies, the erosion of soils, the increased run-off of
surface water and the increased risk of flood damage.
      (Ord. 1989-107. Passed 4-11-89.)
   1113.04 CRITERIA TO BE USED IN ACQUISITION PROGRAM.
   (a)    Council is committed to a program for the acquisition of land, or
incorporeal rights or interests in land, including conservation easements as
prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5301.67 through 5301.70, in order to accomplish the
public purpose and objectives set forth in Section
1113.03. That acquisition may take several forms, including, but not limited
to, the purchase of land to be held by the Village in fee, or the purchase of
land for the purpose of applying restrictive covenants or conservation
easements to such land and then reselling such land, or the purchase of
conservation easements as defined in Ohio R.C. 5301.67, or the acceptance of a
donation of such lands or conservation easements, all in such manner as Council
may at such time in each case determine.
   (b)    Council, either acting on its own volition, or upon the advice and
recommendation of the Open Space Commission, or upon the advice and
recommendation of any committee appointed by it, may make such acquisitions as
it deems desirable in order to accomplish the aforesaid objectives. In deciding
whether or not to enter into such acquisition the following factors shall be
taken into account:
(1)    Whether the property is located in the Zones mentioned in Section
1113.02(d) and as identified on the Master Plan, or, if such property is not
within such Zones, whether such property is determined to have unique flora,
fauna, ecological or scenic values which should be preserved;
(2)    Whether the acquisition of the property will achieve some or all of the
objectives set forth in Section
1113.03 and, if so, which of those objectives will be met by such acquisition;
(3)    Whether the acquisition will be by purchase, and, if so, the estimated
cost of such purchase, and if such purchase is of land which would be resold
after having appropriate restrictive covenants or conservation easements
applied thereto, the estimated price at which such land could be resold;
(4)    Whether the property is being marketed or is planned to be marketed by
the owner thereof with a view to increasing development on the property and
thereby significantly altering the natural state of the property in a manner
contrary to the Master Plan and the objectives stated in Section
1113.03;
(5)    Whether efforts have been made to persuade the owner to donate the
property or conservation easements thereon to the Chagrin River Land
Conservancy, or a nonprofit organization whose purpose is the conservation and
retention of property in the Village in its natural, scenic, open or wooded
condition; and
(6)    Such other factors as Council may deem to be relevant and appropriate to
consider at such time for each particular acquisition.
   (c)    Each such acquisition shall be held in the name of the Village and
administered so as to achieve the purposes of this chapter by the Open Space
Commission, any committee, officer or department appointed by Council, or, if
appropriate agreements are entered into between the Village and such
organizations, by the Chagrin River Land Conservancy or a nonprofit
organization whose purpose is the conservation and retention of property in the
Village in its natural, scenic, open or wooded condition. Council shall
determine the appropriate body to administer each acquisition as it is made and
shall so indicate in legislation determining to proceed with such acquisition,
provided, however, that Council may at any time redesignate the appropriate
body to administer such acquisition so as to achieve the purposes of this
chapter.

   1131.01 TITLE.
   This Title Three, Subdivision Regulations, of the Planning and Zoning Code,
providing for the establishment of regulations, rules and standards for
subdividing and developing land within the Village, including procedures for
administration and penalties for the violation thereof, shall be known, cited
and referred to as the "Subdivision and Land Development Regulations" for the
Village of Hunting Valley, or just "these Regulations."
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1131.02 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   (a)    The Council of the Village of Hunting Valley finds that the Village
contains lands which have unique scenic, residential, recreational and
scientific value, which qualities benefit not only the residents of the Village
but also the entire metropolitan area of Cuyahoga County.
   (b)    The Council also finds, based on studies and investigations conducted
by its Open Space Committee and on a report prepared by the land use planning
consultant retained by that Committee and on its own knowledge, that a
significant portion of the lands in the Village is comprised of exceedingly
steep slopes, is located in flood plains, contains soils which are unsuitable
for septic systems, and lacks a dependable supply of well water. Certain of
these conditions are indicated on a map of the Village prepared by William
Behnke Associates.
   (c)    The Council finds it necessary to regulate the subdivision of land
and the splitting of lots in order to preserve and protect not only the public
interest in the preservation of natural beauty and terrain but, even more
importantly, to protect the public health and safety by preventing the erosion
of soils, the contamination of water supplies, the increased runoff of surface
water and the increased risk of flood damage.
   (d)    The Council also finds that in order to protect the ultimate
purchasers of lots in the Village, who thereby become future residents and
taxpayers thereof, that the planning process must take steps to ensure that
each newly created lot from this date forward contains a suitable building site
with reasonable access, a reasonable grade, an available supply of water and an
adequate field for the placement of a properly designed septic system, and,
further, is designed in a way to minimize the amount of surface water runoff
from the lot so as to prevent soil erosion and flooding.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1131.03  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The general purpose of these Regulations shall be to guide and regulate the
subdivision and development of land in order to promote and protect the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare. It is
intended that the provisions of these Regulations shall be applied to achieve
the following objectives:
(a)    Protection of the public health and safety by preventing the
contamination of water supplies, the erosion of soils, the increased runoff of
surface water and the increased risk of flood damage;
(b)    Protection of the scenic values and the scenic resources of the Village,
particularly the natural beauty and terrain of the Village, the foremost of
which is the Chagrin River Valley, together with the preservation of biological
and ecological diversity;
(c)    Preservation of open space for the general welfare of the residents of
the Village, including recreational, environmental and other purposes;
(d)    Orderly development of the land;
(e)    Provide that each newly created lot not only meets the five-acre minimum
size requirement contained in the Zoning Code and Zoning Map of the Village,
but also contains a suitable building site which conforms to the setback
requirements of the Zoning Code, has reasonable access, a reasonable grade, an
available supply of water and an adequate field for the placement of a properly
designed septic system, and is designed in a way to minimize the amount of
surface water runoff from the lot so as to prevent soil erosion and flooding;
and
(f)    Ensure the accurate surveying of land and the proper preparation and
recording of plats.
      (Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1131.04 INTERPRETATION; AUTHORITY.
   These Subdivision and Land Development Regulations shall be considered
minimum requirements for the protection of the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare, pursuant to the authority
of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, the Charter of the Village and the
platting and land subdivision statutes of the State (Ohio R.C. Chapter 711) or
such statutes as are hereafter in effect.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1131.05 AMENDMENTS.
   Amendments to these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations may be
initiated by either the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the Council. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on all proposed
amendments, whether initiated by the Planning and Zoning Commission or referred
to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the Council. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall promptly, after such hearing, make a report to Council on the
proposed amendment, which report shall summarize the results of the public
hearing, the effect of the amendment, especially as it relates to the findings
and objectives set forth in Sections
1131.02 and
1131.03, and which report shall contain the recommendation of the Planning and
Zoning Commission as to whether or not such amendment should be approved by
Council. The Council shall consider such report and may pass any ordinance
providing for such amendment only upon the affirmative vote of at least four
members of Council.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1131.06 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of these Subdivision
and Land Development Regulations is for any reason held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the remaining
portion of these Regulations.

   1133.01 VARIANCES.
   Where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that the land involved in a
subdivision is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitations,
or is affected by such topographical conditions, or is to be devoted to such
usage, that it is impossible or impracticable in the particular proposal for
the developer to conform fully to a mandatory provision of these Subdivision
and Land Development Regulations, the Planning and Zoning Commission may grant
a variance from such mandatory provision as may be reasonable, provided,
however, that no such variance shall be granted which impairs the purposes and
objectives of these Regulations as set forth in Section
1131.03.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1133.02 APPEALS.
   A developer aggrieved by any final action of the Council in regard to
refusal to approve a subdivision may appeal such decision pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1133.03 SCHEDULE OF FEES AND DEPOSITS.
   (a)    Plan and Plat Approval. At the time of filing the application for
approval of any plat or development plan, and at the time when plans and
specifications for any improvements are submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for approval, there shall be paid to the Finance Director a filing
fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per lot and a deposit of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) per application, to secure the payment by the applicant of all
expenses incurred by the Village in the processing of the application and all
pertinent papers connected therewith.
   The cost and expense of any investigations by the Village Engineer, the
Director of Law and other Village officials, to determine whether such proposed
subdivision or development plan is in accordance with law, and whether its
improvements, if any, have been made or are being made in accordance with the
requirements of the Village, the cost of any and all notices required, and all
other necessary expenses, shall be paid from the deposit.
   In the event that the actual expenditures exceed such deposit, the excess
shall be paid by the applicant upon demand. If such expenditures are less than
the required deposit, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant upon the
completion of all administrative proceedings involved in connection with the
plat. No filing fee shall be refunded or returned. No building permits shall be
issued until any additional amount required to be paid by the applicant has
been deposited.
   (b)    Recording Expenses. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to
improve or develop land in the Village shall prepare, execute and deliver to
the Building Inspector the documents necessary to carry out the improvements as
required by the rules, regulations and ordinances of the Village, at the cost

pay a sum of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000) for each lot or parcel of land sold, in an amount to
be determined by the Finance Director. The description of such lot or parcel by
metes and bounds in the deed of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller
from the forfeiture herein provided. The Village may enjoin such sale or
agreement by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   The sale of lots or parcels from a plat of a subdivision on which any and
all areas indicated as streets or as open ground are expressly indicated as for
the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such subdivision, and not
as public streets, ways or grounds, shall not serve to exempt the seller from
these requirements or from the forfeitures herein provided.
   1133.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of these
Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, or with any order issued pursuant
thereto, shall, for each and every violation or noncompliance, be fined not

   1135.01 TOPOGRAPHY. 
   (a)    Generally. Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the
topography of the land in order to utilize the natural contours and economize
in the construction of drainage facilities, reduce the amount of grading and
minimize destruction of trees and topsoil. Topographic maps shall be utilized
in this land planning.
   (b)    Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat or of very
gentle slopes should be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage
courses, and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade. On more
irregular topography, streets should be designed to avoid extensive cuts and
fills and to follow the ridges, or planned approximately parallel to contour
lines, adjusted, however, so that lots on one side of the street will not be
excessively below the street grade.
   (c)    Natural Drainage. Subdivisions should be designed, particularly on
land of very gentle slopes, to take every advantage of natural grades so that
all the land can be drained without excessive grading. Unless watercourses or
drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines
are approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only
where such a plan is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an
open drainage course. Easements for drainage ways and low-lying land which is
subject to flooding may not be included in calculating the required lot area or
width.
   (d)   Natural Features. Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, lakes, hilltops and other focal points within the site, and distant
views outside the subdivision, shall be integrated in the design to obtain
natural variations and interest and more attractive building sites. Trees,
topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved and utilized in the
planning and development of the subdivision.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1135.02 STREET PLANNING.
   In addition to relating streets to topography as recommended in Section
1135.01, streets should be designed according to the function served, the use
of abutting land and standards of width, intersections, maximum grades and
curvatures, as set forth in the following subsections.
(a)   Major streets function primarily for the movement of fast traffic between
points of heavy traffic generation. Where a subdivision adjoins a major street,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall require a plan wherein access drives
do not cut onto a major street, in order to protect the residential property
from the movement of heavy traffic, to avoid traffic congestion and to minimize
hazards to traffic. Such a plan shall provide for access drives to only cut
onto a local street or streets.
(b)    Local streets shall allow for access to each lot. The layout shall be
related to the topography and natural features. The street pattern shall be
indirect and yet continuous and formed of straight, moderately curved, loop,
angular or ell streets. There shall be an underlying systematic pattern, but
gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns shall be avoided. The street
pattern shall limit the number of local streets intersecting with a major
street in order to protect the residential property from the movement of heavy
traffic and to minimize hazards to the traffic on the major street.
(c)    Right-of-way widths shall not be less than the following:
(1)    Nonthrough streets, less than 1,500 feet in length: fifty-foot right of
way.
(2)    Through streets or nonthrough streets longer than 1,500 feet, and where
extra width is necessary for grading or placement of utilities: sixty-foot
right of way.
(3)    Cul-de-sac, less than 500 feet in length: fifty-foot right of way; more
than 500 feet in length: sixty-foot right of way. Turnaround, pavement outside
diameter: ninety feet; property line diameter: 130 feet; or such larger
diameters as may be required by the Village Engineer based upon the proposed
usage.
(d)    Grades of streets in vertical alignment shall not exceed ten percent.
Street grades shall be not less than one-half percent in order to provide
adequate surface drainage. The rate of change of grade shall not exceed four
percent per 100 feet.
(e)    Street names shall be selected which will not duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets in Cuyahoga County or Geauga County
irrespective of modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. Streets
that are or will eventually be continuations of existing or platted streets
shall be named the same as such streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1135.03  LOT DESIGN.
   Each lot should form a good site for the type of building to be developed
and the lot lines should not be considered as merely forming a geometric shape
which encloses the area permitted. The layout of the lots should be related to
the topography and natural features and in an irregular form so long as such
allows for a building site in conformity with the setback requirements of the
Zoning Code. Triangular lots and lots with acute angles, broken boundaries or
other shapes that restrict the use of the lot as a building site should be
avoided. The area of a lot shall be not less than five (5) acres as required by
the Zoning Code of the Village.
(Ord. 2021-9. Passed 9-14-21.)
   1135.04 EVIDENCE OF SUITABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A LOT.
   (a)    At the time of submitting an application for approval of a
preliminary plan under Section
1137.02, the developer shall furnish satisfactory evidence that for each lot to
be created pursuant to such plan, each such lot:
(1)    Has an adequate supply of water available either from a public water
line which borders one of the boundaries of the proposed subdivision or from an
individual water well which will produce safe, potable drinking water at a rate
of not less than three gallons per minute. Copies of well logs which are
obtained shall include the name and address of the well driller and shall be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(2)    Has available, based on the criteria of suitability of the soil
characteristics, surface drainage, topography and character of development, an
area for the installation of an individual septic tank disposal system, which
is feasible, conforms to the requirements of the Village, the appropriate
County Board of Health, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, does not
empty in any manner into open ditches, roadside ditches, lakes, streams or any
other body of water, and does not permit effluent to seep to the surface of the
ground. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain or perform
all tests in accordance with the requirements of the aforesaid public bodies. A
copy of the results of such tests shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
(3)    Has at least one suitable building site for a main building and at least
one accessory building, such as a garage, which building site meets the setback
requirements of the Zoning Code and may be cleared and prepared for building
with a minimal amount of disturbance to the natural grade, trees and
vegetation. Such building site shall be indicated on the map of each lot.
(4)    Has a suitable site for an access drive to serve such lot, which site
will be situated in such a way that it shall be of a less than ten percent
grade, shall follow the natural contours of the land as closely as possible and
minimize the amount of disturbance to the natural grade, trees and vegetation,
and shall meet the traffic safety concerns set forth in Chapter
1321 of these Codified Ordinances.
(5)    Has an adequate system of drainage so that significant erosion does not
occur and so that the storm water runoff is channeled in such a way as to
minimize the erosion of other property and to prevent the accumulation of
standing water on the lot or on any other property in the Village.
(6)    Has a significant amount of property which will be left in its natural
state. A map shall indicate the location of each tree on the lot over twenty
inches in diameter, which trees will be removed in order to allow for the
improvements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) hereof. Any plan for
replanting of trees removed and the reseeding of any grounds disturbed shall
also be furnished.
   (b)    Based on the findings of Council set forth in Section
1131.02 and specifically the report of the planning consultant discussed
therein, there is hereby established a presumption that any lot over nine acres
in size will normally be able to meet the criteria set forth in subsection (a)
hereof. Therefore, in connection with an application for the approval of a
preliminary plan, a developer may, at his or her option and solely in
connection with any lot to be created which is over nine acres in size, avoid
furnishing evidence for the purpose of these Regulations that as to such lot
the requirements set forth in subsection (a) hereof are satisfied, provided,
however, that nothing in this subsection shall relieve a developer or an owner
from complying with the applicable provisions of the Building Code of the
Village.

   1137.01 PRE-APPLICATION.
   The Village shall make available to developers copies of these Subdivision
and Land Development Regulations, the Zoning Code, the Zoning Map and other
adopted plans, street maps and information which may affect the development of
the property under consideration. Applications for approval of a subdivision
shall be in accordance with these Regulations and other codes and plans as
adopted and information furnished.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1137.02  PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)    Application. A written application for approval and three black-on-
white prints of a preliminary plan and profiles of all streets, plotted on a
topographic map, complying with the technical requirements set forth in Section
1143.02 and the planning principles established in Chapter
1135, shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for each
proposed subdivision. The purposes of the preliminary plan are to explore the
best design for the subdivision and the best relationship to adjoining
subdivisions or undeveloped land, to outline a program of improvements, to
ensure that an adequate water supply and an adequate septic system may be
provided to each lot and that extensive and environmentally harmful grading
operations will not be required, and to obtain the advice, suggestions and
requirements of the Planning and Zoning Commission before the plan becomes
rigid as in a detailed drawing. The submittal of alternative plans is
recommended.
   (b)    Planning and Zoning Commission Action. 
(1)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall examine the preliminary plan at
its next regular meeting, giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard and
to explain any questions concerning the plan.
(2)    The Building Inspector shall forward a print of the preliminary plan and
profiles to the Village Engineer who will check the same against the
requirements of these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations and of the
other applicable ordinances of the Village. The Village Engineer shall promptly
return a copy of the print and profiles to the Building Inspector, together
with his or her comments and recommendations.
         (Ord. 1992-127. Passed 12-15-92.)
(3)    After the Building Inspector receives the report of the Village Engineer
and any other comments and recommendations concerning the plan, and the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant are prepared to proceed, there
shall be a final public hearing on the plan. Notice of the hearing shall be
mailed to the applicant and owner of the land and to all abutting property
owners not less than ten days prior to the hearing, excluding the day of
mailing and including the day of the hearing, so that all interested parties
may attend the meeting.
         (Ord. 1996-120. Passed 10-8-96.)
(4)    For all subdivisions which are of such scope or at such locations as may
involve topographic, unstable soil conditions, unique ecological and
environmental concerns, or other unusual conditions, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may request authorization for an analysis and recommendation by a
professional land planner, civil engineer or landscape architect who is
experienced in planning the type of subdivision under consideration, and who
has no interest in the proposed subdivision. If the request is approved and
such professional advice is obtained, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
review the aforesaid analysis and recommendations and determine if the
preliminary plan embraces all the applicable planning principles and other
provisions of these Regulations, as well as other ordinances of the Village, at
a meeting or meetings prior to setting a date for a final hearing on the
preliminary plan.
(5)    If the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that the plan meets the
requirements of these Regulations and other ordinances of the Village, under
the circumstances, and it is approved, the Chairperson shall sign two copies of
the preliminary plan and profiles with a notation that the same are approved,
subject to any special conditions. One copy shall be delivered to Council and
the other shall be retained by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(6)    If the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve the plan and
profiles, it shall state in writing the conditions to be complied with before
approval may be obtained.
   (c)    Council Action. 
(1)    Whether the vote of the Planning and Zoning Commission is to approve or
disapprove the preliminary plan and profiles, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall deliver a copy of the plan and profiles to Council with a
written report of its action.
(2)    After receiving the report of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
Council shall vote to affirm or disaffirm the decision and action of the
Planning and Zoning Commission by majority vote.
   (d)    Effect of Approval. Final approval of the preliminary plan and
profiles shall assure the developer for a one-year period from the date of
approval by Council:
(1)    That the general layout of streets, lots, building sites and other
features is approved and has been established as the basis for the preparation
of the final plat;
(2)    That the general terms and any special conditions under which the
approval of the plan was granted will not be changed unless additional
information or data are received in the meantime that would indicate that
changes should be effected; and
(3)    That the developer may submit drawings and specifications for
improvements and a final plat for the subdivision.
   1137.03 FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Application. An application for approval of a final plat shall be
submitted in writing to the Building Inspector. The application shall include
the original tracing of the final plat, the original tracing of the drawings
for the required improvements, three black-on-white prints of each tracing,
three sets of specifications and profiles, and other maps, data and
certificates as set forth in Section
1143.03. 
   The developer may obtain conditional approval of the plat and install the
required improvements before applying for approval of the final plat, or,
alternatively, he or she may apply for approval of the final plat and drawings
and specifications of required improvements concurrently and furnish
performance guarantees that he or she will install the improvements thereafter.
   (b)    Review by Village Engineer. The Building Inspector shall transmit
three prints of each drawing and the specifications to the Village Engineer for
determination of whether or not:
(1)    The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plans and any
special conditions or modifications stipulated, and mathematical data and
computations are correct; and
(2)    The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on the
drawings and profiles and specifications are in conformance with the
construction standards in effect in the Village.
   One copy of each set of prints and specifications shall be returned to
Council by its next regular meeting indicating the Village Engineer's
determinations.
   (c)    Council Action on Final Plat. If the Village Engineer finds that the
final plat, drawings, profiles and specifications are satisfactory in regard to
the aforesaid provisions, and if the subdivision complies with all other
applicable provisions of these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations,
Council shall approve it. Action shall be taken within sixty days after the
meeting at which the application for approval and all required plats, maps and
data were submitted to Council or within a mutually agreed upon extension.
   Council shall act upon the final plat, drawings, profiles and specifications
either separately or concurrently, but in no event shall it approve the final
plat for recording until the improvements are constructed or their construction
has been satisfactorily guaranteed.
   (d)    Form of Approval. The approval of the final plat shall be noted on
the original tracing of the plat with the signature of the Village Clerk and
the Village Engineer. Such approval shall indicate the number of the resolution
approving the final plat and the date of passage. The Village shall retain a
duplicate tracing thereof at the developer's expense. The signed original
tracing of the plat shall be returned to the developer. The approval of the
drawing, profiles and specifications for the required improvements shall be
indicated by a certificate to that effect on the original drawings and
specifications over the signature of the Village Engineer. Approval of the
improvements as constructed shall likewise be certified by the Village
Engineer.
   (e)    Recording. The Village Engineer or the developer shall file the
signed original tracing of the approved final plat in the office of the County
Recorder. Approval by the Village shall expire on the sixtieth day following
final action by Council, unless within that period the plat shall have been
duly filed and recorded and the Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission
are provided with the recording data by the developer. If the final plat is
revised in any manner after approval, the approval shall be null and void.
   (f)    Effect of Approval and Recording. If drawings, profiles and
specifications for improvements are approved, the construction of the same may
be started. After satisfactory construction the final plat may be approved and
recorded, building permits may be issued, and lots may be sold, leased or
transferred. If drawings and specifications for improvements are approved and
their construction satisfactorily guaranteed, the final plat may be approved
for record purposes only and recorded, construction of improvements may be
started, building permits may be issued, and lots may be sold, leased or
transferred.
   1137.04  LANDS FOR PUBLIC USE; OTHER DEVELOPMENTS; TITLE INSURANCE.
   (a)    Dedication for Public Use. If the final plat indicates land for
public use, Council shall also act upon the acceptance of dedication of any
public land and acceptance of any easement before it is recorded. The
acceptance of any street for public use and maintenance shall be by separate
action of Council, and shall not be taken until all improvements required under
Chapter 1139 have been constructed to the full satisfaction of Council and the
Village Engineer.
   As soon as all improvements have been so constructed, the owner shall file
with the Director of Law a certificate of title insurance in the amount of at
least one thousand dollars ($1,000), meeting with the approval of the Director
of Law, showing that title to the street, streets or other public land in the
subdivision is good in the Village for the appropriate purposes and uses, which
title is to be free and clear from all encumbrances whatsoever. Council may
then, but shall not be required to, approve the plat for dedicating the street
areas and accept the streets as public highways, and its acceptance shall be
endorsed on the record plat and such plat shall then be recorded or rerecorded
by the Village Engineer in the office of the County Recorder. If Council does
not accept the dedication, it shall be noted on the record plat that the street
or streets within the subdivision have not been accepted for public use, and
maintenance thereof by the Village is not required, and such plat shall then be
recorded or rerecorded by the Village Engineer in the office of the County
Recorder.
   (b)    Land Reserved for Public Use. The Planning and Zoning Commission,
with the concurrence of Council, may request, by resolution, that a developer
set aside, reserve or offer for sale, land for streets, parks, wildlife refuges
or other public uses. For a period of ninety days after the receipt of a
complete application for approval of a preliminary plan (or for such longer
period as may be mutually agreed upon), the Village may seek to acquire such
land. During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees or topsoil
shall be removed or vegetation destroyed, no grading shall be done, and no land
so reserved shall be put to any use whatsoever, except with the prior written
approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (c)    Other Developments. An application and preliminary plan shall be
submitted by the developer to the Planning and Zoning Commission for all
proposals for other developments or subdivisions involving open space for
common use. All procedures, maps, plans, profiles and other data required by
Chapter
1143 with respect to preliminary plans, as set forth in Section
1143.02, shall be complied with and furnished, if determined to be applicable
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Where streets or other areas are to be
used by the public, all procedures, maps and other data required by Chapter
1143 for final plats as set forth in Section
1143.03 shall be complied with and furnished, if determined to be applicable by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   1137.05 RESUBDIVIDING, REPLATTING OR VACATION.
   An application for resubdividing, replatting or vacation of a subdivision
shall be made by the owner or owners thereof to the Planning and Zoning
Commission in the same form as for an original subdivision. The original lots
shall be shown by dotted lines, and lot numbers and other references shall be
made to the previously recorded subdivision.

   1139.01 INSTALLATION BEFORE FINAL PLAT APPROVAL.
   The land improvements which are hereby required shall be designed, furnished
and installed by the developer in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and other applicable provisions of these Codified Ordinances. The
improvements shall be installed before the final plat is approved, unless
agreements to install them are approved concurrently with the approval of the
final plat and their completion has been satisfactorily guaranteed. No permit
with respect to any activity or construction upon a lot shall be issued until
after such final plat has been approved and recorded.
   The developer shall dedicate or provide easements over all land required for
rights of way within the subdivision and furnish and install all improvements
to provide a complete and coordinated system of streets for the subdivision.
   1139.02  IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Land for the right of way for the opening or extension of any street
within or on the boundary of the subdivision shall be offered for dedication by
the developer, and all easements for the extensions of utilities shall be
provided.
   (b)    Improvements, such as electric, gas and telephone utilities,
pavements and other land improvements as required by this section, shall be
designed, furnished and installed as hereinafter set forth and as required by
other applicable provisions of these Codified Ordinances. The improvements
shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for the development of
the proposed subdivision and lots therein, in accordance with the standards of
the Village and the approval of the Village Engineer.
   (c)   Improvements for the proposed subdivision and each lot therein shall
be provided and installed by the developer as follows:
(1)    Grading of streets;
(2)    Drainage facilities;
(3)    Electric, gas and telephone utilities;
(4)    Pavement of streets;
(5)    Monuments; and
(6)    Street name signs.
   1139.03 GRADING.
   The grading of the street shall extend the full width of the right of way
and any grading of lots for building sites and access drives shall also be
undertaken so as to provide a readily accessible site.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.04 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot as
follows:
(a)    An enclosed storm sewer system shall be provided where a tile inlet or
an outlet with a capacity to receive the discharge is available within 2,000
feet of the subdivision or where it is determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission that storm sewers shall be provided and connected to a drainage
ditch or other water way. The system shall have a capacity to serve the
subdivision and drainage area of which it is a part. The system shall include
pipes, culverts, manholes, catch basins, drain inlets and a connection for each
lot.
(b)    The developer may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an
easement to the Village for a drainage channel not less in width than required
by the standards of the Village, or by the existing topography along the
watercourse. The developer may rechannel any watercourse through his or her
property in order to contain the storm drain flow within a lesser width. The
developer shall be responsible for clearing the drainage way of all debris as a
condition of acceptance.
(c)    The drainage system shall be designed in accordance with the standards
of the Village and the approval of the Village Engineer. The developer shall
construct and pay for all storm sewers.
      (Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.05 ELECTRIC, GAS AND TELEPHONE UTILITIES.
   The developer shall make arrangements to have electric, gas and telephone
utilities installed and submit drawings to the Village Engineer for approval.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.06  STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    Pavements. The developer shall design and construct on each local
street a pavement with a width of twenty-four feet comprised of six-inch
reinforced concrete. The width of the pavement shall be measured between the
outside edges of rolled curbs. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require
higher standards and/or greater widths than set forth above, because of
extraordinary traffic loads or unusual soil conditions in specific locations.
The preparation of the subgrade and the materials and construction of the
pavement shall be in accordance with the standards of the State of Ohio
Department of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications.
   (b)    Curbs and Gutters. Mountable concrete curbs and gutters integral with
the pavement shall be provided. Curbs shall be not less than twelve inches wide
and not more than four inches high and shall be formed with a smooth reverse
curve.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.07  MONUMENTS.
   A monument shall be accurately placed at each corner and at changes in
direction of the boundary, at each street intersection, at points of curves of
streets and at intermediate points as may be required by the Village Engineer.
The monuments shall be concrete, six by six by thirty inches long, with an iron
pin in the center or metal monuments as approved by the Village Engineer. The
top of the monument shall be set at the finished grade upon the completion of
the grading of the streets and lots.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.08 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the owner of the
subdivision if a new street is planned. The letters and numerals shall be
either three or four inches set on a reflecting material. The signs shall be
mounted at a height of approximately seven feet above the top of the curb.
Metal posts are desirable. Placement of signs shall be in accordance with the
Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways and
placed on diagonally opposite corners, on the far right-hand side of the
intersection for traffic on the more important street, and as close to the
corner as possible.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.09  EXTENSION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   If streets or electric, gas or telephone utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Village may require as a condition
precedent to approval of a preliminary plan and final plat, assurances that
such improvement extensions shall be provided. If the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds that the extensions across undeveloped areas would not be
warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties, the developer
may be required, if he or she wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain
necessary easements or rights of way and construct and pay for extensions.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.10 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND ROADWAYS.
   The design of the drainage systems and roadways shall be in accordance with
the various standards and requirements described in Sections
1139.04 and
1139.06. Drawings and specifications for the improvements shall be reviewed and
approved by the Village Engineer, and the installation shall be subject to his
or her continuous inspection. At the completion of the construction and before
acceptance, the developer shall furnish the Village a set of record or "as-
built" tracings showing the locations, sizes and elevations of all underground
utilities.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.11 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION.
   (a)    Types of Guarantees. The developer may execute and file with the
Village financial guarantees, in lieu of actual installation or completion of
the required improvements, concurrently with the application for approval of
the final plat. Such guarantees may be in the form of a performance or surety
bond, a certified check or any other type of surety approved as to form by the
Director of Law and accepted by the Village.
   (b)    Terms of Guarantees. The terms of guarantees shall be determined by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. However, they shall not be for a longer
period than eighteen months unless Council, by resolution, extends the time.
Bonds shall be executed by the applicant as principal with a surety company
authorized in the State and shall be in a form satisfactory to the Director of
Law.
   (c)    Amount of Guarantees. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total cost of materials, labor and engineering required
to install or construct the improvements, plus ten percent for contingencies.
Such costs shall be determined by the Village Engineer. When any portion of an
improvement has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily completed, a
reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the estimated
costs of such completed improvements may be authorized.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.12 STREET MAINTENANCE; GUARANTEE.
   Upon acceptance and as a condition thereof, the developer shall guarantee
the construction and material of the street improvements and shall maintain the
street improvements for a period of two years from their acceptance and the
posting of the maintenance bond herein required with the Village, in the form
approved by the Director of Law. The bond shall be in an amount of ten percent
of the financial guarantees required under Section
1139.11 for the improvements.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.13  INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE.
   The developer shall agree to indemnify and save harmless the Village against
and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and expense on account of
damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the parties involved or to a
third person, caused by, growing out of, or in any way whatsoever attributable
to, the construction of the improvements and the use of the street delineated
on the subdivision plat during the construction. The developer shall further
agree, but without limiting his or her liability, to indemnify the Village, by
carrying comprehensive general liability insurance contracts with a reliable
insurance company, covering the period of construction, in the sum of two
million dollars ($2,000,000) all occurrence coverage and five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000) property damage, which insurance contracts shall include the
Village as a named insured. The developer agrees to maintain on file with the
Village during the period of construction, certificates or memoranda of
insurance evidencing that such insurance contracts are in force.
(Ord. 1988-121. Passed 11-22-88.)
   1139.14 FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the developer fails to complete the installation of all land improvements
according to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the Village, upon
proper notice, may complete the same and appropriate such portion of money or
bonds posted for the faithful performance of such work.

1151.03    Interpretation; lot and yard areas.
1151.04    Amendments.

1151.10    Activities limited within 75 or 25 feet of protected watercourses as
identified on the Protected Watercourses Map in Appendix II.
   1151.01  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   (a)   Council finds, based on studies and investigations of professional
planners, on the knowledge of the Planning and Zoning Commission, and on its
own knowledge, that there is an existing community standard of the size of
residential structures as they relate to the size of the parcel of land upon
which they sit.
   (b)   Council also finds that the application of the identified community
standard to new residential structures as well as additions to existing
structures through the placement of a limitation on the size of such
residential structures and their accessory structures within the Village will
protect the value of neighboring residences.
(Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.02  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The general purpose of these regulations shall be to promote and protect the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare
throughout the Village of Hunting Valley by regulating and limiting the use of
land and buildings and the erection, restoration and condition of buildings and
additions thereto. It is intended that the provisions of these regulations
shall be applied to achieve the following:
   (a)   To conserve and protect open space, valuable residential property and
the reasonable use of private property by individuals;
   (b)   To regulate and restrict the bulk, height, and location of buildings;
and
   (c)   To provide that each lot not only meets the five (5) acre minimum lot
size requirement, but also maintains the building ground coverage to lot size
ratio which conforms to the requirements of this Zoning Code and reflects the
identified community standard of structures as they relate to lot size.
      (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.03 INTERPRETATION; LOT AND YARD AREAS.
   (a)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, such
provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general
welfare.
   (b)   The lot or yard area required by this Zoning Code for a particular
building shall not be diminished and shall not be included as a part of the
required lot or yard areas of any other building. The lot or yard areas of
buildings existing at the time of the passage of this Zoning Code shall not be
diminished below the requirements herein provided for buildings hereafter
erected, and such requirements as to area shall not be included as a part of
the required areas of any building hereafter erected.
   (c)   This Zoning Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any rules or
regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued
pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises, nor shall this
Zoning Code interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or
other agreements between parties, provided, however, that where this Zoning
Code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises, or
upon the height of buildings or requires larger yards than are imposed or
required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance, by such rules or
regulations, or by such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of
this Zoning Code shall control. (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.04  AMENDMENTS.
   Council may, from time to time, on its own motion or petition, after public
notice and hearing, amend the regulations and districts herein established.
Every such proposed amendment shall be referred by Council to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for a report of its recommendations. Any such amendment that
has failed to receive the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
not be passed by Council except by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of
Council. If a protest against such amendment is presented duly signed and
acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the land within the area
subject to the proposed amendment, such amendment shall not be passed except by
the affirmative vote of three-fourths of Council. If such amendment will
transfer an area to a less restricted use, height or area district and a
protest is presented duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the land adjacent to and within 200 feet of the area proposed
to be transferred and within a more restricted use, height or area district
than the district in which such area is proposed to be transferred, such
amendment shall not be passed except by the affirmative vote of three-fourths
(3/4) of Council. Whenever the owners of fifty percent (50%) of the land in any
area shall present a petition to Council, duly signed and acknowledged,
requesting an amendment to the regulations prescribed for such area, Council
shall vote upon such amendment within ninety (90) days after the filing of same
by the petitioners with the Village Clerk. If any area is hereafter transferred
to any other district by a change in the district boundaries by amendment, as
provided in this section, the provisions of this Zoning Code with regard to
buildings or premises existing at the time of the passage of this Zoning Code
shall apply to buildings or premises existing in such transferred areas at the
time of the passage of such amendments. (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.05  COMPLETION AND RESTORATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS.
   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction
or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been heretofore
issued and the construction of which shall have been diligently prosecuted
within ninety (90) days of the date of such permit, and the ground story
framework of which, including the second tier of beams, shall have been
completed within six (6) months of the date of such permit, and which entire
building shall be completed according to such plans, as filed, within two (2)
years from the date of the passage of this Zoning Code. Nothing in this Zoning
Code shalt prevent the restoration of a building wholly or partly destroyed by
fire, explosion, act of God or act of the public enemy, subsequent to the
passage of this Zoning Code, or prevent a change of such existing use under the
limitations applicable to a nonconforming use. Nothing in this Zoning Code
shall prevent the restoration of a wall declared unsafe by the Building
Inspector.

   1151.07  DISTRICTS GENERALLY AND ZONING MAP.
   For the purpose of regulating and restricting the location of single-family
houses and other uses of property, the number of square feet of lot area per
family housed, the width of lots, the location and size of yards and the height
of buildings, the Village shall consist of four (4) zoning districts termed U-
1 Single-Family Residential District, U-2 Historic Settlement District, U-
3 Institutional District, and U-4 CDD Conservation Development District. No
building or premises shall be erected or used except in conformity with the
regulations herein prescribed for the districts in which such building or
premises are located. Only those uses specifically identified as being either a
permitted principal use or an accessory use in a particular zoning district may
be permitted in that zoning district. Any use not specifically listed as a
permitted or accessory use in a zoning district shall be considered a
prohibited use in the zoning district.
(Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.08  NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (a)   Intent. Within the Village there exist lots, structures and uses of
land and/or structures which were lawful before certain provisions of this
Zoning Code were adopted, but which do not now conform to regulations and
restrictions of the Zoning Code. It is the Village's intent to permit such
nonconformities to continue. It is further intended that nonconformities not be
enlarged, expanded, nor extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other lots,
structures or uses prohibited in the same district.
   (b)   Approved Plans. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall require any change
in the plans, construction or designated use of a building for which a building
permit has been issued and the construction of which was lawfully begun prior
to the effective date of this Zoning Code or amendments hereto and on which
construction has been carried on diligently in accordance with approved plans.
   (c)   Nonconforming Lots.  Any lot of record existing at the time of the
adoption of any provision of this Zoning Code which does not meet the
requirements of said provision shall be considered buildable, provided that the
site plan for any additional construction meets all setback and yard
requirements established by this Zoning Code. No such lot or parcel or portion
thereof shall be used or sold in a manner diminishing compliance with lot width
or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Nonconforming Structures.  Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of the adoption or amendment of any provision of the Zoning Code
that could not be built under the terms of said provision by reason of
restrictions on size, height, setback (from property line, street, private road
or protected watercourse) or lot coverage, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, altered or
reconstructed in a way which increases the nonconformity.
      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure be damaged or destroyed by any
means, it may be repaired or reconstructed in-kind in the same location.
      (3)   If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful
due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by a duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (4)   Any structure which is nonconforming solely because of its
encroachment in a required setback may be expanded or extended in any lawful
manner that does not increase the nonconformity.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses. Where, at the passage of any provision of this
Zoning Code, a lawful use of land and/or structures exists which would not be
permitted by said provision, the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, provided:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of the
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code;
      (3)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use;
      (4)   When any nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the
use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and no
nonconforming use shall thereafter be resumed;
      (5)   If any such nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of
more than twelve (12) consecutive months, any subsequent use shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Zoning Code;
      (6)   Removal or destruction of the structure occupied by such
nonconforming use shall eliminate the nonconforming status. Destruction for the
purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than sixty
percent (60%) of the replacement cost. No nonconforming use shall be
established after said destruction or removal; and
      (7)   If a nonconforming use is altered so as to increase its conformity,
it may not, at any time, revert to its previous level of nonconformity.
         (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1151.09  CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WITHIN 300 FEET OF CHAGRIN RIVER
OR 100 FEET OF THE 100-YEAR FLOOD PLAIN, WHICHEVER DISTANCE IS GREATER.
   (a)   Construction.  There shall be no construction of any kind within 300
feet of the Chagrin River, measured from the ordinary high-water mark along its
banks, or within 100 feet of the 100-year flood plain, as established by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"), whichever distance is greater.
   (b)   Discharge.  There shall be no discharge into the Chagrin River or its
tributaries, directly or indirectly, of liquid or solid materials which, due to
their toxic properties or temperatures, would cause contamination, as
determined by Ohio Environmental Protection Agency standards.
   (c)   Drilling, Filling, Dredging or Dumping.  There shall be no drilling,
filling, dredging or dumping of soil, spoil, or liquid or solid materials
within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of the Chagrin River, or within
100 feet of the 100-year flood plain as established by FEMA, whichever distance
is greater, except for erosion control measures which are ecologically
compatible and which substantially utilize natural materials indigenous to the
region.
   (d)   Natural Vegetation.  There shall be no disturbance of the natural
vegetation within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of the Chagrin
River, or within 100 feet of the 100-year flood plain as established by FEMA,
whichever distance is greater, except such conservation maintenance as may be
necessary to control noxious plants and for such plantings as are consistent
with sound field and/or wood lot maintenance, as may be recommended or approved
by the Hunting Valley Conservation Commission.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses.  A nonconforming use, existing at the time of the
passage of this section and within the area of the 300-foot restricted setback
from the Chagrin River, may be continued, but may not be changed, unless
changed to a use permitted under this section. A nonconforming use which is
discontinued, terminated, or abandoned may not be revived, restored or re-
established.
   
   (f)   Variances. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of
this section, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to vary, in
specific cases, the application of the provisions of this section in harmony
with its general purpose and intent, so that the public health, safety and
general welfare may be secured and substantial justice done, in accordance with
the provisions of Section
1153.05.

spoils, liquid or solid materials, except for noncommercial composting of
uncontaminated natural materials, within seventy-five (75) feet or within
twenty-five (25) feet of a Protected Watercourse as identified on the
"Protected Watercourses" Map prepared by the Chagrin River Watershed Partners,
as set forth in
Appendix II on file with the Building Inspector of the Village.
   (b)   There shall be no disturbance of the natural vegetation within
seventy-five (75) feet or within twenty-five (25) feet of any protected
watercourse, as duly noted on the "Protected Watercourses" Map, except for
conservation maintenance necessary to control noxious weeds and such plantings
as are consistent with sound environmental maintenance.

taken by any person aggrieved by any decision of the Building Inspector. Such
an appeal shall be taken within twenty (20) days after the decision by filing a
notice of appeal with the Building Inspector's office specifying the grounds
thereof. All appeals and applications made to the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
be in writing and on forms provided and shall be accompanied by such fee as may
be set by Village Council. The Building Inspector shall transmit to the Board
of Zoning Appeals all the papers constituting the record regarding the action
being appealed. Every appeal or application shall refer to the specific
provision of this Zoning Code that is the subject of the variance, appeal or
determination, and shall set forth the interpretation that is claimed, the
details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it is
claimed that the variance should be granted as the case may be.
   (b)   Action and Reapplication.   The Board shall decide each appeal within
a reasonable period of time after it is submitted. No variance or appeal which
is disapproved by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be resubmitted for

Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Notice and Hearing.   Upon receipt of a completed application for an
appeal or a variance, the Building Inspector shall transmit said application to

prior to the hearing, excluding the day of mailing and including the day of the
hearing.
   (d)   Testimony. At the public hearing, any person may appear in person or
by attorney and shall have the opportunity to give testimony under oath.
   (e)   Area Variances. Where the appeal requests an area variance, that is, a
variance involving provisions relating to yard dimensions, setback, height, or
similar spatial or dimensional requirements, then the following standards shall
be considered and weighed in determining whether the grant of a variance is
warranted to afford relief of practical difficulties:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return and
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
Increased cost only shall not be the basis for a variance.
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial.
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
substantially altered and whether adjoining properties will suffer a detriment
as a result of the variance.
      (4)   Whether the variance will adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament can be obviated through
some method other than a variance.
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent of the Zoning Code will be observed
and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (8)   Whether granting of the variance will be contrary to the general
purpose, intent, and objective of the specific use district.
      (9)   Whether the variance requested arises from a condition or
circumstance which is unique to the subject site and which is not generally
shared by other properties in the same zoning district or general vicinity.
      (10)   Whether the practical difficulty is created by the Zoning Code and
not by any action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
      (11)   Whether the variance desired will adversely affect the public
health, safety, or general welfare.
      (12)   Whether the variance requested is the minimum variance necessary
to afford relief to the property owner.
      (13)   If there are deed restrictions, whether such restrictions have
been released and whether the applicant has established the right to request
the variance being sought.
   (f)   Issuance.   A variance shall not be granted unless the Board of Zoning
Appeals makes a determination that the criteria contained herein are
satisfactorily addressed by the evidence presented by the applicant to
establish that a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship exists and that
the granting of a variance will preserve the spirit and intent of this Zoning
Code and that substantial justice will be done.
   (g)   Conditions and Safeguards.   In granting any appeal or variance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this Zoning Code, which shall become stipulations of the
variance or appeal. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1153.06  APPEALS.

decision in the manner prescribed by law.

provision of this Zoning Code, or fails to comply therewith or with any of the
requirements thereof, after having been notified by the Building Inspector of
such violation or failure to comply, shall constitute a separate offense.

without the prior review and approval of the Village Engineer, who shall
determine whether there is sufficient water within the watershed to support
such water feature, and determine whether the design of the water feature is
sufficient to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. The
setback regulations contained herein shall not prevent abutting property
owners, who agree to share the maintenance of a pond located on a shared
boundary, from locating such pond on the shared boundary, provided that the
terms of the maintenance agreement are approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and are binding upon the property owners, their successors, heirs
and assigns.

   (a)   Density of Dwelling Units. The maximum density of dwelling units shall
be as set forth on the approved Development Plan. In no case shall the density
be greater than the lesser of one (1) dwelling unit per five (5) acres or the
permitted density determined by a "yield plan" for a conventional five (5) acre
lot subdivision which conforms to all Village regulations. The determination of
permitted density shall not include any areas designated as flood plain or
which are covered by an existing conservation easement.
   (b)   Open Space.
      (1)   Permanent open space shall be as set forth on the Final Approved
Development Plan; provided, however, that the land area designated for
permanent open space shall not be less than fifty-five percent (55%) of the
total land area of the Conservation Development. Common open space shall be
located and designed to be integrally related to the overall design of the
development and to conserve and protect significant natural features such as
wetlands, woodlands, streams, lakes, historic features, and environmentally
sensitive areas. Common open space shall be kept in its natural state except
for generally accepted woodland and field management practices.

with the standards and specifications of the Village Engineer.
      (3)   Each dwelling unit shall have access to a public street or to a
private street internal to the Conservation Development District in a manner
approved by the Village and said access shall be clearly defined on the
development plan.
   (f)   Setbacks and Separations. Building setbacks and separations shall be
as established on the approved final development plan. In establishing said
separations, Village Council shall consider the spacing necessary for adequate
visual and acoustical privacy, adequate light and air, fire and emergency
access, building configurations, energy-efficient siting, and the relationships
of building sites to circulation patterns. In no instance shall the established
setbacks and/or separations be less than the following:
      (1)   No building, structure, or parking area shall be located closer
than two hundred (200) feet to the right-of-way line of an existing public or
private street.
      (2)   No building, structure, lighting or parking area shall be located
closer than one hundred (100) feet to any project boundary line.

the form of a bulb or tube which utilizes a phosphor as the light-emitting
element.
   (e)   "Full Cut-off Luminaire" means a type of fixed directional outdoor
luminaire which emits no light above a horizontal plane through the optical
center of the luminaire or, alternatively, above an angle of ninety (90)
degrees where zero (0) degrees is the aim point on the ground directly beneath
the luminaire.
   (f)   "Fully Shielded Luminaire" means a luminaire equipped with opaque
hoods, louvers or visors so as to completely block the light from going in
other than a specified direction.
   (g)   "Glare" means the visual sensation produced by brightness in the field
of view that is sufficiently greater than the light level to which the eyes are
adapted so as to cause annoyance, discomfort or loss of visibility.
   (h)   "Halogen Light Source" means an incandescent lamp with a halogen gas
filling typically designed to increase energy efficiency and lengthen lamp life
compared to standard incandescent lamps.
   (i)   "HID Light Source" means a lamp which utilizes a small gas arc
discharge or "high intensity discharge" as the light emitter. Examples of HID
light sources are mercury, metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps.
   (j)   "Incandescent Light Source" means a lamp containing a tungsten wire
filament heated to a high temperature as the light-emitting element.
   (k)   "Lamp" means a bulb, globe, tube or capsule, usually formed out of
glass, containing an electrical and physical assembly of materials designed to
convert electricity into light.
   (l)   "Light Pollution" means wasted light directed into the sky which
results in sky glow and the loss of the natural beauty and visibility of the
sky and stars.
   (m)   "Light Source" means the light emitting portion (filament, arc tube or
element) of a lamp.
   (n)   "Light Trespass" means outdoor lighting which emits unwanted light or
glare beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
   (o)   "Lumen" means the unit measure of light flux or light output from
lamps and luminaires.
   (p)   "Luminaire" means a complete lighting unit typically consisting of all
electrical and mechanical parts necessary for operation including a lamp,
ballast (in the case of discharge lamps), optical assembly and enclosure.
   (q)   "Luminaire Mounting Height" means the vertical distance between the
ground and the optical center of the luminaire in an outdoor lighting system.
   (r)   "Optical Center of Luminaire" means the point inside of a luminaire at
the middle of the light emitting area of the light source.
   (s)   "Recreational Lighting" means lighting of ball fields, courts, pools,

      (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1161.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   This chapter is intended to preserve and protect the nighttime
lighting environment for residents and to maintain the established rural
village atmosphere of the community by controlling the installation and use of
exterior illumination to prevent glare from bright light sources, light
trespass and light pollution.
   (b)   This chapter is intended to regulate exterior illumination to ensure
it is functional, glare-free, energy efficient and safe. Owners and designers
are to consider the impact of their lighting on their neighbors' properties and
to minimize that impact in the design phase.
   (c)   The specific goals are to:
      (1)   Preserve the nighttime rural-village atmosphere of the community;
      (2)   Prevent glaring and offensive lighting;
      (3)    Conserve energy and encourage the use of efficient lighting
technology;
      (4)    Promote safety;
      (5)    Prevent light pollution;
      (6)    Provide clear guidance to builders, contractors and residents;
      (7)    Minimize environmental impacts on light sensitive flora and fauna.
         (Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1161.03  APPLICABILITY, NON-CONFORMING LIGHTING, AND COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   New Construction. All construction initiated after the effective date
of this legislation must meet the requirements set forth herein and shall be
reviewed for compliance with the provisions hereof by the Architectural Board
of Review. Supporting documentation may be required which specifies lamp
lumens, luminaire description, mounting height and arrangement, shielding and
placement details. A "Full Lighting Plan" shall be required as specified in
Section
1161.04(a) and shall be provided to the Architectural Board of Review as part
of the permitting process.
   (b)   Existing Exterior Lighting. Existing exterior lighting that does not
conform to the requirements of this legislation shall be brought into
compliance as part of any addition to, modification of, and/or replacement of
such lighting, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Permits. The Building Inspector may issue permits for minor
replacements or extensions of exterior lighting systems without requiring a
Full Lighting Plan and evidence of conformance provided that:
      (1)   The residential lighting system was in existence prior to the
effective date of this regulation;
      (2)   The total initial lumen rating of the proposed improvement does not
exceed 2,500 lumens; and
      (3)   Not more than one such permit shall be issued per residential
property per each 365 days.
   (d)   Lighting Nuisance.  Exterior lighting which does not comply with this
regulation is declared to be a public nuisance. Upon receipt of a lighting
complaint the Building Inspector shall investigate to determine compliance. If
lighting is found to be in violation of these provisions the Building Inspector
shall proceed as set forth in Section
1161.09.
(Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1161.04  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Lighting Plans.  Full lighting plans shall be required prior to the
installation of any lighting improvements or fixtures. Lighting plans shall
show the following:
      (1)   The location and height above grade of the luminaires.
      (2)   The lumens and type of each light source such as incandescent,
fluorescent, metal halide, etc.
      (3)   The general type and appearance of each luminaire such as lantern,
globe, floodlight, full-cutoff area luminaire, wall pack, downlight, etc.
      (4)   Calculated or manufacturer-rated numerical values of total light
output (lumens) of the luminaire or luminaires and the light output above a
horizontal plane through the optical center of the luminaire if the light
output per lamp is greater than allowed by this regulation.
      (5)   Building walls to be illuminated by wall mounted or facade-mounted
luminaires in conformance with Section
1161.05(c) including relevant building elevations showing the location of the
luminaires, their aiming direction and aiming angle (if directional), the
portions of the building walls to be illuminated, and their color.
   (b)   Light Trespass. An exterior lighting system is considered to produce
excessive light trespass when the light source (the light emitting portion of
the lamp) is visible from normal viewing positions on an adjoining property and
the maximum light output per lamp is greater than allowed by Section
1161.05. 
   (c)   Light Pollution. An exterior lighting system is considered to
contribute excessively to light pollution when light is emitted above a
horizontal plane through the optical center of the luminaire and if the maximum
light output per lamp is greater than allowed by Section
1161.05.
   (d)   Glare.  An exterior lighting system is considered to produce glare
when the light source inside the luminaire is visible as seen from normal
viewing positions whether or not the light from the source is diffused or
refracted by lens optics, and the light output per lamp is greater than allowed
by Section
1161.05. 
   (e)   Lighting Controls.  To minimize the amount of light trespass, light
pollution, excess lighting and energy use at night, unnecessary lighting shall
be switched off. The use of photocell or photocell/timer switches which allow
lighting to operate all night is prohibited. Motion sensor switches which turn
lights on only when activated by motion and only for a set period of time after
motion ceases are permitted.
(Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-15-23.)
   1161.05 RESIDENTIAL LIGHTING.
   The following lighting standards shall apply to residential property.
   (a)   The total light output of all exterior lighting shall not exceed
75,000 lumens for any residential property, provided, however that the total
aggregate light output of all exterior lighting in any Conservation Development
District shall not exceed a maximum of 37,500 lumens per dwelling unit. Total
lumens shall be calculated by adding the manufacturer initial lumen rating for
each lamp type to obtain a total lumen value.
   (b)   All exterior lighting shall be designed and installed to avoid glare
and light trespass on adjoining properties and public rights of way.
   (c)   Wall or Facade Mounted Lighting.  Wall mounted fixtures and/or facade
mounted luminaires shall be used solely for illuminating entrances and walkways
and shall not be used or designed for building architectural illumination.

100 feet of a grade which exceeds twenty percent, unless the applicant has
either:
(1)    Secured a permit pursuant to Chapter
1325 for the grading, excavation and filling of such land which will reduce
such grade below twenty percent, and any building permit issued shall be
conditioned on the applicant satisfactorily completing such operations pursuant
to the conditions of the permit issued pursuant to Chapter
1325, prior to the commencement of construction of such structure; or
(2)    Secured a permit pursuant to Chapter
1330, provided, however, that with respect to structures which are additions to
an existing structure, a building permit may be issued in that instance if the
applicant has provided to the Building Inspector data or reports of the nature
contemplated in Sections
1325.02 and
1339.05, including, but not limited to, engineering studies relating to an
evaluation of the present stability, erosion control and drainage of the site
(including, when a stream or channel is present, an evaluation of any possible
streambank erosion) and the existing structure thereon and the stability,
erosion control and drainage of the structure, the property and adjoining
properties after the planned construction of such additions to that existing
structure, including the effect of the planned removal and replanting of trees
on the property on erosion control and surface water run-off, evidencing, to
the satisfaction of the Building Inspector, that the existing structure and
property are stable and that the planned construction of such additions to that
existing structure will not result in any instability of such property, such
existing structure, such planned additions or adjoining properties, and also
will not adversely contribute to the erosion of soils, significantly increase
the surface water run-off therefrom, contaminate ground water or otherwise
adversely affect subsurface water conditions. (Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)

as well as the footprint, i.e. the area, in square feet, of each building or
structure on the ground.
   1303.07 SUBMISSION OF PLANS TO BUILDING INSPECTOR.
   (a)   Before final construction drawings are prepared by the architect, the
architect or owner shall file in duplicate, with the Building Inspector,
preliminary plans and elevations for the tentative approval of the design,
pursuant to Chapter
1309 of this Code, not less than ten (10) working days before the next meeting
of the Architectural Board of Review or, when applicable, the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Preliminary plans and elevations received after the deadline
will be heard at the next meeting subsequent to the meeting for which the
deadline was set unless the Chairman of the Board or Commission, for good
cause, waives the deadline.
   (b)   The owner or his or her agent shall file, in triplicate, with the
Building Inspector, a permit application, plans, elevations, specifications and

   (a)    When specifications and drawings so submitted shall be found to
conform to the requirements of this Building Code, the Building Inspector shall
issue a permit and affix to the specifications and drawings his or her official
stamp, stating that examination has been made and a permit issued. One copy of
such stamped specifications and plans shall be returned to the applicant and
shall be continuously kept at the site of the proposed work throughout its
construction period. The second copy shall be filed with the permanent records
of the Building Inspector. The stamping of any specification or drawing shall
not be held to permit or be an approval of any violation of any section of this
Building Code, nor shall the issuance of any permit for a part of the structure
be held to imply or require the approval of any remaining part of such
structure for which complete specifications and drawings were not submitted at
the time of issuance of the permit for a part of the structure.
   (b)    Any permit so issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized
by the permit shall have been commenced within six months after the date of its

Inspector.
   (c)    Upon issuing a building permit, the Building Inspector shall fix the
reasonable time necessary to complete the work authorized by the permit, taking
into consideration the time for completion as estimated by the applicant, the
nature of the work and the effect of seasonal and weather conditions, and shall
note the completion date on the building permit.
   (d)    Upon completion of the work authorized by the permit in accordance
with the plans, specifications and drawings, the owner, builder or his or her
representative shall request a final inspection by the Building Inspector. No
building shall be used or occupied until its completion, in accordance with the
plans, specifications and drawings, has been approved by the Building
Inspector. Upon application and for good cause shown, the Building Inspector
may extend the completion date for delays caused by conditions beyond the
control of the owner or builder, or for other good and sufficient reasons.
   (e)    Within six months from the date originally fixed by the Building
Inspector for the completion of the work authorized by the permit, the property
upon which the building is located shall be finish graded and seeded or sodded
with quality grass seed or sod or planted with other ground cover in accordance
with the site improvement plan submitted with the application for a building
permit and shall be continuously maintained thereafter.
   (f)    Failure to complete the work authorized by the permit or failure to
grade and seed or sod the property, as required by the provisions of this
section, shall constitute a violation of this Building Code.

or deviation, in any manner affecting the structural features or the stability
of the structure, from the terms of any application, specification or drawing,
unless the permission of the Building Inspector shall, previous to the
commencement of such change or deviation, have been asked and granted, both in
writing.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1303.12 WHEN PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.

The appellant and the Building Inspector may present and examine witnesses and
introduce testimony pertaining to the reasons for suspension or revocation and
to restoration of the Certificate of Registration. All such appeals shall be
filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission within five days after receipt of
the notice or order from which an appeal is taken. The decision of the Planning

   1309.01 POLICY AND INTENT.
   (a)    The Village of Hunting Valley grew from nineteenth century farms into
a twentieth century community of large, private estates. These properties,
created over the past centuries, demonstrate a high level of architecture and
landscape design that, combined, result in an exceptional scenic environment.
Although there are many different architectural styles represented in the
Village, the majority follow traditional classical and medieval themes and
share the attribute of blending with the natural and man-made landscapes. It is
this tradition that the Village desires to perpetuate into the twenty-first
century.
   (b)    The Architectural Board of Review has been formed to meet this
desire. The Board will closely consult with those who plan to build or rebuild
their homes within the Village. The recommendations of the Architectural Board
of Review are intended to assure that the traditional qualities of exterior
design excellence and landscape harmony are preserved. For example, a new house
may be designed in a contemporary style, but its exterior size, shape,
materials, color and texture should be compatible with existing houses and it
should fit into its site and its scenic surroundings so as to be as
complementary and unobtrusive as possible. There are many ways in which these
goals can be achieved. The Architectural Board of Review will assist new and
existing Village residents by early review of preliminary plans and provide
guidance on appropriate exterior design and landscaping. With cooperation
between Village officials and residents, the Village will not only remain the
desirable place to live that it is today, but will become even more attractive
in the years ahead.
(Ord. 2000-110. Passed 4-11-00.)
   1309.02 ARCHITECTURAL BOARD OF REVIEW; MEETINGS; RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)    The Architectural Board of Review shall hold regular monthly meetings
at the Council Chambers of the Village of Hunting Valley, and such other
meetings as the Board may determine, or at the call of the Chairman. Notice of
all such meetings shall be given according to law.
   (b)    The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member on each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicate such
fact, and shall also keep records of its examinations and other official
actions. Approval or conditional approval of an application shall only be
granted upon an affirmative vote of three members ofthe Board. The Board shall
have power from time to time to adopt, amend, and repeal rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Ohio and the Village's Charter
and ordinances, governing its procedure under the provisions of this chapter,
and to put into effect the purposes of the Board, set forth in
Article VII, Section 6 of the Village Charter, and any standards set forth in
this chapter.
(Ord. 2000-110. Passed 4-11-00.)
   1309.03 PRELIMINARY REVIEW; FINAL REVIEW; APPROVAL PROCEDURE; APPEAL.
   (a)    Preliminary Review; Suggestions; Preliminary Approval. Any person who
seeks to construct or alter a structure within the Village which, in any
manner, affects the exterior design of said structure, shall obtain preliminary
review of the proposed design before an application for final approval will be
accepted for review. The preliminary review shall be made of conceptual
sketches and sketch plans which convey the general nature of the architectural
floor plans; the site plan indicating the topography, existing tree cover, and
related access roadways; the context and/or visual relationship to adjacent
residences and properties; and the visual massing and appearance of all sides
of the proposed structure. All applicants for proposed new construction or
alterations to existing buildings are strongly encouraged to present their
conceptual designs as early as possible and prior to making major design
commitments to their architect or contractor, so that the Architectural Board
of Review may offer timely and appropriate guidance to such applicants. The
Board may make suggestions regarding the proposed design, and indicate any
problems the applicant is likely to encounter if final plans are presented in
conformance with the preliminary plans. The Board shall grant preliminary
approval if the Board determines that the proposed design presented in the
preliminary plans is sufficient to warrant final plans. If the Board does not
grant preliminary approval, it shall verbally advise the applicant of the
reasons preliminary approval was not granted.
   (b)    Final Review. Each application for final approval by the
Architectural Board of Review shall have scale drawings including: 1) a site
plan showing the proposed building location, property boundary lines,
topography and any prominent ground or site features; 2) floor plans; 3)
elevations; 4) transverse and longitudinal sections; and written
specifications, that, taken together, provide a detailed description of the
site placement, size, volume and appearance of the proposed building. The
applicant shall also submit a plan of any landscape features which are to be
installed as a part of the proposed project.
   (c)    Approval; Disapproval. If the Architectural Board of Review finds,
upon final review, that the exterior design and accompanying documents conform
to the requirements of the Village Charter and ordinances, it may approve the
application. If such design and documents do not conform, it may conditionally
approve them by specifying modifications which would make the same acceptable.
If the Board finds the exterior design for a building or structure would
produce one or more of the harmful effects set forth in
Section 6(d)(4) of Article VII of the Charter of the Village, or otherwise not
comply with this chapter, the Board shall disapprove the application, design
and accompanying documents. In the event the Board fails to act upon the plans
within 120 days of the filing date of the application, the application will be
deemed to be approved.
(Ord. 2001-110. Passed 4-9-01.)
   (d)    Appeal to Council. If the Architectural Board of Review disapproves
any application or makes any determination adverse to the applicant, the
applicant shall have twenty (20) days after announcement of the decision to
file a notice of appeal to Council of that decision. Such notice shall be filed
with the Building Inspector. Council shall place the matter for hearing on the
agenda for the next regular Council meeting following the filing of the notice
of appeal, provided that the notice of appeal is filed at least ten (10) days
prior to the next Council meeting; otherwise Council shall place the appeal on
the agenda of the subsequent regular meeting. Council shall decide the appeal
within ninety days of the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the applicant
requests additional time for decision. A failure by Council to decide the
matter within ninety (90) days of the notice of appeal shall be deemed to be an
affirmance of the decision of the Board. The decision of Council shall be final
within the Village. In the event Council reverses or modifies the decision of
the Architectural Board of Review, the Mayor shall endorse the approval or
modification, ordered by Council, as provided in Section
1309.04(b).
(Ord. 2009-101. Passed 3-10-09.)
   1309.04 APPROVAL OF DESIGN; ENDORSEMENT OF PLANS.
   (a)   Preliminary Approval. Preliminary approval shall be marked upon the
conceptual drawings of the residence or other structure(s). Preliminary
approval shall be evidence that the concepts presented are acceptable to the
Architectural Board of Review, and the project should proceed to final
drawings.
   (b)   Final Approval. Final approval or disapproval of the plot plan and of
the design and accompanying documents shall be endorsed thereon by the
Architectural Board of Review by its Chairman, or by the Mayor in the event of
Councilmatic action, as described in Section
1309.03(d). In the event the Board or Council issues conditional approval, the
conditions shall be noted in writing upon the appropriate plans to which the
conditions apply. The Building Inspector shall not issue any building permit
for any application which has not received final approval, nor shall any
building permit be issued for any application which has granted conditional
approval, unless and until the conditions noted on the plans have been
satisfied.
   (c)   Expiration of Approval. A Final Approval granted pursuant to this
section shall expire one year after the date of the meeting at which it is
granted if no building permit is obtained pursuant to Chapter
1303. In the event a building permit is obtained, the Final Approval shall
expire when the building permit expires. In the event that the building permit
is renewed, the Final Approval shall be deemed to be renewed. In the event the
building permit expires and is not renewed, Final Approval of the Architectural
Board of Review must be obtained pursuant to this section before a new building
permit may be issued.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 3-13-17.)
   1309.05 CHANGES FROM APPROVED PLANS PROHIBITED.
   (a)    No person may alter plans which have been approved by the
Architectural Board of Review in any manner which affects the exterior
appearance of the building or other structure which is being erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, extended, enlarged or otherwise altered.
   (b)    No person shall erect, construct, reconstruct, move, extend, enlarge
or otherwise alter a building in a fashion which is in any way inconsistent
with plans approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
(Ord. 2000-110. Passed 4-11-00.)
   1309.06 EVALUATION STANDARDS.
   (a)    Excessive Dissimilarity. The exterior design of a building or
structure, site plan or landscape plan shall not be excessively dissimilar to
any other existing building, structure, site plan or landscape plan in the
immediate vicinity of the proposed building, structure, site plan or landscape
plan. For the purposes of this section, a building, structure, site plan or
landscape plan shall be deemed to be "existing" if a valid permit has been
issued for its construction.
   (b)    Excessive Similarity. The exterior design of a building, structure,
site plan or landscape plan shall not be excessively similar in relation to any
other building, structure, site plan or landscape plan, existing or for which a
permit has been issued, on a lot within 750 feet of the proposed site,
particularly any of the following features of exterior design.
(1)    Facade. An elevation shall not be apparently identical, including the
size and arrangement of either doors, windows, porches, or other openings or
breaks in the facade, nor shall there be a directly reverse arrangement;
(2)    Other significant features. Architectural features, including but not
limited to materials, roof line, or other design elements shall not be
apparently identical.
   (c)   Inappropriate Design. If, based upon evidence in the record, the Board
determines that a building, structure, addition, site plan or landscape plan is
inconsistent with the predominant architectural style of the residence, or
neighboring residences, or is otherwise inconsistent with other elements of the
design of the building, structure, site plan or landscape plan, the Board may
make a finding that the design is inappropriate.
   (d)    Harmful Effects of Design. In order to make a valid determination of
excessively similar, dissimilar or inappropriate design, the Board must also
issue a finding or findings, based upon the evidence in the record, that such
similarity, dissimilarity or inappropriateness will produce one of the harmful
effects identified in
Section 6(d)(4) of Article VII of the Village Charter.
(Ord. 2000-110. Passed 4-11-00.)
   1309.07 INSPECTIONS; PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE.
   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for making inspections
sufficient to enforce this chapter. In the event the Building Inspector
determines it is necessary to obtain professional assistance in determining
whether or not a building or structure is being constructed in accordance with
the terms of the permit issued hereunder, he shall, at the direction of the
Mayor, have the authority to engage the services of a professional architect to
provide such assistance.
(Ord. 2000-110. Passed 4-11-00.)
   1309.08 SMALL CELL/TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Guidelines. The Architectural Board of Review shall enact and revise
Design Guidelines for “small cell facilities” as that term is defined in
Section 4939.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, and the accessory equipment, which
are to be located anywhere in the Village, whether in a right of way or
elsewhere. The authority to revise and modify the Design Guidelines shall cover
technological advances which may change the way wireless signals are broadcast
to consumers of wireless services. The Design Guidelines shall reasonably
regulate the location and design of “small cell facilities” and accessory
equipment so as to prevent the adverse impact of a location or design on a
property or the public, while not unreasonably interfering with the rapid
deployment of new telecommunications technologies.
   (b)   Compliance. No person may erect a small facility, its accessory
equipment, or any similar telecommunication facility or equipment in the
Village without first obtaining the approval of the Architectural Board of
Review and a building permit. In reviewing the permit request, the
Architectural Board of Review shall reasonably apply the Design Guidelines to
achieve the objectives of this ordinance.
   (c)   Appeal. The administration of the Design Guidelines shall be subject
to the appeal provisions found in Section
1309.03 of the Codified Ordinances of Hunting Valley.
   (d)   Penalty. The failure to comply with the provisions of this section,
the Design Guidelines promulgated by the Board and the decisions of the Board
in the administration of the Guidelines shall be subject to the penalties set
forth in Section
1309.99 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2018-14. Passed 8-14-18.)
   1309.99 PENALTIES; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)    Any owner of any building or premises, or part thereof, who violates
the terms of this chapter, or any architect, builder or contractor who assists
in the commission of any such violation, or any person who fails to comply with
an order of the Architectural Board of Review, shall, for each violation or
failure to comply, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree, which
shall be punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) and a
jail sentence of up to sixty days, or both. Each day such violation or failure
to comply exists shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)    In lieu of or in addition to prosecution for any criminal violation
authorized by subsection (a) hereof, the Law Director may, at the direction of
the Mayor, institute an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper
jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful condition; to restrain, correct or abate a
violation; to prevent the occupancy of buildings, structures or premises which
violate this chapter; or to require compliance with this chapter or other
applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, or the orders of the
Architectural Board of Review.

   1325.01 GRADING, EXCAVATING AND FILLING; PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION.
   Inasmuch as the grading, excavating or filling of land results in the
removal and disturbance of topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand,
gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from land; results in
noise and the creation of large quantities of dust, which prove obnoxious to
inhabitants in the vicinity thereof; creates erosion and drainage problems,
swamps and ponds and frequently results in damage to adjoining properties by
disturbing the substructure thereof and tends to have a disrupting effect on
water supplies, and other similar dangers to public health and safety; results
in unsightly and blighted areas unfit for other and useful purposes, thus
retarding or preventing their development, depressing property and other values
in the neighborhood and permanently destroying the land, leaving it almost
valueless for any purpose; creates highway hazards due to the presence of heavy
trucks and other equipment on the roads, and due to the scattering of earth and
debris thereon; and inasmuch as such operations, unless properly planned,
regulated and supervised, have an adverse effect upon the public peace, health,
safety and general welfare; any person, firm, corporation or other entity
wishing to change the contours of land by grading, excavating or filling,
resulting in the removal and disturbance of topsoil, trees and other
vegetation, loam, sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances
from land located in any area or place within the Village (except as provided
in Section 
1325.06), shall, prior to commencing or continuing any such operation, file
with the Building Inspector a written application for permission to carry on
such operations, which application shall contain the following information:
(a)   The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the
owner of the land if it is different from that of the applicant;
   (Ord. 1992-01. Passed 1-14-92.)
(b)    A description of the land, with boundaries, upon which such operations
are proposed to take place. A map of the land showing its location and
dimensions and indicating the areas intended to be graded, excavated or filled
and delineating the extent of required riparian setback areas as set forth in
Section
1155.12(a) of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (Ord. 2000-145. Passed 10-9-01.)
(c)    The method of operation to be employed; the time within which such work
is to be commenced and completed; the existing and proposed topography of the
land and its ultimate proposed use; and the type and nature of refilling,
reseeding or replanting proposed. Such application shall also contain a
statement that the applicant and owner of the land will furnish a performance
bond for the permit to change the contours of the land by grading, excavating
or filling, in an amount deemed to be sufficient to guarantee the performance
and completion of the project in accordance with the terms of the permit, if
granted. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or by the Council, whichever shall be the approving body authorizing
the issuance of the permit, pursuant to Section
1325.05.
(d)    The name and address of any person, firm, corporation or other entity
who or which, it is contemplated, will do the actual work of grading,
excavating or filling. If any such agreement, contract, lease or other
arrangement is in writing, a copy thereof shall be attached to the application;
if such is not in writing, an explanatory statement of the arrangement shall be
made in the application.
(e)    Where deemed appropriate by the Building Inspector or the Planning and
Zoning Commission, any or all of the following additional information may be
required:
(1)    The areas of said described premises that will be exposed at any one
time;
(2)    The type of permanent and final vegetation and structure that will be
planted and installed on the said described premises and the time within which
such vegetation and structures are to be planted and installed; and
(3)    A description of the type of the soil comprising the said described
premises.
   (Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1325.02 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.

District, or from a professional land planner, civil engineer or landscape
architect who is qualified in erosion and sedimentation control measures,
stating their recommendations for adequate erosion and sediment control
measures for the proposed grading, excavating or filling operation. When the
Planning and Zoning Commission is to make a determination at a public hearing
upon the application, notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the applicant
and owner of the land, and to all abutting property owners, not less than ten
days prior to the public hearing, excluding the day of the mailing and
including the day of the public hearing. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
determines that the granting of the application will not adversely contribute
to the erosion of soils, result in the clearcutting, timbering or commercial
removal of trees, as defined in Chapter
521 of the General Offenses Code (unless a permit has been secured pursuant to
Chapter
521), significantly increase the surface water run-off from such lands,
contaminate ground water or otherwise adversely affect subsurface water
conditions, or otherwise adversely affect the public interest, health, safety
or general welfare, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall grant the
application, with such conditions relating to the method of grading, excavating
or filling of the land or area on which the operations are to be conducted, the
terms of the permit, the amount of topsoil or loam to be respread on the land,
the amount of the removal which may be permitted on the land, the refilling,
reseeding or replanting of the land, the drainage after such operations, and
such other conditions as the Commission may deem necessary for the protection
of the public interest, health, safety and general welfare, which conditions
shall be made a part of the permit and shall constitute limitations thereon.
(Ord. 1996-119. Passed 8-27-96.)
   1325.03 NOTICE OF DENIAL OF PERMIT APPLICATION.
   In the event the application is denied, notice thereof shall be mailed by
the Building Inspector to the applicant and the owner of the land at the
addresses given in the application.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1325.04  APPEALS.
   If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies the application, the applicant
or owner may appeal to Council by filing a written notice of such appeal with
the Clerk of Council within thirty days from the date of the mailing of the
notice to the applicant and the owner, as provided in Section
1325.03. The Clerk of Council shall then obtain from the Planning and Zoning
Commission the application, reports, recommendations, documents and minutes, or
copies thereof, relating to the application and the action taken thereon by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and submit the same to Council. Council, by a
two-thirds vote, may approve the application, with the same conditions as set
forth in Section

   1330.01  FINDINGS; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Inasmuch as the construction of a structure on a steep slope (as defined in
Section
1330.02) can result in an unstable structure or the destabilization of that
property or adjoining properties after such construction, can result in
difficulties in being able to provide adequate fire safety protection services,
can result in excessive deforestation leading to erosion and the reduction of
open space, and can result in an increase in the run-off of storm and surface
waters from the lot, thereby creating erosion, drainage and flooding problems,
damage to adjoining properties, detrimental effects on ground water supplies
and other similar dangers to public health and safety, and inasmuch as such
activities, unless properly planned, regulated and supervised, can have further
adverse effects upon the public welfare, peace, health and safety, any person,
firm, corporation or other entity wishing to construct a structure on a steep
slope, other than a structure which is an addition to an existing structure
with respect to which the requirements of Section
1303.05(k) of these Codified Ordinances have been met, shall also obtain, in
addition to any other permits required under these Codified Ordinances,
including a building permit under Chapter
1303 thereof, a permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)
   1330.02 STEEP SLOPE AND/OR HILLSIDE DEFINED.
   A steep slope or hillside shall contain one or more of the following
criteria:
(a)    Areas that exhibit evidence of past or present unstable soil.
(b)    Areas having slopes with a natural gradient equal to or greater than
thirty percent and where the vertical (elevation) change is twenty feet or
greater, as graphically depicted in "Exhibit A," following the text of this
chapter, which is hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. 1999-150. Passed 12-14-99.)
   1330.03  PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (a)    A written application for a permit under this chapter shall be filed
with the Building Inspector and shall contain the following information:
(1)    The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the
owner of the land if they are different from the name and address of the
applicant.
(2)    Data or reports of the nature contemplated in Sections
1325.02 and
1339.05 of these Codified Ordinances, including, but not limited to,
engineering studies relating to an evaluation of the present stability, erosion
control and drainage of the site (including, when a stream or channel is
present, an evaluation of any possible streambank erosion) and the stability,
erosion control and drainage of the property and adjoining properties after the
planned construction of such structure; the ability of fire-fighting equipment
to reach the site in light of the steepness of the grade and any other plans
with respect to other fire safety protection measures, including sprinkler
systems and firewalls; any plans for erosion and sediment control measures; any
surface water run-off control measures such as catch basins, detention or
retention areas or similar measures; identification of tree removal
contemplated to be necessary and any plans for replanting those trees and the
effect of such removal and replanting on erosion control and surface water run-
off; and any other information deemed relevant by the applicant.
(3)    The names and addresses of all abutting property owners.
   (b)    A plot plan and a site improvement plan, each prepared as required by
Section
1303.05 of these Codified Ordinances, shall accompany the application.
(Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)
   1330.04 REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS; PUBLIC HEARING; DECISION OF PLANNING
AND ZONING COMMISSION.
   The Building Inspector may request such reports and recommendations as are
necessary from various professionals to address the concerns presented by the
construction of a structure on a steep slope, including, but not limited to,
from the entity providing fire protection services to the Village, or from any
other qualified fire safety consultant, with respect to any fire safety
concerns presented by construction of the structure on a steep slope; from the
Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District, professional land planners,
civil engineers, geotechnical engineers or landscape architects qualified in
erosion, sedimentation and water run-off measures and surface and subsurface
soil conditions with respect to adequate erosion, sedimentation, water run-off
control measures and the stability of the property and adjoining properties
after such planned construction and with respect to the impact of deforestation
and replanting measures; and such other information as the Building Inspector
may deem relevant. After securing all such information as it deems necessary,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall set the matter down for a public
hearing and mail notice thereof to the applicant and owner of the land at the
addresses given in the application and to all abutting property owners not less
than ten days prior to the public hearing, excluding the day of the mailing and
including the day of the public hearing. If, after such hearing, the Planning
and Zoning Commission determines that the granting of the application will not
adversely affect the stability of the planned structure, of the property or of
adjoining properties, adversely contribute to the erosion of soils,
significantly increase the storm and surface water run-off from such lands and
flooding therefrom, contaminate ground water or otherwise adversely affect the
subsurface water conditions, present a fire safety problem or otherwise
adversely affect the public welfare, peace, health and safety, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall approve the application, with such conditions relating
to stabilization, erosion control and cutting and replanting of trees in
connection therewith, fire safety, drainage or other conditions, as the
Planning and Zoning Commission may deem necessary for the protection of the
public welfare, peace, health and safety, which conditions shall be made a part
of the permit and constitute limitations on such activities.
(Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)
   1330.05  APPEAL OF DENIAL OR CONDITIONS.
   Notice of the approval or the denial of the application shall be mailed by
the Building Inspector to the applicant and the owner of the land at the
addresses given in the application. If the Planning Commission denies the
application, or if it approves the application with conditions which the
applicant or owner finds to be onerous and unacceptable, the applicant or owner
may appeal to Council by filing a written notice of such appeal with the Clerk
of Council within thirty days from the date of the mailing of notice of the
approval or denial of the application to the applicant and the owner. The Clerk
of Council shall then obtain from the Planning and Zoning Commission the
application, reports, recommendations, documents and minutes, or copies
thereof, relating to the application and the action taken thereon by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and shall submit the same to Council. Council,
by a two-thirds vote, may approve, or modify the approval of, the application,
with such conditions as are set forth in Section
1330.04 as it deems necessary.
(Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)
   1330.06  ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; SECURITY. 
   If the application is approved, either by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or by Council, the Building Inspector shall issue a permit containing the
conditions and restrictions imposed, if any, upon the posting of a cash bond or
other form of financial guaranty approved by the Director of Law of the
Village, running in favor of the Village and conditioned upon the performance
of the permit in accordance with its terms, in the amount fixed by the
approving body. (Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)
   1330.07 DEPOSIT OF FUNDS; EXPENSES OF SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION.
   At the time of submission of the written application, the applicant shall
deposit with the Village an amount of money as determined by the Building
Inspector, but not less than three hundred dollars ($300.00), to cover the cost
and expense of such investigation as may be necessary to fully review such
application and any accompanying maps, requested reports and recommendations
from various professionals, and reports upon the same to the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The cost and expense of such investigation shall be deducted
from such deposit. If such expenditures exceed the deposit, such excess shall
be paid to the Village by the applicant, upon request. If the deposit exceeds
such expenditures, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant at the
completion of the project.
   If the application is granted, the applicant shall reimburse the Village for
any expenses incurred in connection with the Village's supervision and
inspection of the activities outlined in the permit. Statements for said
expenses shall be submitted by the Village to the permit holder and shall be
paid within thirty days of receipt. Failure to pay such statements in a timely
fashion shall constitute grounds for the revocation of the permit.
(Ord. 1993-117. Passed 11-16-93.)

natural rock or shale, footings may be omitted at the discretion of the
Building Inspector.
   (d)    Foundation walls for solid wall construction shall be of brick,
concrete, concrete block or stone. When built of brick, concrete block or
coursed stone, they shall be at least twelve inches thick where the enclosed
area is used as a basement or cellar, but may be eight inches thick when the
enclosed area is not excavated. In the latter case the foundation walls shall
be included in the allowable height of eight-inch walls. When built of concrete
poured in place, they shall be at least as thick as the walls they support, but
in no case less than sixteen inches thick.
   (e)    Foundation walls supporting hollow concrete block, hollow walls of
brick or frame construction may be of brick, concrete, concrete block, stone or
vitrified or saltglazed tile. Foundation walls shall be not less than twelve
inches thick.
   (f)    Foundation walls for frame construction shall extend at least eight
inches above the finished exterior grade at every point.

   1339.04  SUBSOIL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    When doubt arises as to the safe sustaining power of the earth upon
which a building is to be erected, the Building Inspector may order borings to
be made, or direct the sustaining power of the soil to be tested, by and at the
expense of the owner. The allowable bearing capacity and stability of the
subsoil materials shall be established by a registered geotechnical engineer.
   (b)    Where the bearing materials directly under a foundation overlie a
stratum having smaller allowable bearing values, these smaller values shall not
be exceeded at the level of such stratum. Computation of the vertical pressure
in the bearing materials at any depth below a foundation shall be made on the
assumption that the load is spread uniformly at any angle of sixty degrees with
the horizontal. However, the area considered as supporting the load shall not
extend beyond the intersection of sixty degree planes of adjacent foundations.
(Ord 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1339.05  SOILS INVESTIGATION REPORTS.
   (a)    Prior to the issuance of a building permit and in the absence of
satisfactory data or reports, such as, but not limited to, a soil investigation
by an engineer specializing in soil and foundation engineering, the Building
Inspector shall require the owner to dig pits or make borings at such
locations, carried to such depths, and with appropriate sampling, as is
reasonably calculated to disclose the character of the materials underlying the
site of the proposed structure.
   (b)    Duplicate copies of the results of all borings and pits made shall be
filed with the Building Inspector. Samples, properly protected from evaporation
or disturbance, representing the various classes of those materials, may be
requested by the Building Inspector for examination.
   (c)    Where portions of the foundation of an entire building or structure
rest directly upon or are underlain by materials having substantially different
supporting capacities, or where layers of such different materials vary greatly
in thickness, the magnitude and distribution of the probable settlement shall
be investigated, and, if necessary, the allowable load shall be reduced or
special provisions shall be made in the design of the structure to prevent
detrimental differential settlements.
   (d)    Whenever the classification or allowable bearing capacity of a soil
or rock cannot be determined by the test boring or excavation, a special soil
investigation by an engineer specializing in soil and foundation engineering is
required before approval of a building permit under this Building Code.
   (e)    Deviations from the allowable soil and rock pressures set forth in
Section
1339.04(b) and other foundation requirements may be permitted after performance
of a special soil investigation under the direction of an engineer specializing
in soil and foundation engineering. The Building Inspector may approve such
deviations only after receiving a written opinion from such engineer, together
with substantiating evidence of acceptable laboratory and field investigation
of the soils involved.
   (f)    Where the bearing capacity of the soil is not definitely known, the
Building Inspector shall require suitable load tests or other adequate proof as
to the permissible safe bearing capacity at that particular location.
Examination of subsoil conditions may be required where necessary.
   (g)    All tests, boring, excavations, samplings, reports, investigations or
inquiries required hereby shall be by and at the sole expense of the owner.

   1345.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
(a)    "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
(b)    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the Building Inspector's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
(c)    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the flood plain within
a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year.
(d)    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equalled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood also has an average
frequency of occurrence of once in 100 years and therefore may also be referred
to as the 100-year flood.
(e)    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, and
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations
located within the area of special flood hazard.
(f)    “Flood” and “flooding” mean a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
(2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation of run-off of surface waters from any
source.
(g)    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that shall be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one-half
foot at any point.
(h)    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including the basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other
than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor.
(i)    "New construction" means structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.
(j)    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground.
(k)    "Substantial improvement" is defined as follows:
(1)    Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the fair market value of the structure
either:
         A.    Before the improvement or repair is started; or
         B.    If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
(2)    The term does not, however, include either:
         A.    Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         B.    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, or with respect to
which a variance has been granted under Section
1345.03(e).
(l)    “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
this chapter.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1345.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Hunting Valley.
   (b)    The areas of special flood hazard are those areas indicated as
subject to the intermediate regional flood (that is, a flood with an average
frequency of occurrence of once in 100 years), as defined and indicated in
“Flood Plain Information, Chagrin River in the Counties of Lake and Cuyahoga,
Ohio” prepared for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water,
by the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, Buffalo District, July, 1968. Those areas
have been delineated as Zone A1(BF) on a map prepared by William Behnke
Associates, Inc., which map is on file in the office of the Clerk of Council on
the date of passage of this Building Code, and which map is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (c)    Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit, as
stated in Section
1345.03(b), no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   (d)    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restriction shall prevail.
   (e)    In the interpretation and the application of this chapter, all
provisions shall be:
(1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
(2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State
statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a State
law, such State law shall take precedence over such provision.
   (f)    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Hunting
Valley or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
   (g)    No person shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or fail
to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and
of safeguards established in connection with conditions.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1345.03 DEVELOPMENT PERMITS; DUTIES OF BUILDING INSPECTOR; APPEALS AND
VARIANCES.
   (a)    A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in
Section
1345.02(b). Application for a development permit shall be made to the Building
Inspector and may include, but shall not be limited to, plans in duplicate and
drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the
area in question, and showing existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities and their location. The application shall be
accompanied by a report of soil borings taken at the proposed construction
site. Specifically, the following information is required:
(1)    The elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including the basement, of all structures; and
(2)    A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of the proposed development.
   (b)    An application for a development permit shall not be required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting and basement sealing, or for small
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than one
thousand dollars ($1,000).
   (c)    The Building Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and
implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications
in accordance with its provisions.
   (d)    The duties of the Building Inspector under this chapter shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(1)    He or she shall review all development permits to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
(2)    He or she shall review all development permits to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required.
(3)    He or she shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source as
necessary, in order to administer Section
1345.04(b) and (c).
(4)    Where base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of special
flood hazard, regardless of the source of such data, the following provisions
apply:
         A.    He or she shall obtain and record the actual elevation, in
relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all
new or substantially improved structures.
          B.    He or she shall maintain for public inspection all records
pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
(5)    He or she shall notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse.
(6)    He or she shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in subsection
(e) hereof.
   (e)    The appeal and variance procedure shall be as follows:
(1)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the following
responsibilities and authority:
         A.    The Planning and Zoning Commission, as established by the
Charter and ordinances of the Village of Hunting Valley, shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
         B.    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Inspector in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
         C.    Those aggrieved by a decision of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Common Pleas
Court, as provided by law.
         D.    In passing upon an application, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, the
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following: the
danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; the
susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner; the importance of the
services provided by the proposed facility to the community; the necessity to
the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; the availability of
alternative locations, for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage; the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development; the relationship of the proposed use to the
Comprehensive Plan and the Flood Plain Management Program for the area in
question; the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles; the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise,
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and the cost of providing governmental
services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
         E.    Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (e)
(1)D. hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may issue such variances and upon such conditions as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
         F.    The Building Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and all variances granted.
(2)    Conditions for variances shall be as follows:
         A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot five acres in size, as the
minimum required by the Zoning Code and Zoning Map, contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, provided that the factors set forth in paragraph (e)(1)D. hereof have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond five acres, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         B.    Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this subsection and in Section
1345.04. 
         C.    Variances may be issued in conformance with the provisions of
the Planning and Zoning Code.
         D.    Variances shall not be issued within any floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         E.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         F.    Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the
granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that
which is permitted in this chapter, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the
public, as identified in paragraph (e)(1)D. hereof, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
            (Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1345.04 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)    General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following
standards are applicable:
(1)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure from resulting
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
(2)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage, using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage, and with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
(3)    All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems.
(4)    All new and replacement individual wastewater treatment systems shall be
designed to eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters and shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(5)    All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
   (b)    Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are applicable:
(1)    New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to or
above the base flood elevation, data for which shall be provided, without the
use of earth or other fill.
(2)    An exemption to the elevation standard may be granted for accessory
structures (e.g. sheds, barns, detached garages). Such structures shall comply
with the encroachment provisions of paragraph (c)(1) hereof. In addition, such
accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation; shall be designed
to have low flood damage potential; shall be constructed and placed on the
building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood
waters; shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and shall have service
facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, floodproofed.
(3)    The following provisions apply to all new and substantially improved
residential structures which are elevated to or above the base flood elevation,
using pilings, columns or posts, or which contain a crawl space. These
structures may enclose the area below the base flood elevation, provided the
following conditions are met:
         A.    Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of flood water. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect.
         B.    Alternatively, a minimum of two openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area shall
be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or
devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
Any enclosure which meets these criteria shall be considered as having met the
requirements of paragraph (a)(1) hereof.
   (c)    Encroachments. Since a floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(1)    Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, are prohibited in a floodway unless
certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2)    If paragraph (c)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
         (Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1345.99  PENALTY.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
1301.99 for general Building Code penalty if no specific penalty is provided.)

   1353.01  PURPOSE; FINAL GRADE AT BUILDINGS; OMISSION OF GUTTERS.
   It shall be the objective of grading regulations to provide grading which
will divert surface water away from buildings and dispose of such water without
harmful effects on neighboring property, to preserve desirable site features
and to provide grades and gradients for safe and convenient access to and
around buildings for their normal use and maintenance. The final grade at the
building shall not be closer than eight inches to wood or other corrodible
siding or exterior trim.
(Ord. 1997-116. Passed 7-9-97.)
   1353.02  SURFACE DRAINAGE.
   Positive drainage shall be provided for each lot or plot by proper draining
so that a nuisance will not be created. Catch basins or properly connected
under-drains shall be installed, or other approved provisions made where water
may pocket, to preclude the accumulation of surface water. Regrading shall be
done so that existing natural ground drainage of the surrounding area shall not
be impeded. When a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower level than the
natural grade on an adjacent property, the owner of such lot or plot shall
provide suitable slopes or retaining walls, or other protection approved by the
Building Inspector on his or her own property to preserve the natural slope or
surface elevation of such adjacent property.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1353.03  INSTALLATION OF FOOTING DRAINS.
   When a floor is below the adjoining ground and subsoil conditions are such
as to permit ground water to accumulate adjacent to the foundation, footing
drains shall be installed alongside the outside face of the base of the
foundation. Such drains shall be not less than four-inch diameter pipe of a
type and construction to intercept and carry ground water without permitting
the infiltration of soil into the pipe. Footing drains shall have a continuous
slope of not less than one-sixteenth of an inch per foot, discharging into the
building storm sewer or other outlet approved by the Building Inspector. No
coil or corrugated pipe shall be used. Refer to Section
1381.20.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1353.04  BACKFILL OVER FOOTING DRAINS.
   The backfill over footing drains shall be pervious material (not slag), of
the type, size and gradation required for the particular type of drain
construction being used, and shall be carried up over drain tile but not closer
than twelve inches to the established surface grade. The top twelve inches of
the backfill shall consist of six inches of an impervious (clay) soil, topped
with six inches of topsoil if the surface is to be covered with lawn or shrubs.
If the surface adjacent to the foundation wall is to be paved or have some
similar treatment, then the backfill near the top may be a suitable base for
such construction.
(Ord. 1992-101. Passed 1-14-92.)
   1353.05 ROOF AND YARD DRAINAGE.
   Roof drainage shall be handled by suitable collectors and downspouts which
shall discharge into a sealed jointed storm drain of not less than four inches
diameter with a slope of one-fourth of an inch or more per foot, or, if
collectors and downspouts are omitted, adequate drainage shall be provided by
other equally effective means in such manner as will protect the walls and
foundation from damage and as will prevent such water from flowing onto
sidewalks or walkways. Where a storm sewer or other storm drainage outlet is
not available, downspouts may discharge onto splash blocks or into other
devices, provided that no excess water will flow onto adjoining property or
over sidewalks or walkways. The storm drain outlet, carrying roof water or yard
drainage, shall be not less than six inches in diameter and shall not connect
to the footing drain, but may intercept and receive the outlet of the footing
drain by a wye connection above the spring line. The connection to a sanitary
sewer of any pipe carrying roof water or yard drainage is prohibited. See
Section
1381.20.

   1362.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to ensure to safe operation of oil and gas wells
within the Municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted to
supplement any State issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil and
gas well within the Municipality. The provisions of this chapter are based upon
local conditions which may not be known to the State at the time such drilling
was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the Municipality to exercise its
local police authority, authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the protection of the
Municipality’s residents and all emergency personnel who may be called upon to
respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.
(Ord. 2005-115. Passed 9-13-05.)
   1362.02  INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2005-115. Passed 9-13-05.)
   1362.03  MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas (“Permit Holder”)
within the Village of Hunting Valley, which permit has been issued by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources (“ODNR”), shall adhere to the following
regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the permit issued by ODNR shall be filed with the Building
Inspector not less than ten (10) days before the commencement of any operations
preparatory to drilling in the Village. Upon receipt by the Building Inspector,
a copy of such permit shall be delivered by the Building Inspector to all
owners and/or occupants of all properties which adjoin the property where a
well is to be drilled.
   (b)   With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Building
Inspector which identifies the owner(s) of the subject property where the well
is to be drilled by name and address, and identifies all persons, including but
not limited to the Permit Holder, who are responsible for the drilling and
operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a minimum, names,
mailing addresses and work telephone numbers.   
   (c)   Plan for all wells, tank batteries, all excavation work (including but
not limited to boring pits) and all other site work shall be presented to the
Building Inspector not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of any
drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of the site
and of all vehicular access to the site from any public right of way.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred feet (500) of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g. fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g. a playground) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure, or facilities, or occupants, or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Building Inspector prior to
the commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the
Permit Holder is insured by a solvent insurer, licensed to do business in the
State of Ohio, with limits of three million dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence
for personal injury and property damage.
   (h)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Building Inspector prior to the
commencement of drilling. Such information shall be immediately updated upon
any change of circumstance.
   (i)   In accordance with Ohio law, the Permit Holder shall do all of the
following:
      (1)   Remove all bore pits, and all well spoils from the subject
property; and
      (2)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of
the site to its previous elevation; and
      (3)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover, and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (4)   Notify the Building Inspector that the site has been restored
pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. The Building Inspector shall inspect
the site within five (5) days of the notification to ensure that no grading of
the property has occurred which materially alters the drainage of the subject
property in a manner which is inconsistent with the drainage of the property
prior to the commencement of any ground moving activities performed pursuant to
the ODNR permit.
   (j)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and plugging of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from access to the
greatest extent possible, in a manner consistent with ODNR regulations.
   (k)   Within six (6) months after the drilling operations have been
completed, the Permit Holder shall plant sufficient vegetation which, in
conjunction with any fencing and natural vegetation, shall effectively and
permanently screen all above-ground facilities from all neighbors and from all
public and private rights of way, while such facilities are on the subject
premises. The Building Inspector shall determine the sufficiency of the
screening and may order the Permit Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Building Inspector at least forty-
eight (48) hours notice before commencing to drill.
   (m)   The Permit Holder shall file a cash bond with the Building Inspector
in accordance with the following provisions.
      (1)   A cash bond of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per well shall be
filed with the Building Inspector to ensure the installation and maintenance of
sufficient fencing and screening of facilities, as provided herein, and also to
secure the repair or replacement of any Village owned infrastructure (e.g.
roads and culverts) which may be damaged by any activity related to oil and gas
production, including but not limited to the transportation of equipment or
materials used in any manner for oil and gas production, or for the plugging of
a well.
      (2)   No Permit Holder shall be required to file more than four (4) cash
bonds, totaling twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), which shall be deemed to be
a “blanket bond” for all additional wells drilled in the Village.
      (3)   Fencing and screening shall be installed and maintained in a manner
which accomplishes the intended goal of screening and securing the facilities.
      (4)   In the event the Village is required to utilize the bond to
install, maintain or repair the facilities which are secured by said bond, the
Permit Holder shall file with the Village sufficient funds to restore the bond
to its original amount.
      (5)   Any bond filed with the Village shall be held until such time as
all equipment has been removed from the site of the oil and gas production
facilities, the well is plugged and the site has been appropriately restored,
as required by state law. The municipality shall return the bond upon the
restoration of the site, upon the determination by the Building Inspector that
the interests to be secured by the bond are no longer at risk.
   (n)   Notwithstanding Section 509.08 of these Codified Ordinances, drilling
operations may occur twenty four hours per day until the permitted depth is
reached.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the state issued permit, or any state statute or
ODNR regulation.
   (p)   The Building Inspector or his designee shall, within two (2) business
days of receipt of the plans pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, review said
plans and immediately advise the Permit Holder if anything shown on the plans
does not comply with the regulations set forth herein.
   (q)   In the event that any Permit Holder fails to comply with the
regulations herein promulgated, the Building Inspector, shall provide written
notice to the owner of the property and the Permit Holder within forty-eight
(48) hours of the discovery of such failure to comply. Such service shall be
made to the addresses identified in paragraph (b) hereof, and if no address has
been provided, to any address identified on the permit issued by the State of
Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the Permit Holder that if they wish
to appeal the decision of the administrative official, the time for appeal is
five (5) days after service of the notice.
      (Ord. 2007-108. Passed 4-10-07.)
   1362.04  APPEAL.

promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any owner of property
or any Permit Holder may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission by
filing a notice of appeal with the Building Inspector within five (5) days of
