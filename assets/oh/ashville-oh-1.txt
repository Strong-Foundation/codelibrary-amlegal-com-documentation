component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Ashville, Ohio, 2001.
   SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a

deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

181.04 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject to
Municipal income taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the
Municipality shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the Municipality, then only such portion shall be
considered as having taxable situs in the Municipality for the purposes of
Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the Municipality, in the
absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows;
       (1)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, "real property" includes property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the Municipality to wages, salaries and other
compensation paid during the same period to persons employed in the business or
profession, wherever their services are performed.
      (3)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such results.
   (b)   Sales Made in Municipality. As used in subsection (a)(3) hereof,
"sales made in the Municipality" means:
       (1)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Ashville regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within the Village of Ashville.
       (2)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Ashville, regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the Village of Ashville, if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within the Village of Ashville and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion;
       (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Ashville to purchasers outside the Village of
Ashville, regardless of where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentage determined in accordance
with subsections (b)(1), (2) and (3) above or such of the aforesaid percentages
as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained
by the number of percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to above.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Municipality.
   (d)   Rentals. Rentals income received by a taxpayer shall be included in
the computation of net profits from business activities under Section
181.03 (a)(3), (4) and (5), only if and to the extent that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals
are derived (whether so rented, managed, or operated by a taxpayer individually
or through agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of
the taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds said two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates
a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   (e)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
       (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to June 1, 1999, allocable to the Municipality may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the
Municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
       (2)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the Municipality.
       (3)    The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

%] is levied on the municipal taxable income of every person residing in and/or
earning and/or receiving income in the Village of Ashville.
Individuals.
   (A)   For residents of the Village of Ashville, the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
192.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by

paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this

Village of Ashville for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village of Ashville shall be considered as having
a taxable situs in the Village of Ashville for purposes of municipal income
taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village of Ashville during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village of Ashville to wages, salaries, and other compensation

192.04(C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales

Village of Ashville to total gross receipts of the business or profession
during the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or
performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of

alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals

            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the Village of
Ashville to purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not,

         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Village of Ashville to the extent that such services are performed in the
Village.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Village of Ashville shall be sitused to the

royalties from real property located in the Village of Ashville shall be
sitused to the Village.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village of Ashville based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject the Village of Ashville’s tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in the Village of Ashville or
if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the

lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village of Ashville
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Village of Ashville. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Village of Ashville’s income tax ordinance. (7) When calculating the ratios
described in division (F)(1) of this section for the purposes of that division

reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, which is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;

         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an

            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 192.04 of this Chapter.

   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village of Ashville shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village of
Ashville. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
192.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.01 (B)(1) of this chapter, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or

that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or

the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B) (2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village of Ashville the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village of Ashville in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Ashville in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
      Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that
the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after
the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
          (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Ashville. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village of Ashville
as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Ashville income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Ashville the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village of Ashville income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Ashville until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
          (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village of Ashville during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the

calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Village of Ashville
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)

section, an employer is not required to withhold Village of Ashville income tax
on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the Village of Ashville if the employee performed such services in

the following conditions applies:

has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying
wages as provided in Section

            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Ashville only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Ashville than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C) (4) (b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village of Ashville exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Ashville for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village of
Ashville.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
of Ashville under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Village of Ashville for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village
of Ashville.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is in the Village of Ashville and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village of Ashville regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Village of Ashville
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

filed by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
192.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of

Ashville income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written
exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

perjury.
       (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village of Ashville to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Village of Ashville. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
       (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village of Ashville’s
income tax return. The extended due date of the Village of Ashville’s income
tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after
January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the Village of Ashville’s income tax
return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the
eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village of Ashville’s income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s Village of Ashville income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village of Ashville
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village of Ashville’s income tax return. The extended due date of the Village
of Ashville’s income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Ashville, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village of Ashville
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village of Ashville
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
the Village of Ashville an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of
this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
192.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Ashville by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village of Ashville unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Village of Ashville and the recipient colluded with
the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Village of Ashville to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
 
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village of Ashville
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Village of Ashville or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the Village of Ashville's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the Village
of Ashville's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Village of
Ashville for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Village of Ashville
during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Ashville's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Ashville income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village of Ashville. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Village of Ashville income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated Village of Ashville income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ashville income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ashville income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass- through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply.

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever

   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ashville income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Ashville in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation

         For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Ashville from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the Village of Ashville in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.

on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Ashville, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
       (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Ashville under Section
192.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of
Ashville but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-17-15.)
192.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
192.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation.
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more.
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist.
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
       (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
   192.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Ashville, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Ashville as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Ashville is subject to recovery by the
Village of Ashville. If the Village of Ashville's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the Village of Ashville shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Ashville claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the Village of Ashville's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village of Ashville's tax rate. However, if the Village of Ashville's tax rate
is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess
of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Ashville along with
any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Ashville changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Ashville. The amended return shall be filed
on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
          (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village of Ashville. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Ashville's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Ashville return showing
income subject to the Village of Ashville income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional Village of Ashville income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for
refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten
dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
          (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Ashville does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section 192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of
Section
192.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover the Village of Ashville income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-10.
Passed 12-7-15.)
192.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Ashville
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Ashville official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Village of Ashville that arises pursuant to the Village of Ashville's income
tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
 
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 12-7-15.)
192.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.

municipal corporation.

certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent

location in violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section
may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of

such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

351.14 SNOW EMERGENCY.
   (a)   Definition. A snow emergency is defined as that time when there has
been during any period of twenty-four hours or less any accumulation of sleet,
hail, or ice within the Village or accumulation of snow within the Village to a
depth of two inches or more as determined by the United States Weather Bureau
and there is a prospect of further snowfall, which accumulation, in the opinion
of the Mayor or designee, creates hazardous driving conditions and during such
period of time prior to, during and after such sleet, hail, ice or snow, the
parking of motor vehicles could hinder, delay, and obstruct the safe flow of
traffic and emergency vehicles as well as the proper cleaning and clearing of
snow in order to make safe all public streets within the Village.
   (b)   Determination. The Mayor or designee is hereby authorized to designate
any streets, within the Village, which are set forth on the Snow Emergency
Location Map attached and incorporated by reference, on which parking shall be
prohibited during snow emergencies. Such snow emergency shall continue in
effect until the Mayor or designee determines that an emergency no longer
exists.
   (c)   Parking Prohibited. During any snow emergency, no person shall park,
cause or permit to be parked or permit to remain parked, or abandoned or left
unattended, any vehicle of any kind or description upon any street, highway,
thoroughfare, alley or public roadway designated by the Mayor for prohibited
parking during the snow emergency. All vehicles parked prior to the time such
weather conditions prohibit parking and a snow emergency is announced shall be
removed by the owners, operators or other persons responsible for such
vehicles. Any motor vehicle parked in violation of this prohibition shall
subject the owner or operator to the penalties provided herein. It shall be the
responsibility of the owner, operator, or other person responsible for such
vehicle to ascertain whether weather conditions require the removal of this
vehicle from the streets designated and to remove all vehicles parked in
violation of the provisions set forth in this chapter.
   (d)   Notification. It shall be the responsibility of the owners or
operators of motor vehicles to ascertain whether conditions or the declared
emergency requires the removal of their vehicles from the streets or areas
designated on the Snow Emergency Location Map. In order to assist dissemination
of this information, the streets designated hereof shall be marked with pole
signs and the Mayor shall through radio, newspaper or other available media
disseminate information as the existence of a declared emergency. Once the
emergency is declared the effective time shall be no sooner than two hours
after the first announcement and such announcement shall constitute notice to
the general public of the existence of the emergency period. The Village shall

   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)    (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

909.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, other than the Service and Water and Sewer Department or
authorized employees shall make any opening in or cut into, break or otherwise
disturb any street, alley, gutter, or public right of way within the Village
unless a permit therefor is obtained, prior to the commencement of the work, as
herein provided.
(Ord. 88-12. Passed 8-15-88.)
909.02 APPLICATION; BOND DEPOSIT REQUIRED.
   Each permit for opening any public right of way shall be confined to a
single project and may be issued by the Planning and Zoning Chairperson. The
permit application shall be made on a form prescribed by the Chairperson,
giving the exact location of the proposed project, the type of existing
pavement, the area and depth to be excavated, and such other facts as may be
required. The permit shall be issued only after a cash deposit or other
approved bond, sufficient to cover the total anticipated cost of restoration of
the excavation site, has been deposited with the Planning and Zoning
Chairperson, conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory restoration of all
pavement surfaces disturbed. (Ord. 88-12. Passed 8-15-88.)
909.03 BOND DEPOSIT RATES; PUBLIC UTILITY EXCEPTION.
   No person shall dig or disturb any portion of a street or alley or public
right of way in the Village for any purpose, unless permission is obtained from
the Planning and Zoning Chairperson through a permit and a deposit is made with
the Chairperson of not less than the following amounts for streets or alleys of
the stated type of construction:
   (1)   Class “A” Street.
 
Type of Construction           Minimum Deposit Required
Concrete                       $400.00
Concrete and brick          400.00
Concrete, brick and asphalt  400.00
Full-depth asphalt (4"+)    400.00
   (2)   Class “B” Street.

more than a total of 20 square feet. For larger increments, the following
square foot amounts shall be added to above stated bonds:
 
Class “A” Str$10.00 per square foot
Class “B” Str$8.00 per square foot
   Deposits shall be predicated upon the assumption that the Village may be
required to make a satisfactory repair to the excavation and pavement in order
to properly restore the street, alley or public right of way to at least as
good of condition as it was prior to the opening. These bonds are also
predicated on the fact that the Village requires the contractor or the property
owner to properly complete all pavement restoration work. However, if the
property owner or contractor doing the work should not restore the pavement,
then the deposit would be utilized by the Village to complete the restoration.
All deposits shall be held by the Village for a period of three months after
the completion of the repair work in order to be assured that final repair work
is durable and acceptable. The Village Administrator shall inspect all work,
upon notification by the contractor or owner, to determine that proper repairs
have been made according to Village specifications.
   A public utility agrees for each project that the utility will pay for the
proper restoration of any pavement area disturbed by its operation and that it
will repair the said pavement to Village specifications and shall meet the
requirements of the Village Administrator.
   Each public utility will provide for proper safety barriers and warning
lights, as required by the most recent edition of the Ohio Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, and will specifically assume all liability for such
excavation within the public right of way.
(Ord. 88-12. Passed 8-15-88; Ord. 2009-11. Passed 7-20-09.)
909.04 RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   The opening and restoration of pavement or other surfaces shall be performed
under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the Village Administrator and
in accordance with the current rules, regulations and specifications.
   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee to satisfactorily restore the
subsurface and surface of the pavement or remove all excess materials within
the time specified in the permit or, where not specified, in a reasonable
amount of time after commencement of work, the Village may restore the
subsurface and surface without notice to the permittee. In that event, the
deposit referred to in Section
909.03 shall be deemed forfeited. Such deposit shall be paid into the
appropriate fund of the Village, except that part in excess of the actual cost
to be incurred by the Village to restore the site in the manner established by
the permit utilizing either Village personnel and equipment, or otherwise as
the Village deems appropriate. If the cost of restoration performed by the
Village or its agent should exceed the amount of such deposit, the Planning and
Zoning Chairperson shall collect the balance due from such permittee.
(Ord. 88-12. Passed 8-15-88.)
909.05 BARRIERS REQUIRED.
   Any person or firm engaged in or employing others in excavating or opening
any street, sidewalk, alley or other public right of way shall have such

925.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions apply whenever said terms appear in these rules.
   (a)   Consumer: Any person who is the ultimate user of utility services
provided by the Service Village.
   (b)   Customer: Any person or entity who enters into a contractual agreement
with the Service Village to receive or to pay for utility services provided by
the Service Village. Customers may, but need not, be consumers of the services
provided under such a contractual agreement.
   (c)   Consumer Household: Any service address in which the customer who is
contractually liable for utility services furnished to that address does not
reside.
   (d)   Customer Household: Any service address in which the customer who is
contractually liable for utility services furnished to that address resides.
   (e)   Billing Address: The address at which the customer contractually
liable for utility services furnished to a service address receives billing
from the Service Village. Billing addresses may, but need not, be the address
at which said services are received.
   (f)   Service Address: Any individual address at which utility services are
furnished a consumer or customer. The singular may include the plural. Most
service addresses will be individually metered. However, in apartment
buildings, apartment complexes, duplex apartments, etc., one meter may supply
more than one household. In such circumstances, each individual apartment is a
separate service address as that term is used herein.
   (g)   Village Administrator. The Village Administrator shall be empowered
and required (when good cause is shown) to compromise and adjust billings;
negotiate, defer and compromise disputes as to service requirements or payment
demands and to cancel disconnection and/or order reconnection. The Village
Administrator shall strive to arrange reasonable alternate methods of payment,
or reasonable security for payment, in order to preserve utility service, and
shall maintain residential utility service, without discrimination. The Village
Administrator shall preside at hearings held pursuant to these rules.
      (Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.02 UTILITY SERVICE TERMINATION POLICY.
   Utility service to customer or consumer households may be disconnected or
terminated (hereinafter “disconnection”) by the Village only for the following
reasons:
   (a)   Nonpayment;
   (b)   Emergencies, repairs and replacement of lines;
   (c)   At customer request, provided that the approval of both the customer
and consumer of services for that service address is necessary if any service
address affected by the request is a consumer.
   (d)   If, upon physical examination, the Village obtains reasonable grounds
for and has a good faith belief that, Ohio R.C. 4933.18 or 4933.19 have been
violated by use of a jumper or other by-pass mechanism:
      (1)   Prior to installation of check valves or backflow protection; or
      (2)   Which results in bypassing and negating such valves or protection.
While the Village must otherwise satisfy the requirements of these rules,
utility service may be terminated immediately upon that discovery, without
notice or opportunity for hearing prior to termination. However, in such
circumstances, if a customer or consumer household affected by such termination
thereafter requests a hearing, and establishes that the offending condition has
been remedied, utility service will be reinstated, conditioned on continuing
good behavior, although the Village does not thereby waive any right of
prosecution otherwise granted under the law.
   (e)   Nonpayment of a lien certified against the property pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 735.29(A).
   Except as set forth in (b), (d) and (e) above, disconnections other than
those with approval of both the customer and consumer of service may not occur
without proper notice and adequate opportunity for hearing before termination.
These rules shall be complied with by all utility department employees.
   No disconnection of service shall occur except after compliance with these
rules.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.03 NOTICE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Written notice of proposed disconnection of service, for any reason,
other than voluntary disconnection where the customer asking for disconnection
is also the only consumer at the address, must be sent by the Village at least
14 days, and no more than 30 days, prior to the date for proposed
disconnection. Notices may be mailed with first class postage prepaid to
reasonably assure delivery within that time. The date of the notice shall be
the date of mailing, and a dated copy of any notice sent shall be retained by
the Village. The notice shall include:
      (1)   Identifying information, including the service address to be
affected, the account number, the customer’s name and address, and the identity
and address of the Provider;
      (2)   The date proposed for disconnection if the account is not paid, or
hearing requested, or a separate account established.
   (b)   Notices shall clearly and conspicuously advise any recipient of his/
her due process rights. The notice shall be given in a termination letter which
will set forth the procedure for requesting a hearing. If a hearing is
requested, the disconnection will not take place until the hearing process is
completed.
   The notice in the termination letter shall include the following:
      (1)   The reason for disconnection or termination of service;
      (2)   The front of the envelope shall be stamped or printed in ink:
               FINAL NOTICE
               Failure to Pay Will
               Result in Shut-off
      (3)   The letter shall also include the following statements: You may
avoid termination by taking one or more of the following actions prior to the
scheduled termination date:
         A.   If you personally owe utility service charges which are past due,
you should pay the bill in full or make arrangements to pay which are
satisfactory to the Village of Ashville.
         B.   If you dispute the reason for the proposed termination, in whole
or part, you may request a hearing to contest termination. If a hearing is
requested before the scheduled date for termination, termination will not take
place until the hearing process is complete. If you request a hearing, you have
the right to examine records concerning this service address; to bring a
representative to help you at the hearing; and to bring witnesses to testify on
your behalf; or
         C.   If you are a residential user of utility service at the address
to be terminated, and if the customer responsible for paying the utility bill
does not live at your address, you may avoid termination by paying a $75.00
deposit and agreeing to contract for your own utility usage in the future.
   If you wish to avoid termination, or to request a hearing, or wish a more
complete explanation of your hearing rights or your rights to assume
responsibility for future utility charges, you should immediately contact the
Ashville Village Administrator at the address and telephone number listed on
this card between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday, through Friday.
               FINAL NOTICE
   IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES ABOUT THIS BILL, CALL THE VILLAGE OF
ASHVILLE.
   
   In the event any service address that would be affected by disconnection is
a consumer household, notice of disconnection of service, in this form and
manner, must be delivered to each service address so affected, in addition to
delivery to the customer household.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.04 DISCONNECTION.
   Pursuant to the provisions in Sections
925.02  and
925.03 , if water service to a household is disconnected or terminated, and no
hearing has been requested, at the time of disconnection a “Notice of
Termination of Utility Service” will be left on the property by a Village of
Ashville representative. A copy of the Notice is designated hereto as Exhibit
3. If disconnection or termination is due to the consumer or customer failing
to prevail in a hearing, the termination notice will not be left at the
property and service will only be restored by the payment due as determined by
the hearing.
   If, after a copy of the Exhibit 3 disconnection notice is left on the
property in a conspicuous place (at the front door if possible), the customer
or consumer believes a mistake has been made and that the water service should
not have been disconnected, the customer or consumer may contact the Village of
Ashville. After receiving the complaint, the Village Administrator shall
reconnect the water service only if he/she believes, after reasonable inquiry,
that a mistake has been made as to the following:
   (a)   The customer/consumer has not been mailed the final termination
notice; or
   (b)   The customer/consumer has arranged a payment plan with the Village
Administrator which superseded the final termination notice.
   In the case of (a) above, water service shall be reconnected and the final
termination notice provided to the customer/consumer. In the case of (b) above,
water service shall be reconnected and a final termination notice sent to the
customer/consumer if the person fails to make payment under the alternative
payment plan agreed to. If the Village Administrator determines that a mistake
has not been made as to the disconnection, that fact shall be communicated to
the customer/consumer, and the Village Administrator shall also communicate to
the customer/consumer that he/she has the right to a hearing.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.05 EMERGENCIES AND REPAIRS.
   Disconnection of service may occur without prior notice if emergency
circumstances involve imminent danger to persons or property, including a break
in a utility service line. Prior notice shall be given by the Village where
utility service shall be lost for more than eight hours as the result of
routine or scheduled maintenance, so that consumers of utility service may plan
accordingly. If the loss of utility service results from a utility line break
or other emergency circumstances, and is expected to, or does, last for more
than four hours, the Village shall make reasonable attempts to give notice to
service addresses affected by such loss of service by asking local media and
using public bulletin boards to publicize the loss of service, the reason for
it, and the expected date and time by which the Village expects to restore
service.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.06 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   Upon receiving a request for voluntary disconnection, if the Village’s
records reveal that the service address is different from the billing address
for that account, or if there is other reason to believe disconnection may
affect a service address comprised of a household other than, or in addition
to, the customer’s household, the Village shall:
   (a)   Send a copy of any final notice to the service address; and
   (b)   Send a copy of any customer’s voluntary termination of water service
notice to the service address.
   A customer requesting a voluntary disconnection must complete the form
designated as Exhibit 1.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.07 HEARING PROCEDURES.
   Persons who wish to contest a denial of utility service, or the Village’s
decision as to billing or a proposed disconnection of utility services
(hereafter “the person”) shall be afforded a due process opportunity to contest
the Provider’s action or inaction prior to termination of service. Due process
opportunity is the right to a face-to-face meeting with the Village
Administrator, at which time a person may:
   (a)   Have the assistance of a representative; and
   (b)   May present documentary and/or oral information and/or the testimony
of witnesses for the Village Administrator’s consideration.
   These persons shall be entitled to reasonable access to the Village’s
business records concerning the affected service address in order to prepare
for the meeting, which right of access includes the right to obtain copies of
documents found therein upon payment of the actual cost of copying. The Village
Administrator shall make a written decision after the hearing and the reasons
for the decision. A copy of the decision shall be delivered to the person; a
copy shall be retained in a special decisions file; and a copy retained in the
business files kept by the Village relating to any service address affected by
the hearing.
   Due process hearings shall be held within a reasonable time after a verbal
or written hearing request has been made, but will not be held so quickly as to
deny the person an adequate opportunity to seek assistance or to prepare for
the hearing, in light of the person’s circumstances. The hearing decision shall
be sent to the person within a reasonable time after the hearing. If a hearing
has been requested prior to actual disconnection of service, no disconnection
may occur until five days after the hearing decision is delivered to the person
who requested the hearing.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.08 NONDISCRIMINATION AGAINST CONSUMERS.
   If service is disconnected, or if disconnection is proposed, due to a
customer’s nonpayment of service charges for a consumer household, an adult
consumer of utility services in said household shall have the right to avoid
disconnection, or obtain reconnection, if the consumer pays a $75.00 deposit
and assumes written responsibility for timely payment of future charges for
service provided the household at the service address. Consumer assumption does
not relieve the customer of contractual liability for charges incurred. The
assumption obligation shall terminate upon the consumer’s delivery to the
Village of a written notice canceling that assumption, and the deposit shall be
returned if the consumer makes payment of the consumer’s final bill in full. If
the consumer does not pay the final bill in full, said final bill amount (or
portion unpaid) will be deducted from the deposit and any deposit balance will
be returned to the consumer.
   This section does not apply to any customer concerning any service address
in which resides the customer obligated for payment of the account for that
service address. However, in circumstances in which one meter serves more than
one service address, consumer households will not be penalized in any way, or
denied the benefit of this provision, because the defaulting customer’s
benefited unit might also benefit from a continuation or restoration of
service.
   The Village shall not refuse to furnish utility service and/or propose to or
disconnect utility service to any customer or consumer household on account of
arrearages due Village for utility services furnished to persons formerly
receiving services at the same premises, provided the customers obligated on
that delinquent account do not continue to reside at such premises. Applicants
who are denied utility service shall be notified of that decision, and the
reason for it, by use of the form attached as Exhibit 2, at the time of the
denial. No consumer of utility may be denied services because of, or billed for
or required to pay for utility services furnished on the account of another
individual, except to the extent of any assumption obligation previously
assumed by that consumer pursuant to this paragraph, except that nothing herein
affects the rights of the Village to lien property as provided by law,
including but not limited to the procedures of Ohio R.C. 735.29(A) for
certifying past due water bills to the County Auditor for collection.
(Ord. 94-1. Passed 2-7-94.)
925.09 ADDITIONAL METHOD OF COMMUNICATION UNDER THE NOTICE PROCEDURES AND
DISCONNECTION.
   (a)   The invoice generated by the Utility Information System is recognized
as communication under Section
925.03  and 
925.04  for Consumers and Customers of our utility services.
   (b)   The invoice generated in subsection (a) hereof must contain all
information required in
925.03 and
925.04 to be used in lieu of a formal letter specified in Section
925.03(b), “termination letter”. (Ord. 2009-10. Passed 7-20-09.)

Notice of Termination of Utility Service
 
You are notified that utility service to:
                                                                                          (service address)
was terminated at         a.m./p.m. on the        day of               , 20     , because of:
                                                                                                               
(reason for termination)

and you pay a restoral fee of $                         .
You have a right to a hearing if you believe termination was wrong. Requesting a hearing at this time will not result in restoring service unless you win the hearing. However, if you believe this termination is a mistake
in that you have not been previously mailed a final termination notice  or you have already entered into a payment plan with Ashville, you should contact the Village Administrator immediately who may decide to reconnect
your water service without the necessity of a hearing.
If termination was for nonpayment of a utility bill by a customer who does not reside at the service address, an adult resident of the service address may be able to temporarily obtain utility service in their own name
until the customer pays the back bills. If you obtain utility service in your own name, you must pay a deposit and agree to pay any charges that will be incurred while the bill is in your name. However, you will not be
required to pay the customer’s back bill.
   If you:
   
   *   wish to request a hearing;
   *   wish to learn your rights concerning the hearing process;
   *   wish to arrange for utility service reconnection;

929.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to
the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the Village, to operate
the water and sewerage systems of the Village as a public utility and to levy
and collect water and sewer service charges upon all lots, land and premises
served by having connections with the system, and such charges when collected
shall be used for the purposes hereinafter provided.
   (b)   For the purposes of this chapter, the terms are defined as follows:
      (1)   “Sewage” means the water or water-borne wastes from premises on
which any structure has been erected having connection with the system.
      (2)   “Industrial wastes” means the liquid waste resulting from any
commercial, manufacturing or industrial operations or processes.
      (3)   “Tap” means the connection to the water main and the necessary
pipes or lines extending from the water main to and including the curb stop or
valve and box. Tap is also defined as the connection to the sanitary sewer main
including wye branch or saddle as appropriate.
      (4)   “Water service outside Village” means water service furnished to
consumers outside the corporate limits of Ashville in accordance with authority
for the service previously granted by the Council of this Village.
         (Ord. 93-12. Passed 9-20-93.)
929.02 WATER RATES.
   (a)   The 2016 rate of $6.99 charge (rate) will be applied in thousand
gallon increments to all quantities.
   (b)   The $6.99 charge will be increased by a factor of 100% for all
wastewater service outside Village which means wastewater service furnished to
consumers outside the corporate limits of Ashville in accordance with authority
for the service previously granted by Council.
(Ord. 2016-07. Passed 7-26-16.)
929.03 WATER METERS AND WATER TAPS.
   When an application for initial water service or a change in water service
is approved, the meter shall be installed by the Village and the fee charged
shall be equal to the cost shown in the Water and Sewer Regulations.
   All water meters shall be maintained by and remain the property of the
Village.
   All water taps in subdivisions or developments must be installed at the time
the water mains are installed.
   Every property owner shall be required to install a tap for each lot or
parcel immediately prior to the paving of any street.
   Taps may be installed by a qualified contractor upon issuance of a permit by
the Water Department. Such installation must conform to the standards and
specifications of the Water Department and must be approved by the Water
Department.
(Ord. 93-12. Passed 9-20-93.)
929.04 BILLING, METER READING, TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)   Billing. The Village will render bills for water and sewer service on
a monthly basis.
   (b)   Meter Reading. All meter readings and billings shall be in units of
1,000 gallons. Each water meter within a multi-unit structure or an apartment
building shall be individually read by the Village employees or its designee.
   (c)   Terms of Payment. The water rates prescribed above are net. If
accounts are not paid by the 15th of the month following the monthly billing, a
gross rate, which is the net rate plus 10 percent (10%) shall be charged.
(Ord. 2001-33. Passed 12-3-01.)
929.05 SEWER RATES.
   (a)   “Sewer rates” are established by considering factors, including the
following: the customer base, the gallons billed in the past and anticipated to
be billed in the future, the operational costs in the past and anticipated to
be sustained in the future, the maintenance and repair costs in the past and
anticipated to be sustained in the future, and past and future debt service.
   (b)   In the event the water passing to any such sewer connections arrives
from a source other than the Municipal Water Works System, the amount of water
so used may be otherwise measured and determined by the Village Administrator
in order to determine the sewer service charge.
   (c)   In the event that the Village Administrator shall be satisfied that a
portion of the water from any source consumed upon any premises does not and
cannot enter the sanitary sewerage system, the owner or other interested party
may, at his expense, install and maintain such separate metering devices. A
portion of the water so consumed which is not discharged into the system shall
be billed for water only.
   (d)   Over and above the rates and charges hereinabove established, there
may be established in special instances and upon special agreement between the
Village and the owner of any premises served by the sanitary sewerage system,
such additional charges for industrial wastes of unusual strength or
composition which were accepted by the Village for treatment as may be
determined to be fair and equitable. Each such special agreement and the
charges established thereby shall not be effective until ratified by ordinance
duly passed by Council of the Village.
   (e)   For all premises within the Village using the sanitary sewer system
only, a minimum monthly user fee of $30.00 will be charged. For all premises
outside the Village, $45.00 per month shall be charged for the minimum user
fee. (Ord. 2000-16. Passed 8-7-00.)

929.08 STORMWATER RATES.
   (a)   “Stormwater rates” are established by considering factors, including
the customer base, the amount billed, and anticipated to be billed in the
future, the operational costs and anticipated to be sustained in the future,
the maintenance and repair costs in the past and anticipated to be sustained in
the future, and past and future debt service.
   (b)   Stormwater utility fees provide a comprehensive stormwater management
program that includes a capital improvement program to address neighborhood and
street flooding, maintenance of existing stormwater infrastructure and programs
to water quality protection programs to ensure compliance with Ohio EPA
regulations. The rates are based on a property’s contribution to stormwater
runoff and are categorized by residential and non-residential land use.
Customers are charged based on the impervious (non-penetrable) area a property
is known to have, such as pavement and rooftops. A billing unit, called an
Equivalent Residential Unit (or ERU) is equal to 2000 square feet of impervious
area. Even properties that do not have a storm sewer, or water or sanitary
sewer service, will receive a stormwater bill. This is because all properties
with impervious surface contribution to an area’s stormwater runoff. The entire
community benefits from proper stormwater management.
   Stormwater charges for single-family residential properties:
   All single-family residential properties are calculated at 1 ERU and are
billed the same flat daily rate. An example of how the 2006 residential rate is
calculated:
$0.0987 per day x 30 days = $2.961 x 1 ERU = $2.961
   Stormwater charges for non-residential properties:
   Non-residential properties are calculated by how much impervious area the
property is nown to have, which was compiled from the Village’s Geographical
Information System (GIS) and other records. A property with 10,000 square feet
of impervious area would be billed at 5 ERUs (10,000 divided by 2000). For
example:
   $.0987 x 30 days = $2.9618.883 x 10 ERUs = $29.61. The stormwater fee for
non- residential properties varies by the number of days in the billing period
and the number of ERUs calculated for the property.
   For questions about stormwater charges for a particular Ashville property,
please call our office at 740/983-6367. (Ord. 2006-14. Passed 11-20-06.)

935.01 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL; GENERAL POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water systems.
   (b)   Application. These Rules and Regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water system of the Village of Ashville.
   (c)   Policy. The Village Administrator or his or her designated
representative shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable
water system from contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the
water service connection. If, in the judgement of the Village Administrator or
his or her designated representative, an approved backflow prevention device is
necessary at the water service connection to any consumer's premises for the
safety of the water system, the Village Administrator or his or her designated
representative shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved
backflow prevention device at each service connection to his premises. The
consumer shall immediately install such approved device or devices at his own
expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to
install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have
been installed.

(collectively, “properties”) situated within the corporate limits of the
Village, that is tributary directly or indirectly to the stormwater system,
Utility service charges determined as provided in this section.
   All properties having impervious area within the Village shall be assigned
an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, which will be at a
minimum one ERU.
   All improved single-family residential properties are assigned one ERU. A
flat rate will apply to all single-family residential properties. All improved
single-family residential properties are determined to include impervious area
typical of a single-family residence.
   All properties having an impervious area which are not improved single-
family residential properties are to be assigned by the Village Administrator
an ERU multiple based upon the properties’ estimated impervious area (in square
feet) divided by 2,530 square feet (one ERU). This division will be calculated
to the second decimal place and rounded according to mathematical convention to
the nearest whole ERU.
   The Stormwater Utility service charge will be found in Title Three Chapter

943.03   Reuse of existing connection for new building.
943.04   Point of sale removal.
943.01 STORMWATER CONNECTIONS TO SANITARY.
   Except as otherwise expressly authorized in this code, no water from any
roof surface, sump pump, footing tile, foundation drains, rain leaders,
swimming pool, any other natural precipitation, cooling water or industrial
process water shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and
other buildings and structures which require sump pumps or footing tiles shall
have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time
discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided herein. A
permanent installation shall be one which provides for year round discharge
capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure, or is
connected to a village storm sewer. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line,
without valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge or a
system otherwise approved by the Wastewater and Service Departments of the
Village of Ashville.
   (a)    Any person, firm or corporation having a roof surface, sump pump,
footing tile, foundation drains, rain leaders, swimming pool, any other natural
precipitation, cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water now
connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall disconnect or
remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer system shall be
dosed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner.
   (b)    Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the
Village's sanitary sewer system shall allow the Village or a designated
representative of the Village to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is
no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. In
lieu of having the Village inspect the property, any person may furnish a
village inspection report from a Village approved licensed plumber certifying
that the property is in compliance with this section.
   (c)    Any property with a sump pump found not in compliance with this
subdivision but subsequently verified as compliant shall be subject to an
annual reinspection to confirm continued compliance. Any property found not to
be in compliance upon reinspection, or any persons refusing to allow their
property to be reinspected, within thirty (30) days after receipt of mailed
written notice from the Village of the reinspection, shall be subject to the
nonrefundable charge set forth in subsection (e) below.
   (d)    All new dwellings with sumps for which a building permit is issued
shall have a pump and shall be piped to the outside of the dwelling before a
certificate of occupancy is issued.
   (e)    A nonrefundable fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month is
hereby imposed on every sewer bill mailed to property owners who are not in
compliance with this section or who have refused to allow their property to be
inspected to determine if there is compliance. All properties found during any
reinspection to have violated this subdivision will be subject to a one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per month nonrefundable charge for all months between the two
most recent inspections in addition to all other regular charges for sanitary
sewer service.
   (f)    The Village Administrator or designee is authorized to issue a permit
to allow a property owner to discharge water into the sanitary sewer system.
Prior to issuance of the permit, the Village Administrator may consult with an
engineer and/or Wastewater and/or Service Departments to verify one of the
criteria to issue the permit has been satisfied. The permit shall authorize
such discharge only from November 15 to March 15, shall require the owner to
permit an inspection of the property on March 16 or as soon thereafter as
possible to determine that discharge into the sanitary sewer has been
discontinued and shall subject the owner to the one hundred dollars ($100.00)
monthly nonrefundable charge in the event the owner refuses an inspection or
has failed to discontinue the discharge into the sanitary sewer. The
nonrefundable charge will commence with the April water billing and continue
until the property owner establishes compliance with this section. A property
owner is required to meet at least one of the following criteria in order to
obtain the permit:
      (1)   The freezing of the surface water discharge from the sump pump or
footing drain is causing a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or
flooding, on either public or private property.
      (2)   The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that the
sump pump or footing drain pipes will freeze up and result in either failure or
damage to the sump pump unit or the footing drain and cause basement flooding.
      (3)   The water being discharged from the sump pump or footing drain
cannot be readily discharged into a storm drain or other acceptable drainage
system.
      Following ten (10) day's written notice and an opportunity to be heard,
the village administrator may require the owners of property to discharge their
sump pump into the sanitary sewer from November 15 to March 15 if surface water
discharge is causing an icy condition on streets.
   (g)   Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public
sewer:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees
Fahrenheit.
      (2)   Any water or waste which may contain more than 100 parts per
million by weight, of fact, oil, or grease.
      (3)   Any gasoline, benzene, naptha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid or gas.
         (Ord. 2020-04. Passed 7-6-20.)
943.02 SANITARY CONNECTIONS TO STORMWATER.
   (a)   The Village of Ashville has adopted a number of practices that are
aimed at protecting the quality of water resources within Ashville and the
integrity of the sanitary sewer system. These practices are crucial to the
future performance and investment required by the utility system because they
represent the manner in which this and previous sanitary sewer plans are
implemented.
   (b)   The sanitary sewer ordinance requires that properties where domestic
or industrial wastewater is produced be connected to the public sanitary sewer
system within two (2) years of service availability. Further, the ordinance
prescribes the design and manner in which individual connections and use of
public sewers are to be made. To limit the amount of inflow into the sanitary
sewer system, the ordinance prohibits the flows of storm water, ground water,
roof runoff, surface water, unpolluted drainage, unpolluted industrial cooling
water, or unpolluted industrial process water into any public sanitary sewer.
(Ord. 2020-04. Passed 7-6-20.)
943.03 REUSE OF EXISTING CONNECTION FOR NEW BUILDING.
   (a)   Where a building having a connection to the public sewer has been torn
down and a new building is being constructed in its place, the abandoned house
drain connection that served the previous building may be used, PROVIDING IT
MEETS ALL THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT OF A NEW CONNECTION, with the exception that
the pipe depth must be at least six (6) feet measured to the top of pipe at the
property line. If the owner elects to use the old connection, a regular permit
must be taken out for such connection of the new building. The line must be
flushed and televised (and reviewed by the Wastewater Department-Utility),
prior to use, at the contractor's cost. Services over fifty (50) years old
cannot be reused except at the discretion of the Utility. If approved, the
house Sewer Contractor must inform the property owner that they have ownership
and are responsible for the re-used pipe.
   (b)   When reusing an abandoned sand rock drift, the new drill hole is to be
constructed in front of the old drill hole, a bulkhead must be of similar
construction as used for abandoning sand rock drifts. (Ord. 2020-04. Passed 7-
6-20.)
943.04 POINT OF SALE REMOVAL.
   As an existing home within the Village is sold, the Village will administer
an ongoing plan requiring an inspection of the plumbing system. If either sump
pumps or passive drain tile are found that discharge clear water to the
sanitary sewer system, their discharge will be routed away from the sanitary
sewer.

an application by at least one (l) owner or lessee of the property, or their
designated agent, said proposed amendment or application shall be transmitted
to the Planning and Zoning Board.
1115.05 RECOMMENDATION BY PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD.
   Within sixty (60) days after the first regular meeting of the Planning and
Zoning Board after the receipt of the proposed amendment, the Planning and
Zoning Board may recommend to the Village Council that the amendment be
approved as requested, approved with modification, or it may recommend that the
amendment be denied. A public hearing may be held by the Planning and Zoning
Board for consideration of the proposed amendment. If such a hearing is held,
the Planning and Zoning Board shall follow the same requirements for
notification as specified in Section
1115.06 below.
1115.06 ACTION BY VILLAGE COUNCIL.
   (a)   Public Hearing. Before the proposed Ordinance may be passed, the
Village Council shall hold a public hearing, and shall give at least thirty
(30) days notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village. If the proposed Ordinance intends to remove or
redistrict ten (10) or less parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate,
written notice of the hearing shall be made by the Village Fiscal Officer, by
first-class mail, at least twenty (20) days before the date of the public
hearing to the owners of property within 200 feet or contiguous to, and
directly across the street from such parcel or parcels to be redistricted to
the address of such owners appearing on the Pickaway County Auditor's current
tax list, as provided by the applicant. The failure of delivery of such notice
shall not invalidate such proposed Ordinance.
   (b)   Display of Relevant Materials. During such thirty (30) days, the text
or copy of the text of the proposed Ordinance, together with maps, plans, and
reports submitted by the Planning and Zoning Board shall be on file, for public
examination, in the office of the Village Fiscal Officer.
   (c)   Action by Village Council. No such Ordinance which is in accordance
with the recommendation submitted by the Planning and Zoning Board shall be
deemed to pass or take effect without the concurrence of at least a majority of
the membership of the Village Council. No such Ordinance which violates,
differs from, or departs from the recommendation submitted by the Planning and
Zoning Board shall take effect unless passed or approved by not less than
three- fourths (3/4) of the membership of the Village Council.
   (d)   Criteria. In reviewing the proposed amendment and arriving at its
decision, the Village Council shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   Compatibility of the proposed amendment with the zoning and use of
adjacent land, and with land use plans for the general area.
      (2)   The effect of the adoption of the proposed amendment on motor
vehicle access, traffic flow, and the provision of public services in the
general area.
      (3)   The effect of the adoption of the proposed amendment upon the
public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Village.
         (Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1115.07 EFFECTIVE DATE AND REFERENDUM.
   Such amendment adopted by Village Council shall become effective thirty (30)
days after the date of Ordinance, subject to the provisions for referendum
specified in the Ohio Revised Code. If the amendment as passed by Village
Council pertains to a change in the Official Zoning Map, such change shall be
incorporated onto the Map by reference to the Ordinance Number and date of
adoption.

1117.01 APPEALS.
   (a)   Taking of Appeals. Appeals to the Planning and Zoning Board concerning
interpretation or administration of this Ordinance by the Zoning Inspector may
be taken by any person aggrieved, including a tenant, or by a governmental
officer, department, or board. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30)
days after the date of the decision, by filing with the Zoning Inspector or
with the Planning and Zoning Board, a notice of appeal specifying the decision
of the Zoning Inspector which the appeal is being taken.
   (b)   Imminent Peril. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector certifies to the Planning
and Zoning Board, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that
by reason of facts stated in the application a stay would, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may, on due cause shown, be
granted by the Planning and Zoning Board after notice to the Zoning Inspector,
or by judicial proceedings.
1117.02 POWERS OF THE PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD.
   The Planning and Zoning Board shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, as hereinafter provided, such variances from the provisions
or requirements of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship that
would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and buildings
involved. No variance from strict application of any provision of this
Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that all the following
facts and conditions exist:
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such necessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public health, safety and/or
welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
1117.03 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE AND APPEALS.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning permit, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from the
decision of the Zoning Inspector. The application for an appeal or variance may
be obtained from the Zoning Inspector, or from the Village Fiscal Officer, and
shall contain the information specified in Appendix A. The application shall be
filed in triplicate with the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning Inspector shall
forward a copy of the application to the Planning and Zoning Board within five
(5) working days from receipt of the completed application.
1117.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Planning and Zoning Board may
prescribe appropriate and reasonable conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section
1121.99  of this Ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the Planning and
Zoning Board grant an appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under
the terms of this Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or
by implication prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district.
1117.05 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
   The Planning and Zoning Board shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of an application for an appeal or variance from the Zoning
Inspector or an applicant.
1117.06 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Before holding the public hearing pursuant to Section
1117.05 , notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the Village at least ten (10) days before the date of
said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public
hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.
1117.07 NOTICE TO PARTIES OF INTEREST.
   Before holding the public hearing pursuant to Section
1117.05, written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the Village Fiscal
Officer, by first-class mail, at least ten (10) days before the day of the
hearing to all parties of interest. The notice shall contain the same
information as required of notice published in newspapers as specified in
Section
1117.06. Parties of interest shall include at a minimum, owners and occupants
of property within 200 feet from, contiguous to, and directly across the street
from the property being considered. Failure of delivery of such notice shall
not invalidate the actions of the Planning and Zoning Board.
1117.08 ACTION BY PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD.
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing pursuant to Section
1117.05, the Planning and Zoning Board shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1117.04, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Planning and
Zoning Board shall transmit a written copy of its decision and findings to the
Zoning Inspector, who shall forward such copy to the applicant. If the
application is approved, or approved with supplementary conditions, the
Planning and Zoning Board shall make a finding that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance that will make possible a
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   If the request for appeal or variance is denied, the applicant may seek
relief through the Court of Common Pleas.

1107.02
 
 
1119.01 PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances, a proposed use which more intensely
affects an area than those uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is
located, may nonetheless be desirable and compatible with permitted uses, if
that use is properly controlled and regulated. Such uses shall be listed as
conditional uses within the description of the respective zoning districts. The
Planning and Zoning Board may allow such a use to be established as a
conditional use where these unusual circumstances exist and where the proposed
use will be consistent with the general purpose and intent of this Planning and
Zoning Code.
1119.02 APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an application
to use such property for one or more of the conditional uses provided for by
this Ordinance in the zoning district in which the property is situated. An
application for a conditional use shall contain the information specified in
Appendix A, and shall be filed in triplicate with the Zoning Inspector, who
shall forward within five (5) working days a copy to the members of the
Planning and Zoning Board.
1119.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Board shall not approve a conditional use unless it shall, in each
specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based on the particular
evidence presented to it, that support conclusions that such use at the
proposed location shall meet all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives,
or with any specific objective or purpose of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Will be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the general character of
such area.
   (c)   Seeks to maintain and will not be hazardous to the health, safety and
welfare of the existing neighboring, and the total community.
   (d)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   (e)   Will not create excessive additional requirements for public
facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of
the community.
   (f)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors.
   (g)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designated as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.
1119.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with this Ordinance.
1119.05 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD.
   The Board may hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days from the receipt
of the application specified in Section
1119.02 . The requirements for public notice and notification of parties of
interest shall be the same as for appeals and variances as specified in Section
1117.06  and
1117.07 .
1119.06 ACTION BY PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD.
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing pursuant to Section
1119.05 , or within thirty (30) days from the date of the application if such
hearing is not held, the Board shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions as specified in Section
1119.04 , or disapprove the application as presented. If the application is
approved with supplementary conditions, the Board shall direct the Zoning
Inspector to issue a zoning permit listing the specific conditions listed by
the Board for approval. If the application is disapproved, the applicant may
seek relief through the Court of Common Pleas.
1119.07 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION OF ZONING PERMIT ISSUED UNDER CONDITIONAL USE
PROVISIONS.
   The approval of the zoning permit issued in accordance with Section
1119.06  shall become null and void if such use is not carried out within one
(1) year after date of approval; however, the Planning and Zoning Board may
grant an extension of a zoning permit for a conditional use for an additional
period of six (6) months. The Village may revoke the zoning permit upon written
evidence by any residents or official of the Village of violation of this
Ordinance and/or written terms and conditions upon which approval was based.

1121.01 VIOLATIONS.   
   (a)   Failure to Obtain a Required Permit or Approval. Failure to obtain a
zoning permit, Certificate of Zoning Compliance, or other approval as required
by specific Sections of this Ordinance shall be a violation of this Ordinance
and punishable under Section
1121.99 .
   (b)   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Applications, Plans,
Permits, and Certificates. Zoning permits or other approvals issued on the
basis of plans, plats and/or applications authorize only the use, and
arrangement set forth in such approved plans and applications or amendments
thereto. Any use, arrangement, or construction not in conformance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance, and punishable as
provided in Section
1121.99 .
   (c)   Complaints Regarding Violations. Whenever a violation of this
Ordinance is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint.
Such complaint shall state fully the causes and basis thereof, and shall be
filed with the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning Inspector shall record properly
such complaint, immediately investigate, and take such appropriate action
thereon as may be necessary and provided for by this Ordinance.
1121.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of any provision of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any
of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in various sections of this Ordinance) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Ordinance or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Each day such violation continues, after
receipt of violation notice, shall be considered a separate offense. The owner
or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any
architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found
guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the Village from such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violations.
     Penalties as above shall apply unless penalties are defined for specific
Sections of this Ordinance, in which case the penalties so defined in those
sections shall apply.

1171.07
 
 
1123.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by Title Three of this Ordinance, or
amendments hereinafter adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land
and structure which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended,
but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit
such nonconformities to continue until they are removed and to allow reasonable
expansion, but not to encourage their survival.
 
1123.02 WHEN PERMITTED.
   (a)   Existing Land or Buildings. Any use of land or buildings existing on
the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, even though such use
does not conform to the provisions herein, so long as such building or use was
legally existing prior to the establishment of this Ordinance. No nonconforming
building, structure, or use shall be moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed,
or structurally altered, except as provided in this Ordinance.
   (b)   Construction Commenced. Any property purchased or acquired in good
faith for any nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, upon
which property the work of changing, remodeling or construction of such
nonconforming use has been legally commenced at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance, may be used for the nonconforming use for which such changing,
remodeling or construction was undertaken, provided that such work is completed
within two (2) years from the date of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment
thereto making said use nonconforming.
1123.03 SUBSTITUTION.
   The Planning and Zoning Board may allow the nonconforming use of a building
or structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a
more restricted classification, provided no structural alterations except those
required by law or ordinance are made. However, in an "R" District, no change
shall be authorized by the Planning and Zoning Board to any use which is not a
permitted or conditional use in any "R" District.
1123.04 EXTENSION.
   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, except as follows:
   (a)   The extension of a nonconforming building on the lot occupied by such
building, or onto an adjacent lot if such lot is owned by the same person or
persons, may be permitted on a once-only basis by the Planning and Zoning
Board, provided that such extension is necessary and incidental to such
existing nonconforming use; that the extension will not increase the ground
floor area of the building by more than twenty-five percent (25%); and that
such extension will not extend the building more than twenty-five (25) feet in
any direction from the existing building outline.
   (b)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
   (c)   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a non-residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered provided it meets the requirements of the
adjacent or most proximate R-District.
1123.05 DISCONTINUANCE.
   A nonconforming use which has been discontinued or abandoned shall not
thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be
considered abandoned whenever either of the following conditions exist:
   (a)   When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of two (2)
years.
   (b)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
1123.06 DAMAGE AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR USE.
   When a building or structure, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, public enemy or
act of God, it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such nonconforming
use, provided that the restoration or rebuilding is commenced within six (6)
months of the time of damage, that construction is completed within eighteen
(18) months, and that such restoration or rebuilding would not extend or expand
the existing use, except as may be permitted in Section 
1123.04  above.
(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1123.07 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and
repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use when at least one of the following conditions exist:
   (a)   When required by law.
   (b)   To convert to a conforming use.
   (c)   A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses may
be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height requirements or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.
1123.08 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet frontage on a public right-of-way; and
further provided the following conditions are complied with:
   (a)   If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property and did not
own such property at the time this Ordinance became effective, two (2) inches
may be deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four (4)
inches from the required sum of minimum widths of both side yards for each foot
that the lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than three (3) feet.
   (b)   If the owner of such lot owns two (2) or more adjacent lots, or other
adjacent property, such owner shall redivide the property in such a manner that
they conform to the minimum width of such lots in the most proximate single-
family district. However, if such redivision would result in lots that exceed
width requirement of lots in the most proximate district, such redivision shall
provide for one (1) more building lot than would otherwise be allowed.

1131.01 REGULATION OF THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures, and the
physical development thereof within each of the zoning districts as established
in Chapter 1133, are hereby established and adopted.
1131.02 RULES OF APPLICATION.
   (a)   Identification of Uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this Ordinance.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.  
      (1)   Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as a matter of
right in any zoning district, and any use not so designated shall be prohibited
unless:
         A.   A permitted use may be added to a zoning district by formal
amendment, in conformance with Chapter
1111 of this Ordinance.
         B.   An unlisted use may be determined by the Planning and Zoning
Board to be a similar use, in accordance with subsection (e) hereof.
      (2)   No more than one (1) permitted use shall exist on any one zoning
lot.
   (c)   Accessory Uses. An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use or
structure clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted building
or use, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use.
Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in accordance with the specific
district regulations, and the requirements of Chapter
1175 of this Ordinance.
   (d)   Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Planning and Zoning Board shall, in addition
to the development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with Chapter
1119 of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Similar Uses. Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses
permitted by right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of
the district and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use
found similar shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that
district.
   Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in the
permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this Section,
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Board.
   Within thirty (30) days after such submittal, the Planning and Zoning Board
shall determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses permitted in
the specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the Planning and
Zoning Board shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in another
zoning district.
      (2)   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the classification to
which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other
classification.
      (3)   Such use creates no danger to health and safety, creates no
offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other
objectionable influences, and does not create traffic congestion to an extent
greater than that normally resulting from uses listed in the classification to
which it is to be added.
   (f)   Development Standards. Development standards set forth shall be the
minimum allowed for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
 
   (g)   Development Plan. For particular uses in specific districts, a
Development Plan will be cited as required. In such cases, the Development Plan
shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of the application for a zoning
permit, or at such time when the property is rezoned into that district. The
Development Plan shall contain a site plan for the property, drawn to
approximate scale, showing all property lines, existing buildings, access
drives, parking areas, and other notable physical features. The Development
Plan shall also show the location, outlines and size of all proposed structures
including the design of all improvements including drainage, private streets,
water and sanitary sewer lines, as well as the size, design, materials and
location of all signage proposed for the development. The Development Plan
shall also contain a narrative description of the proposed use, and an
evaluation of how such use may impact adjacent property.
   The Owner/Developer shall provide evidence in the Development Plan that all
storm drainage in the development shall be addressed in conformance with the
“Stormwater Design Manual” (Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission; June, 1977)
as may be subsequently amended.

1161.01 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Ashville contains areas with rich historic, architectural
and/or environmental character. The preservation of these areas is directly
linked to the economic, social, historical and cultural health and well-being
of the community. The purpose of the Design Review District is to protect and
preserve these assets and to prevent intrusions and alterations within the

development that respects the context of the existing built environment, to
promote local design qualities, to stabilize and enhance property values, and
to reduce conflicts between new construction and existing development.
   The Design Review District is an Overlay District. This means that the
standards of this chapter are requirements which must be met in addition to the
established requirements and standards of the base district over which the

design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other
structure including the type and texture of the light fixtures, signs and other
appurtenant fixtures. In the case of an outdoor advertising sign, "exterior

(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1161.07 CRITERIA OF EVALUATION OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATION OF DESIGN
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed environmental change,
including landscaping or exterior signage, the Design Review Board shall
consider the following:
   (a)   The visual and functional components of the building and its site,
including but not limited to, building height, massing and proportion, roof
shape and slope, landscape design and plant materials, lighting, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, and signage.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental features should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or
placement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of
the feature, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (i)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired. Additions to the least significant and least visible of historic
properties should be given priority over other designs. (Ord. 2000-14. Passed
7-24-00.)
1161.08 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Existing Structures and Premises. Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Design Review District shall conform to the distinguishing, original
exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site, and its
environment.
   (b)   New Construction. The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises within the individual precinct.
   (c)   Materials. All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of
existing structures within the Design Review District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and/or wood. The
use of contemporary materials, such as aluminum and other similar metals,
fiberglass and plastic for exterior surfaces on architecturally significant
structures shall be prohibited unless the use of such materials would
contribute to the enhancement of existing traditional materials and the overall
integrity and longevity of the structure.
   (d)   Color. Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that are
both identified with the origin or the era in which the structure of property
was originally built, shall be used for exteriors for all new structures to be
built, and reconstruction, remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing
structures within the Design Review District.
   (e)   Signs. All signs within the Design Review District shall conform to

1163.01 FINDING OF FACT.
   Specific areas of the Village of Ashville adjacent to Walnut Creek are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
hazards to health and safety, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These
losses are caused - to a significant degree - by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodways (causing increased flood heights and velocities in
upstream areas), and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses which are not
adequately elevated or protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1163.02 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of the Flood Plain Overlay District (FP) to regulate the
use of floodplains for purposes which could be detrimental to health and
welfare for citizens of the Village. The FP District is an overlay zoning
district. This means that the underlying district standards and requirements
shall apply in addition to the Flood Plain Overlay District (FP) regulations
and requirements. (Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1163.03 LANDS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
   For the purpose of this Ordinance, "flood plains" are defined as those lands
subject to inundation by the 100 year flood. Such areas shall be as identified
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps as identified in the Ordinance cited below, as well as subsequent
amendments or revisions thereto.
(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1163.04 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The standards, requirements and administrative procedures for development of
land within the FP District shall be as stated in Chapter
1325 of the Building Code, and as specified in the underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)

1165.01 ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSES.
   The Planned Unit Development District (P.U.D.) is established to provide
flexibility in the arrangement and design of a site by moving beyond the
standard, more rigid, conventional zoning district regulations. A P.U.D. is
designed to produce more efficient use of the land and more amenities and
benefits for the community and users of the development. This is done by
encouraging developers to use a more creative approach in development and to
achieve:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements.
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreational areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services.
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and which
prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
   (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development, resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets.
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with the land use density,
transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan.
   Development under planned unit development provisions provides a means of
encouraging ingenuity, imagination and flexibility on the part of landowners,
engineers, architects, site planners and developers in the planning and design
of land areas. It is not the intent of the planned unit development provisions
to allow applicants to circumvent the intent of this Zoning Code or to allow
development of land not in conformance with the Land Use Plan of the Village.
(Ord. 2006-03. Passed 2-21-06.)
   
1165.02 PERMITTED USES.
   The following uses shall be permitted in the P.U.D. District:
   (a)   Residential dwelling types developed in a unified manner in accordance
with an approved plan.
   (b)   Schools, parks and playfield facilities.
   (c)   Churches and other institutions for the purpose of religious worship.
   (d)   Recreational facilities and amenities as may be provided for the use
of the residents of the dwellings.
   (e)   Neighborhood shopping centers not comprising more than ten percent
(10%) of the total site acreage and developed in a united manner.
      (Ord. 2006-03. Passed 2-21-06.)

1169.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these requirements is to encourage the orderly development of
parking and loading areas within the Village and to promote the safety of
residents and visitors by insuring the efficient handling of vehicular traffic.
1169.02 PROVISION FOR PARKING REQUIRED.
   In all zoning districts, at the time any building, structure or use is
changed, established, erected, developed, or is enlarged or increased in
capacity, there shall be provided off-street parking spaces in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
1169.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Access. All off-street parking and loading areas provided in
accordance with this section shall have direct access to a publicly dedicated
and improved street or alley.
 
   (b)   Surfacing. All off-street parking areas shall be properly graded,
drained, marked and surfaced so as to provide a hard, durable and dustless
surface.
   (c)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect light away from any adjoining premises in
any zoning district where residences are a permitted use. In addition, such
lighting shall be so arranged as to not interfere with traffic on any adjoining
street or to be confused with any traffic control lighting.
   (d)   Location of Parking Spaces.
      (1)   Proximity to street right-of-way. In all districts, a five (5) foot
clear zone shall be maintained between the street right-of-way line, and any
parking space. Parking areas shall be so designed and arranged as to not allow
the protruding of any vehicle (or portion thereof) over the clear zone.
      (2)   Proximity to use.  
         A.   In the VC District, required parking and loading spaces shall be
provided either on the same lot, or within 200 feet of the principal use which
they serve.
         B.   In all other Districts, required parking and loading spaces shall
be provided on the same lot as the principal use which they serve.
   (e)   Joint Provision of Parking Facilities. Two or more buildings or uses
located in the same area may meet parking and loading requirements by the joint
provision of parking and loading facilities, provided those facilities are
located so as to meet the requirements of subsection (d) hereof, and the number
of spaces so provided shall not be less than the sum of required spaces as per
Section
1169.04  of this Ordinance.
   (f)   Parking Limitations in Residential Districts. Travel trailers, motor
homes, pick-up campers, folding tent trailers, boats or boat trailers and
similar recreational equipment and/or inoperable vehicles shall not be parked
on streets or alleys in any district where residences are a permitted use. The
storage of such equipment shall also be subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Not more than two (2) pieces of recreational equipment, not more
than one which can be a motor home, shall be permitted to be stored outside on
a parcel containing a single family or two-family dwelling. For the purpose of
this Section, a boat stored on a boat trailer shall be deemed one piece of
recreational equipment.
      (2)   Recreational equipment shall not be occupied or used for living,
sleeping and/or housekeeping for a period of time exceeding two (2) weeks.
   (g)   Provision of Parking in the VC District. The Village Center District
contains small lots and is served by on street parking. For these reasons,
special regulations are justified in this district. Non-residential uses
located within the VC District must provide only thirty percent (30%) of the
required spaces as specified in Section 
1169.04 , provided that - in all cases - sufficient off- street spaces shall be
provided for all employees of the establishment.

1171.06 MEASUREMENT OF SIGN.
   For the purposes of this Ordinance, the measurement of sign area shall
comply with the following standards:
   (a)   Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of the sign
not including bracing, framing and structural supports of the sign, unless such
support members are made part of the message or face of the design.
   (b)   Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces of
the sign shall be included in determining the area of the sign. For spherical
signs, the sphere shall be bisected by an imaginary line through the center of
the sphere, and the surface area of the half sphere shall be counted as the
sign face. For cubical signs, the area of all display faces shall be included
in determining the area of the sign.
   (c)   The area of the letters, numbers or emblems mounted on a building wall
or wall extension shall be computed by enclosing such sign with the smallest
single continuous perimeter consisting of rectangular or series of rectangles
around the letters, number or emblems, and determining the area.
   (d)   For structures and uses having no direct frontage on public roads, as
within shopping centers, frontage shall be counted as the intersection of the
building line onto adjacent drives or parking areas.
1171.07 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Abandonment. The continuance of an existing sign which does not meet
the regulations and requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a
nonconforming sign which shall terminate by abandonment when any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   When the sign is associated with an abandoned use.
      (2)   When the sign remains after the termination of a business. A
business has ceased operations if it is closed to the public for at least
ninety (90) consecutive days. Seasonal businesses are exempt from this
requirement.
      (3)   When the sign is not maintained or does not conform to the
following:
         A.   All signs, together with all supports, braces, guys and anchors
shall be kept in a proper state of repair.
         B.   Every sign and the immediately surrounding premises shall be
maintained by the owner, or his agent, in a clean sanitary and inoffensive
condition, free from all obnoxious substances, rubbish and weeds.
   Upon finding that the sign is abandoned, the right to maintain and use such
sign shall terminate immediately.
   (b)   Relocation or Replacement. A nonconforming sign shall not be
structurally relocated or replaced unless it is brought into compliance with
the provisions of this Section. Should any replacement or relocation occur
without being brought into compliance, the sign shall be existing illegally,
and subject to the penalties as specified in Section
1171.08  of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Maintenance. A nonconforming sign shall be maintained or repaired in
accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   The size and structural shape of the sign shall not be changed or
altered. The copy may be changed provided that the change applies to the
original use associated with the sign at the time the sign became
nonconforming. The copy area shall not be enlarged.
      (2)   In case damage occurs to the sign to the extent that more than 50
percent (50%) of the replacement value is lost, the sign shall be removed
within sixty (60) days.
1171.08 PENALTIES.
   Any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association violating any
provision of this chapter or failing to obey any lawful order issued pursuant

1173.01 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of these landscaping regulations is to specifically encourage
the preservation and replacement of major trees removed in the course of land
development, to promote the utilization of landscaping as a buffer between
particular land uses, and to minimize noise, air and/or visual pollution and
artificial light glare.
1173.02 UNDESIRABLE TREES.
   The following species of trees shall be deemed undesirable, and their use
for landscaping purposes within the Village of Ashville shall be discouraged.
In no case shall these species be planted within twenty-five (25) feet from any
water, sanitary or storm drainage lines within the boundaries of the Village.
   (a)   Box-Elder (Acer negundo).
   (b)   Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum).
   (c)   Catalpa (Catalpa speciosa).

   (g)   Willows (all kinds) (Salix).
1173.03 TREE PRESERVATION.
   When preparing and reviewing site and development plans, good faith effort
shall be made to preserve natural vegetation. Streets, lots, structures and
parking areas should be laid out to avoid unnecessary destruction of heavily
wooded areas or outstanding tree specimens.
1173.04 LANDSCAPE SCREENING.
   (a)   Screening of Uses in Particular Districts. The development standards
for particular districts require the installation of landscaped "buffer" areas
of those side or rear yards that are adjacent to districts where single or two-
family residences are permitted uses. When required, such screening shall
consist of walls, landscaped earthen mounds, fences, natural vegetation or an
acceptable combination of these elements, provided that screening must be at
least seven (7) feet in height. The use of year-round vegetation, such as pines
or evergreens, is encouraged. Landscaped screening shall have at least seventy-
five percent (75%) opacity during full foliage.
   (b)   Screening of Trash Receptacles. The development standards for
particular zoning districts require the screening of trash receptacles to
effectively screen them from view. In those cases where screening is required,
landscaping can be utilized to meet the requirement, provided the standards for
such landscaping meet the requirements of subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Maintenance of Shrubbery and Hedges. In any district, no shrubbery or
hedge shall be planted, in such a manner that any portion of growth extends
beyond the property line. The owner or occupant of property on which there is
shrubbery, hedges, or trees located so as to affect the vision of drivers on
adjacent streets shall keep shrubbery and hedges trimmed to a maximum of thirty
(30) inches in height, and keep trees trimmed so as to avoid covering or
obscuring of traffic visibility or traffic control signals.
1173.05 LANDSCAPE MATERIALS USED AS BUFFERS.
   Landscape materials utilized in meeting requirements of this Ordinance
should complement the form of existing trees and plantings, as well as the
general design and architecture of the developed area. The type of sun or shade
should be considered in selecting plant materials. Artificial plants are
prohibited. All landscape materials shall be living plants and shall meet the
following requirements.
   (a)   Deciduous Trees. Trees which normally shed their leaves in the fall,
shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than fifteen
(15) feet and having trunks which can be maintained with over five (5) feet of

intersections where the clear wood requirement shall be eight (8) feet. A
minimum of ten (10) feet overall height, or a minimum caliper (trunk diameter
as measured six inches above the ground) of at least two (2) inches immediately
after planting shall be required. Trees of undesirable species, as cited in
1173.02 above, are prohibited.
   (b)   Evergreen Trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of three (3) feet
high with a minimum caliper of one (1) inch immediately after planting.

1183.01 GENERAL APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Conformity with Standards. The design standards and requirements of
this chapter shall apply to all subdivisions of land as defined in Chapter
1107. All public improvements undertaken in any subdivision shall conform to
the improvement standards of this Ordinance, the “Village of Ashville
Regulations and Material Specifications”, and the “City of Columbus
Construction Material and Specifications”, as may be subsequently amended. In
case of conflict between these standards, the most restrictive shall apply.
   (b)   Streets. The arrangement, character, width and location of all
arterial and collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan and the Ashville Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Thoroughfares
not contained in said Plan shall conform to the recommendations of the Planning
and Zoning Board based on the design standards set forth in this Ordinance.
   (c)   Zoning. No subdivision or plat of land within the corporate boundaries
of the Village of Ashville shall be approved unless it conforms with the zoning
requirements as specified in Titles One through Five of this Ordinance. (Ord.
2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1183.02 LAND SUITABILITY.
   If the Planning and Zoning Board finds that land proposed for subdivision
development is unsuitable due to flooding, poor drainage, topography,
inadequate public facilities, and/or other condition that may be detrimental to
the general health, safety or welfare of the public, the Board shall not
approve such subdivision unless adequate methods are proposed by the Owner/
Developer for alleviating the problems that would be created by development of
the land. The Planning and Zoning Board may attach conditions to the approval
of subdivisions in areas determined to be subject to the provisions of this
Section. (Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1183.03 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Measures shall be taken by the Owner/Developer to minimize erosion and its
impacts during subdivision construction activity. The Planning and Zoning Board
may require detailed erosion and sedimentation plans to be submitted if it
determines that the size and/or scale of the proposed subdivision warrants such
action. Generally, such a plan shall be required for any proposed land
disturbance of five (5) acres or more or according to current Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) recommendations, whichever is more restrictive. Such
plans shall indicate the techniques to be used to control erosion both during
and after construction and permanently, and include a schedule for installing
same. Erosion control plans shall be based on the control of erosion on-site,
with the objective of eliminating or minimizing erosion and sedimentation
impacts off-site. Techniques, devices and/or measures used shall be reviewed
and approved by the Village Engineer.
   Proposed erosion and sediment control design shall conform to the most
recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development, Ohio's Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection manual,
published by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR).
   An Ohio EPA Notice of Intent (NOI) permit shall be obtained prior to any
ground disturbance of five (5) acres or more according to current EPA
requirements.
   All erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be in place at the start
of construction activity. (Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)
1183.04 SURFACE RUNOFF AND STORM DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Outlets. No subdivision shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Board unless there is an adequate outlet for stormwater as determined by the
Village Engineer. Generally it will be necessary to pipe storm water to an
adequate watercourse, stream or existing storm system which has the capacity to
accommodate the flow, or to utilize acceptable on-site water retention methods
adequate to minimize excessive off-site stormwater flows
   (b)   Preservation of Natural Drainage Courses. No natural drainage course
shall be altered and no fill, buildings or structures shall be located unless
provision is made for the flow of surface water, in a manner satisfactory to
the Village Engineer. An easement shall be provided on both sides of the
existing surface drainage course adequate for the purpose of future widening,
deepening, enclosing or otherwise improving said drainage course. If such
drainage course crosses private property, easements must be obtained by the
Owner/Developer for construction and future maintenance. These easements must
be shown on the Construction Plans. A copy of the recorded easement shall be
shown on the final plat or incorporated by reference to the volume and page
number of the recorded easement
   (c)   Grades. All surface areas not covered by a hard surface improvement or
stone shall be seeded or sodded and sloped to drain, according to the
following:
      (1)   Grass areas shall have a minimum slope or grade of one percent
(1.0%).
      (2)   Grass areas next to buildings shall slope away from the building at
not less than five percent (5%) for a minimum of ten feet.
      (3)   Ditches or swales in grassed areas with a bottom slope or grade
between two percent and seven percent (2-7%) shall be sodded.
      (4)   Ditches or swales with a bottom slope or grade greater than seven
percent (7%) shall have a paved or stone gutter as required by the Village
Engineer.
      (5)   Ditches or channels with a slope flatter than one percent (1.0%)
shall have a paved bottom.
   (d)   Drainage Data.
      (1)   Stormwater management practices for proposed development shall
conform with the design standards and requirements as set forth in the
“Stormwater Design Manual” (Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission; June, 1977)
as may be subsequently revised.
      (2)   The storm drainage system of a proposed subdivision shall be
designed to flow full conveying the stormwater runoff generated by a two (2)
year frequency storm. The system shall also be capable of accommodating a five
(5) year frequency storm such that the hydraulic grade line does not exceed the
top of any structure grade.
      (3)   A major storm flood routing path shall be designed for all
developments. This route shall be a part of the required storm drainage system
and designed to carry stormwater runoff from a storm with a frequency of not
less than 100 years, without causing significant threat to property or public
safety. Depth of flow shall not exceed six inches (6") above the curb. An
easement must be dedicated for the protection and maintenance of this flood
route.
      (4)   Drainage calculations shall be submitted along with a master
drainage plan to the Zoning Inspector at the same time the construction
drawings and/or Development Plan is submitted.
   (e)   Culverts. All culverts utilized in subdivisions shall have the
appropriate headwalls and other structures and improvements to protect the
facility, as determined by the Village Engineer. Such culverts shall be
designed according to the most current Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT)
drainage design recommendations.
(Ord. 2000-14. Passed 7-24-00.)

facilities provided with the proceeds of impact fees;
   (d)    To ensure impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter are expended
only on public facilities the demand for which is generated by the new
development against which the fees are assessed;
   (e)    To ensure impact fees assessed pursuant to this chapter are
proportionate in amount to the degree of impact new development has on public
facilities; and
   (f)    To ensure all applicable legal standards and criteria are properly
incorporated in these procedures.

inconsistency.
      (6)    Governmental uses. Prior to the application for a zoning permit, a
local, regional, State or Federal governmental agency or school district may
seek an exemption to this chapter by applying to Village Council, who shall
review all such exemption applications and shall establish a reasonable basis
for the granting or denying of all such requests.
      (7)    Other uses. No Impact Fee shall be imposed on a use, development,
project, structure, building, fence, sign or other activity whether a zoning
permit is required, which does not result in an increase in the demand for
public facilities.
      (8)    Non-profit organizations. No Impact Fee shall be imposed on any
nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a non-business entity, not-for-
profit organization, or nonprofit institution, or any other legal entity

with an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a profit for its
owners.
      (9)    Extraordinary Economic Development. Village Council may exempt
all, or part of, a particular development project from Impact Fees if such
project is determined, under the criteria set forth below, to create
extraordinary economic development and/or employment growth.
         A.    The Village hereby establishes a policy to encourage employment
growth and economic development in order to provide a balance between jobs and
housing, provide adequate income levels for its residents, and to promote
balanced and orderly growth. Further, it is the intent of this section to
establish a mechanism that removes potential regulatory barriers to the
establishment of businesses that provide employment and economic development in
the Village, and it is the further specific intent of this section that the
waiver provisions contained herein shall not apply to residential developments.
The Village specifically desires to review all applications for exemptions on
an individual basis and further wants the review and approval process to be
fair, consistent, and based on established criteria. Also, the process should
ensure the businesses that are granted exemptions provide the benefits recited
in this section and the due process rights of all applicants are protected.
         B.    In order to grant an exemption under this section, Village
Council shall:
            i.    Review the Village Administrator's recommendation and the
Finance Committee's recommendation, and shall;
            ii.    Conduct a public hearing at which the applicant may explain
the elements of its application and present any further information that may
assist in Village Council's review, and may;
            iii.    Grant the requested exemption only if Village Council
determines:
               a.    The application fully meets the policies herein
established; and
               b.    The projected employment growth is based on either
existing payroll figures or other available evidence that reflects a potential
annual payroll that exceeds two and one-half million dollars ($2,500,000.00)
and it is recognized that this threshold may be adjusted upward based on an
annual Council review; and
               c.    The value of the exemption or waiver is recovered in
twenty-four (24) months based on projected income tax revenues from the
development.
            iv.    Enter into a written contract with the Applicant that
requires the Applicant to repay the exempted Impact Fees if the conditions
under which the exemption was granted are not fully and timely met.
               (Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
1194.04  PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION, REIMBURSEMENT, CREDIT, AND
COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (a)    In General. The Village Administrator must notify the applicant of
the applicable
Impact Fee requirements, including applicable service charges, at the time of
application for a zoning permit on a form provided by the Village. The Village
Administrator must calculate the applicable impact fee at the time of
application for a zoning permit. The Village may not issue a zoning permit
until the applicant has paid all impact fees due pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)    Non-binding Impact Fee Estimate. An applicant may request a non-
binding estimate of Impact Fees due for a particular new development at any
time by filing a request on a form provided for such purpose by the Village;
provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal
application for a zoning permit for new development is made. Such non-binding
estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and in no way
binds the Village or precludes it from making amendments or revisions to any
provisions of this chapter or the specific impact fee implementing ordinances.
No vested rights, legal entitlements, or equitable estoppel accrue by reason of
a non-binding estimate. A non-binding fee estimate does not constitute a final
decision and may not be appealed.
   (c)    Calculation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of an application for a zoning permit, the Village
Administrator must determine:
         A.   Whether the proposed new development constitutes a residential or
nonresidential use;
         B.   The specific category of residential or nonresidential
development; and
         C.   The amount of additional square feet of nonresidential gross
floor area or the number of additional dwelling units associated with the
proposed use.
      (2)    If the application for a zoning permit involves a change in zoning
district, the Impact Fee must be calculated upon the incremental increase in
the public facility capacity created by the proposed change in zoning district.
      (3)    After making these determinations, the Village Administrator must
calculate the applicable Impact Fee by multiplying the number of dwelling units
or amount of nonresidential floor area proposed by the amount of the applicable
Impact Fee per unit of development, incorporating any applicable exemptions or
credits.
      (4)    If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in this Chapter and Impact Fee schedule, the Village
Administrator, in consultation with other Village staff and consultants, as
necessary, must:
         A.    Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the
Impact Fee based on the Impact Fee for the land use identified;
         B.    Identify the broader land use category within which the
specified land use would apply and calculate the Impact Fee based on the Impact
Fee for that land use category; or
         C.    As appropriate, determine the basis used to calculate the Impact
Fee pursuant to an independent impact analysis pursuant to subsection (d)
below.
         D.    The Village Administrator's determination must be based on a
generally accepted land use classification system (e.g., the North American
Industry Classification System, the Land-Based Classification Standards, and/or
ITE' s Trip Generation Manual) and the methodology report.
      (5)    The calculation of Impact Fees due from a multiple-use new
development must reflect the aggregated demand for each public facility
generated by each land use type within the proposed new development.
      (6)    The calculation of Impact Fees due from a phased new development
must reflect the demand generated by each specific land use within the phase of
development for which a separate zoning permit is requested.
      (7)    Impact fees must be calculated based on the Impact Fee amount in
effect at the time of application for a zoning permit.
   (d)    Independent Impact Analysis. If the applicant believes the Impact Fee
calculations are in error or would violate a right that is protected by either
the State or Federal constitutions, the applicant shall conduct an Impact Fee
analysis. The following provisions shall apply to any independent impact
analysis:
      (1)    The applicant is responsible, at its sole expense, for conducting
and preparing the independent impact analysis, which must be reviewed for
approval by the Village Administrator prior to payment of the fee.
      (2)    The independent impact analysis must measure the impact that the
proposed new development will have on the specific public facility at issue,
must be based on the same methodologies used in the methodology report, and
must be supported by professionally acceptable data and assumptions.
      (3)    Within sixty (60) days of submittal of the independent impact
analysis, the Village Administrator must provide written notice to the
applicant as to whether the analysis is accepted or rejected based on the
provisions of this section. If the independent impact analysis is rejected, the
written notice must provide an explanation of the insufficiencies of the
analysis.
      (4)    The final decision of the Village Administrator may be appealed to
Village Council. The filing of an appeal does not stay the imposition, or the
collection of the Impact Fee as calculated by the Village Administrator unless
a cash bond or other sufficient surety has been provided to the Fiscal Officer.
The Fiscal Officer shall hold the bond or surety pending outcome of all
available appeals. If the appeal is accompanied by a cash bond or other
sufficient surety, in an amount equal to the Impact Fee calculated to be due, a
zoning permit may be issued pending resolution of the final appeal.
   (e)    Reimbursements and Credits.
      (1)    Eligibility for a reimbursement. The Village may enter into a
development agreement with an applicant, which provides for the reimbursement
of Impact Fees in exchange for the dedication or construction of public
facilities made necessary by a proposed new development. The Village may
reimburse Impact Fees already paid only for the type of facility dedicated or
constructed by the applicant. Reimbursements must be made from the Impact Fee
Fund. No Impact Fee may be reimbursed for a proffered public facility unless:
         A.    It is included in the Village's capital and operating budgets,
capital improvement plan, or the methodology report; or
         B.    It adds public facility capacity made necessary by and to be
provided for the roughly proportionate benefit of new development.
      (2)    Additional provisions.
         A.    In order to be eligible for a reimbursement, the applicant must
receive approval by the Village pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
         B.    The Village shall not reimburse the applicant in an amount
exceeding the amount of the Impact Fee due pursuant to this chapter.
         C.    The Village shall not reimburse the applicant until a proffered
land dedication is finalized or the construction project is at least fifty
percent (50%) complete. Reimbursement may then occur based on the percent
completion of the project on a pro rata basis.
         D.    If an applicant proposes to dedicate or construct public
facilities valued at an amount greater than the amount of the Impact Fee due,
then the development agreement may provide for reimbursements to the applicant
by future developers of costs incurred over and above those reimbursed by the
Village.
      (3)    Procedures for reimbursements.
         A.    Application made to the Village Administrator. Applications for
an agreement by the Village to provide a reimbursement upon completion of
certain work by the applicant must be made on a form provided by the Village.
The application must be accompanied by a proposed development agreement
developed through coordination with Village staff. Upon receipt of a complete
application an proposed development agreement, the Village Administrator and
other appropriate staff and/or consultants must review the application and
proposed development agreement, as well as such other information and evidence
as may be deemed relevant. The Village Administrator must forward a
recommendation report stating whether a reimbursement is proper, based on the
provisions of this chapter, to Village Council. The Village Administrator's
recommendation report shall assume that upon completion of the work by the
applicant as set forth within the proposed development agreement the same will
comply in all material ways with the proposed development agreement and Village
standards.
         B.    Village Council. Based on the Village Administrator's
recommendation report, the provisions of this chapter, the capital improvement
plan, comprehensive plan, adopted Village budget, and the methodology report,
Village Council shall make a final decision to accept, reject, or accept with
conditions the proposed reimbursement and proposed development agreement.
         C.    Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of Village Council
shall be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Pickaway County. The filing of an
appeal does not stay the imposition or the collection of the Impact Fee as
calculated by the Village Administrator unless a cash bond or other sufficient
surety has been provided to the Fiscal Officer. The Fiscal Officer shall hold
the bond or surety pending outcome of all available appeals. If the appeal is
accompanied by a cash bond or other sufficient surety, in an amount equal to
the Impact Fee calculated to be due, a zoning permit may be issued pending
resolution of the final appeal.
      (4)    Calculation of the value of dedication or construction. The amount
of the reimbursement to be paid by the Village is to be calculated as follows:
         A.    Construction of facilities and provision of equipment. The
reimbursement must be equal to the actual cost of construction or equipment as
evidenced by receipts and other sufficient documentation or the amount of
Impact Fees due pursuant to this chapter, whichever is less.
         B.    Dedication of land. At the option of the applicant, the
reimbursement is to be based on either the assessed value of the proffered
land, based on the most recent County property appraisal, or the fair market
value of the land as determined by a certified property appraiser hired and
paid for by the applicant. If the latter option is chosen and the Village
rejects the applicant's appraisal, the Village may hire and pay for a second
appraiser to appraise the property. If either party rejects the second
appraisal, a third appraisal may be performed by an appraiser chosen by the
first and second appraisers, the costs of which are to be shared equally by the
Village and the applicant. The third appraisal is binding on both parties. All
appraisals must be consistent with generally accepted appraisal techniques and
the date of valuation must be the date of transfer to the Village.
      (5)    Development agreement requirements. No reimbursement may be made
except pursuant to an executed development agreement between the Village and
the applicant, which must include, but is not necessarily limited to; the
following:
         A.    The estimated cost of the public facility to be constructed or
dedicated, based on the provisions of this chapter;
         B.    A schedule for the initiation and completion of the construction
of a public facility;
         C.    The amount of the Impact Fees to be reimbursed by the Village to
the applicant;
         D.    The schedule for making reimbursement payments to the applicant,
based on the provisions of this section;
         E.    Provision for reimbursements to the applicant by future
developers of costs incurred over and above those reimbursed by the Village
pursuant to this section;
         F.    The applicant's agreement to construct all public facilities in
accordance with Village specifications and all regulations set forth in the
Codified Ordinances; and
         G.    Such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the
Village.
      (6)    Transfer and assignment. The reimbursement may be paid only to the
original applicant or the applicant's legal successor in interest with a
contractual right to the reimbursement.
      (7)    Eligibility for credits for excessive dedication or construction.
An applicant may be given a credit against an Impact Fee upon demonstration
that, after the date of this chapter, a public facility was dedicated or
constructed by the applicant with sufficient excess capacity to offset the
impacts of the applicant's proposed new development. For a credit to be
accepted, the applicant must demonstrate the dedicated or constructed public
facility will reduce the overall need for public facilities and the applicant
has secured a contractual right to an allocation of the excess capacity equal
to the total or any portion of the Impact Fee owed by the applicant. Any
approved credit must be consistent with the adopted Village budget, capital
improvement plan, comprehensive plan, and the methodology report.
      (8)   Procedures for credits.
         A.    Application made to the Village Administrator. Applications for
a credit must be made on a form provided by the Village. The application must
be accompanied by a development agreement executed after the effective date of
this chapter, which demonstrates that excess public facility capacity has been
provided by the applicant, which will provide a roughly proportionate benefit
to the new development proposed by the applicant. Upon receipt of a complete
application, the Village Administrator, and other appropriate staff and/or
consultants must review the application, as well as such other information and
evidence as may be deemed relevant. The Village Administrator must forward a
recommendation report stating whether a credit is proper, based on the
provisions of this chapter, to Village Council. The Village Administrator's
recommendation report shall assume that upon completion of the work by the
applicant as set forth within the proposed development agreement the same will
comply in all material ways with the proposed development agreement and Village
standards.
         B.    Village Council. Based on the Village Administrator's
recommendation report, the provisions of this chapter, the capital improvement
plan, comprehensive plan, adopted Village budget, and the methodology report,
Village Council must make a final decision to accept, reject, or accept with
conditions the proposed credit and proposed development agreement.
         C.    Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of Village Council
shall be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Pickaway County. The filing of an
appeal does not stay the imposition, or the collection of the Impact Fee as
calculated by the Village Administrator unless a cash bond or other sufficient
surety has been provided to the Fiscal Officer. The Fiscal Officer shall hold
the bond or surety pending outcome of all available appeals. If the appeal is
accompanied by a cash bond or other sufficient surety, in an amount equal to
the Impact Fee calculated to be due, a zoning permit may be issued pending
resolution of the final appeal.
   (e)    Collection. The Village must collect all Impact Fees and service
charges in the amounts set forth in this chapter at the time of application for
a zoning permit and must issue a receipt to the applicant for such payment
unless:
      (1)    The applicant is not subject to the payment of an Impact Fee; or
      (2)    The applicant has filed an appeal and the appeal is accompanied by
a cash bond or other sufficient surety, in an amount equal to the Impact Fee
calculated to be due.
         (Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
1194.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPACT FEE FUND; USE AND APPROPRIATION OF IMPACT FEE
PROCEEDS; AND REFUNDS.
   (a)    Impact Fee Accounting. The Fiscal Officer must establish an impact
fee fund and all Impact Fees collected by the Village must be deposited into
such impact fee fund. All interest earned on monies deposited into the impact
fee fund must be credited to that fund. The monies of such impact fee fund must
be accounted for separately from all other Village funds. The Fiscal Officer
must establish and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure the impact
fee fund is properly deposited, accounted for, and appropriated in accordance
with this chapter and other
applicable legal requirements.
   (b)    Use of Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)    Generally. All appropriations from impact fee funds must be
approved by Village Council and detailed on a form provided for such purposes
and filed with the Village Administrator.
      (2)    Use of funds. Impact fee funds may be used only for
         A.    Public facility expenditures;
         B.    The payment of principal, interest, and other financing costs on
contracts, bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by, or on behalf of, the
Village to finance public facilities;
         C.    Financing of refunds;
         D.    Financing of reimbursements; or
         E.    Financing the costs of updating this chapter.
      (3)    Report. Prior to appropriating impact fee funds, the Village
Administrator must generate a written report which demonstrates such funds are
being used to finance public facility capacity that provides or will provide
benefits to new development that are roughly proportionate to the impact of
that development. The report must be consistent with the methodology report.
The written report must be presented to and accepted by Village Council.
      (4)    Restrictions on use. Impact Fees may not be appropriated for
repair or maintenance of public facilities, or for operational or personnel
expenses associated with the provision of public facilities. Additionally,
Impact Fees must be appropriated:
         A.    For the particular public facility for which they were imposed,
calculated, and collected; and
         B.    Within six (6) years of the beginning of the Village's fiscal
year immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period is
extended as provided in paragraph (b)(5), below.
      (5)    Appropriation of impact fee funds beyond six (6) years of
collection. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, impact fee funds may be
appropriated beyond six (6) years from the beginning of the Village's fiscal
year immediately succeeding the date of collection, if the appropriation is for
a public facility that requires more than six years to plan, design, and
construct. The Village must document compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph.
   (c)    Procedure for Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)    Each year, Village Council must identify public facility capacity
anticipated to be funded, in whole or in part, with Impact Fees. Public
facility expenditures must be consistent with the methodology report, the
capital improvement plan, the comprehensive plan, and the annual review and
such other information as may be relevant to ensure compliance with this
chapter.
      (2)    Village Council may include public facilities funded with Impact
Fees in the Village's annual budget or capital improvements plan. If included,
the description of the public facility must specify the nature of the public
facility, the location of the public facility, the capacity to be added and/or
funded by the appropriation, the service area of the public facility, the need/
demand for the public facility, and the anticipated timing of completion of the
public facility.
      (3)    Consistent with the provisions of this chapter, Village Council
may authorize public facilities expenditures at such other times as it deems
necessary.
      (4)    Village Council must verify that adequate impact fee funds are or
will be available for the particular public facility capacity.
      (5)    Because Impact Fees must be used in a location or manner that
would provide benefit to the development supplying the funds, Impact Fees must
be used in the order in which they were received related to that New

An applicant may apply for a refund of Impact Fees if the Village failed to

as provided in subsection (b)(5) above. The refund application must be made on
a form provided by the Village.
         C.    Abandonment of new development. An applicant, who paid an Impact
Fee for which a zoning permit has been issued and pursuant to which
construction has been initiated but abandoned prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, is eligible for a refund if the uncompleted building
is completely demolished and the site is returned to the same or similar
condition as before construction began.
      (2)    Administrative fee. The Village may deduct a five hundred dollar
($500.00) administrative fee from the amount of any refund granted and retain

processing a refund application.
      (3)    Processing of applications for a refund.
         A.    Application made to the Village Administrator. Applications for
a refund must be made on a form provided by the Village. Upon receipt of a
complete refund application, the Village Administrator must review the

such other information and evidence as may be deemed relevant and must forward
a report as to whether a refund is due based on the provisions of this chapter
to Village Council.
         B.    Village Council. Based on the report of the Village
Administrator, the provisions of this chapter, and the methodology report,
Village Council must make a final decision to approve, approve with conditions,
or deny the proposed refund.
         C.    Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of Village Council
shall be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Pickaway County. The filing of an
appeal does not stay the imposition or the collection of the Impact Fee as
calculated by the Village Administrator unless a cash bond or other sufficient
surety has been provided to the Fiscal Officer. The Fiscal Officer shall hold
the bond or surety pending outcome of all available appeals. If the appeal is
accompanied by a cash bond or other sufficient surety, in an amount equal to
the Impact Fee calculated to be due, a zoning permit may be issued pending
resolution of the final appeal.
      (4)    Refund because of expiration or revocation. Applications for

person or entity applying for the refund was the initial applicant who paid the
fee, or the authorized agent of the initial applicant; (b) the amount of the
Impact Fees paid; and (c) documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation

and full waiver of entitlement to any refund. No interest will be paid by the
Village when calculating the amount of a refund pursuant to this paragraph.
      (5)    Refund because of the Village's failure to timely appropriate.
Applications for refunds due to the failure of the Village to timely

      (6)    Refund because of abandonment. Applications for refunds due to
abandonment of a new development prior to completion must be on a form provided
by the Village. Failure to apply for a refund within sixty (60) days following

interest will be paid by the Village in calculating the amount of the refund
pursuant to this paragraph. The application must include: (a) evidence the
person applying for the refund is the initial applicant who paid the fee, or

1325.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Village of Ashville, State of Ohio does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)    The flood hazard areas of the Village of Ashville are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)    Uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
         (Ord. 99-24. Passed 9-20-99.)

1325.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Ashville as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development referenced in subsection (b)
hereof, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Ashville.
   (b)   Basis For Establishing The Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in a scientific
and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study for the Pickaway County,
Ohio and Incorporated Areas”. This study, with accompanying Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated September 30, 1999 and,
for areas annexed by the Village of Ashville, the “Flood Insurance Study for
the Unincorporated Areas of Pickaway County”, with accompanying Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated September 30, 1999,
and any revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at the Municipal
Building.
   (c)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless
specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1325.04 (b).
   (d)   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
       (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
       (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
       (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)   Warning And Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of Ashville, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violations And Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction
thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of
Ashville. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Ashville from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. The Village of Ashville shall prosecute any violation of this
chapter in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 99-24. Passed 9-20-99.)
1325.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
obtained from the Planning and Zoning Inspector before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in
Section
1325.03 (b) . Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Planning and Zoning Inspector and may include, but not be
limited to: site specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the
location of the foregoing. The following information is required:
      (1)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (2)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1325.05(b)(2)A. where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (3)    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1325.05(b)(2)A. where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (4)    Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.

surveyor of the structure's as-built lowest floor or floodproofed elevation.
   (b)   Exemption From Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
Development Permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than $1,000.00. Any
proposed action exempt from filing for a Development Permit is also exempt from
the standards of this chapter.
   (c)   Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator. The Planning
and Zoning Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions.
   (d)   Duties And Responsibilities of the Planning and Zoning Inspector. The
duties and responsibilities of the Planning and Zoning Inspector shall include
but are not limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.
         A.   Review all development permit applications to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permit applications to assure that all
necessary permits have been received from those federal, state or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits
issued by the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1325.05(c)(1) is met.
         D.   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1325.03 (b), are designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within
these areas, the Planning and Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, including data obtained under Section
1325.05 (b)(6), in order to administer Section
1325.05 (b)(1); Section
1325.05 (b)(2); and where floodway data are available, administer Section
1325.05 (c).
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained by the Village of
Ashville.  Where base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of special
flood hazard on the Village of Ashville’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless
of the source of such data the Planning and Zoning Inspector shall:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection (a)(3).
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, variance
documentation, Conditional Letters of Map Revision, Letters of Map Revision,
Letters of Map Amendment, and as-built elevations.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.
         A.   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation required in subsection (a)(4)
that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse will not be diminished.
          C.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section 
1325.06 . 
      (6)   Alteration of community boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the Village of Ashville have been modified
by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer
has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a
particular area. In order that the Village of Ashville's Flood Insurance Rate
Map accurately represent the Village of Ashville's boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the Village of Ashville suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the Village of Ashville has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
         (Ord. 99-24. Passed 9-20-99.)
1325.05 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)   General Standards. The following standards apply in all areas of

         A.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
the base flood elevation.
         B.   In AO zones new construction and substantial improvements shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number on Village of Ashville’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified, and
adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction.
         A.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
            1 .   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the
base flood elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates,
the structure should be floodproofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation;
            2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and,
            3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection.
Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1325.04(a)(3).
         B.   In AO zones new construction and substantial improvements shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number on the Village of
Ashville’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified); or be floodproofed to that level consistent with the floodproofing
standards of subsection (b)(2)A. 1., 2, and 3., and adequate drainage paths
shall be provided around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and
away from proposed structures.
      (3)   Accessory structures.
         A.   A relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing standards may be
granted for accessory structures (e.g., sheds, detached garages) containing no
more than 576 square feet and a value of no more than $1,000 dollars. Such
structures must meet the encroachment provisions of subsection (c) hereof, and
the following additional standards:
            1.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
            2.   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
            3.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
            4.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
            5.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the base flood
elevation; and,
            6.   They shall meet the opening requirements of subsection (b)(5)
hereof.
      (4)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. The following
standards shall apply to all new and substantially improved manufactured homes
not subject to the manufactured home park requirements of Section 3733.01, Ohio
Revised Code:
         A.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
subsection (a)(1)B. hereof.
         B.   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation.
These standards shall also apply to all recreational vehicles that are either
(i) located on sites for 180 days or more, or (ii) are not fully licensed and
ready for highway use.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor. The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential non-basement
structures which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings,
columns, posts, or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
allow unimpeded movement of flood waters. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest
floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must:
.          A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect; or,
         B.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (6)   Subdivisions and large developments. In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1325.03 (b) or Section
1325.04 (d)(2), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less):
         A.   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed
in accordance with standard engineering practices;
         B.   If subsection (b)(6)A. is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (c)   Floodways.
      (1)   Areas with floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in
Section
1325.03 (b) identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as
a floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1325.04 (d)(2). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, projectiles, and cause erosion. The
following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   If subsection (c)(1)A. is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (b) hereof.
         C.   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Planning and Zoning Inspector to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (2)   Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard where
the Flood Insurance Study provides base flood elevation data as set forth in
Section
1325.03 (b), but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.
         B.   If subsection (c)(2)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
            (Ord. 99-24. Passed 9-20-99.)
1325.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Appeal Board.
       (1)    The Planning and Zoning Commission as established by the Village
of Ashville shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Planning and Zoning Commission in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
      (3)    Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning and Zoning
Commission or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Pickaway Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
       (4)    In passing upon such applications, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)    Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(4) hereof and
the purposes of this chapter, the Planning and Zoning Commission, may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
      (6)    The Planning and Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
   (b)   Conditions For Variances.
      (1)    Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items A. to K. in subsection (a)(4) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (5)    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (6)    Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection (a)(4)
hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and,
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

prescribed by Section
1501.04(c), shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) for each violation.
      (5)   Due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with
respect to the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the person being
charged, and the history of the previous violations shall be given whenever a
penalty is assessed under this chapter.
      (6)   For purposes of this section, a serious violation shall be
considered to exist if there is a substantial probability that an occurrence
causing death or serious physical harm to persons could result from a condition
which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations or
processes which have been adopted or are in use, unless the person did not and
could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of
the violation.
