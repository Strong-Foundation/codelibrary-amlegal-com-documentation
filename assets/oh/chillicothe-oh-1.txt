PREFACE
   The Revised Ordinances of the City of Chillicothe, Ohio, 1961, also known as
the City Code, is the fourth complete codification of ordinances in the history
of the City. Previous editions were published in 1899, 1928 and 1949.
   This 1961 Edition of the Revised Ordinances is based upon material contained
in the 1949 Code and all ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted
to December 31, 1960. It also contains a list of special ordinances from 1900
to 1961. The preliminary unit contains a comparative section table showing the
derivation of all sections of the Code. Most sections of the Code have footnote
histories indicating their derivation from the 1949 Code or subsequent
ordinances. Sections without histories contain new material enacted by the
adopting ordinance as provided in Ohio Revised Code 731.23.
   Prior to 1906 ordinances were unnumbered. On January 1, 1906, Ordinance No.
1, New Series (N.S.), was passed and the series concluded with Ordinance No.
3121-58, passed October 16, 1956. All ordinances enacted since the City Charter
became effective on November 14, 1958, are known as the Charter Series (C.S.)
beginning with Ordinance C.S. 1-58, passed November 17, 1958. Beginning January
1, 1965, the City again operates under the Ohio statutory form of government
and ordinances are now numbered consecutively by year, viz. 1965-1.
   The index, contained in the preliminary unit, refers to section numbers of
the Code.
   There are nine component parts or Codes contained in the Revised Ordinances
of Chillicothe, Ohio, 1961. The Codes are subdivided into titles, chapters and
sections. The numbering system follows the general system used in the Ohio
Revised Code in that all Codes, Titles and Chapters are odd numbered so that
there are unassigned numbers which are available for future expansion. Within
chapters, sections may be added either between existing sections by the
addition of a third digit to the right of present numbers or by adding new
numbers in sequence. Penalty sections are designated as          . 99.
   The Editors express their appreciation to William W. Stanhope, Director of
Law, and C.R. Lukens, City Manager, for their invaluable assistance in the
preparation and review of the manuscripts for the Revised Ordinances of the
City of Chillicothe, Ohio, 1961, and to Don. E. Fuller, Esq., for his interest
and cooperation in maintaining the Code to date.

110.01 COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH CITY.
   Council hereby authorizes the appropriate City official to enter into an
amended Co-Operation Agreement with the Chillicothe Metropolitan Housing
Authority as follows:
COOPERATION AGREEMENT
   This agreement entered into this 5th day of November, 1990, by and between
the Chillicothe Metropolitan Housing Authority (herein called the "Local
Authority") and the City of Chillicothe (herein called the "Municipality"),
witnesseth:
   In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties
hereto do agree as follows:
   1.    Whenever used in this Agreement:
(a)    The term "project" shall mean any low-rent housing hereafter developed
as an entity by the Local Authority with financial assistance of the United
States of America acting through the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
(herein called the "Government"); excluding, however, any low-rent housing
project covered by any contract for loans and annual contributions entered into
between the Local Authority and the Government, or its predecessor agencies,
prior to the date of this Agreement.
(b)    The term "taxing body" shall mean the State or any political subdivision
or taxing unit thereof in which a project is situated and which would have
authority to assess or levy real or personal property taxes or to certify such
taxes to a taxing body or public officer to be levied for its use and benefit
with respect to a project if it were not exempt from taxation.
(e)    The term "shelter rent" shall mean the total of all charges to all
tenants of a project for dwelling rents and nondwelling rents (excluding all
other income of such project), less the cost to the Local Authority of all
dwelling and nondwelling utilities.
(d)    The term "slum" shall mean any areas where dwellings predominate which,
by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or design, lack of
ventilation, light or sanitation facilities, or any combination of these
factors, are detrimental to the safety, health or morals.
2.    The Local Authority shall endeavor:
(a)    To secure a contract or contracts with the Government for loans and
annual contributions covering one or more projects comprising approximately 400
units of low-rent housing; and
(b)    To develop and administer such project or projects, each of which shall
be located within the corporate limits of the Municipality. The obligations of
the parties hereto shall apply to each such project.
3.    (a)    Under the constitution and statutes of the State of Ohio, all
projects are exempt from all real and personal property taxes and special
assessments levied or imposed by any taxing body. With respect to any project,
so long as either:
(i)    Such project is owned by a public body or governmental agency and is
used for low-rent housing purposes; or
(ii)    Any contract between the Local Authority and the Government for loans
or annual contributions, or both, in connection with such project remains in
force and effect; or
(iii)    Any bonds issued in connection with such project or any moneys due to
the Government in connection with such project remain unpaid, whichever period
is the longest, the Municipality agrees that it shall not levy or impose any
real or personal property taxes or special assessments upon such project or
upon the Local Authority with respect thereto. During such period, the Local
Authority shall make annual payments (herein called "payments in lieu of
taxes") in lieu of taxes (and special assessments) and in payment for the
public services and facilities from time to time without other cost or charge
for or with respect to such project.
(b)    Each such annual payment in lieu of taxes shall be made after the end of
the fiscal year established for such project, and shall be in an amount equal
to either:
(i)    Ten percent (10%) of the shelter rent charged by the Local Authority in
respect to such project during such fiscal year; or
(ii)    The amount permitted to be paid by applicable State law in effect on
the date such payment is made, whichever amount is the lower.
(c)    The Municipality shall distribute the payments in lieu of taxes among
the taxing bodies in the proportion which the real property taxes which would
have been paid to each taxing body for such year if the project were not exempt
from taxation bears to the total real property taxes which would have been paid
to all of the taxing bodies for such year if the project were not exempt from
taxation; provided, however, that no payment for any year shall be made to any
taxing body in excess of the amount of the real property taxes which would have
been paid to such taxing body for such year if the project were not exempt from
taxation.
4.    The Municipality agrees that, subsequent to the date of initiation (as
defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended) of each project
and within five years after the completion thereof, or such further period as
may be approved by the Government and in addition to the number of unsafe or
insanitary dwelling units which the Municipality is obligated to eliminate as a
part of the low-rent housing project(s) heretoafter undertaken by the Local
Authority, there has been or will be elimination, as certified by the
Municipality, by demolition, condemnation, effective closing or compulsory
repair or improvement, of unsafe or insanitary dwelling units situated in the
locality or metropolitan area in which such project is located, substantially
equal in number to the number of newly constructed dwelling units provided by
such project; provided, that, where more than one family is living in an unsafe
or insanitary dwelling unit, the elimination of such unit shall count as the
elimination of units equal to the number of families accommodated therein; and
provided, further, that this paragraph 4 shall not apply in the case of:
(i)    Any project developed on the site of a slum cleared subsequent to July
15, 1949, and that the dwelling units eliminated by the clearance of the site
of such project shall not be counted as elimination for any other projects or
any other low-rent housing project; or
(ii)    Any project located in a rural nonfarm or Indian area.
5.    During the period commencing with the date of the acquisition of any part
of the site or sites of any project and continuing so long as either:
(i)    Such project is owned by a public body or governmental agency and is
used for low-rent housing purposes; or
(ii)    Any contract between the Local Authority and the Government for loans
or annual contributions, or both, in connection with such project remains in
force and effect; or
(iii)    Any bonds issued in connection with such project or any moneys due to
the Government in connection with such project remain unpaid, whichever period
is the longest, the Municipality without cost or charge to the Local Authority
or the tenants of such project (other than the payments in lieu of taxes)
shall:
(a)    Furnish or cause to be furnished to the Local Authority and the tenants
of such project public services and facilities of the same character and to the
same extent as are furnished from time to time without cost or charge to other
dwellings and inhabitants in the Municipality;
(b)    Vacate such streets, roads and alleys within the area of such project as
may be necessary in the development thereof, and convey without charge to the
Local Authority such interest as the Municipality may have in such vacated
areas; and, insofar as it is lawfully able to do so without cost or expense to
the Local Authority or to the Municipality, cause to be removed from such
vacated areas, insofar as it may be necessary, all public or private utility
lines and equipment;
(c)    Insofar as the Municipality may lawfully do so:
(i)    Grant such deviations from the building codes of the Municipality as are
reasonable and necessary to promote economy and efficiency in the development
and administration of such project, and at the same time safeguard health and
safety; and
(ii)    Make such changes in any zoning of the site and surrounding territory,
of such project as are reasonable and necessary for the development and
protection of such project and the surrounding territory;
(d)    Accept grants of easements necessary for the development of such
project; and
(e)    Cooperate with the Local Authority by such other lawful action or ways
as the Municipality and the Local Authority may find necessary in connection
with the development and administration of such project.
6.    In respect to any project the Municipality further agrees that within a
reasonable time after receipt of a written request therefor from the Local
Authority:
(a)    It will accept the dedication of all interior streets, roads, alleys and
adjacent sidewalks within the area of such project, together with all storm and
sanitary sewer mains in such dedication areas, after the Local Authority, at
its own expense, has completed the grading, improvement, paving and
installation thereof in accordance with specifications acceptable to the
Municipality;
(b)    It will accept necessary dedications of land for, and will grade,
improve, pave and provide sidewalks for, all streets bounding such project or
necessary to provide adequate access thereto (in consideration whereof the
Local Authority shall pay to the Municipality such amount as would be assessed
against the project site for such work if such site were privately owned); and
(c)    It will provide, or cause to be provided, water mains, and storm and
sanitary sewer mains, leading to such project and serving the bounding streets
thereof (in consideration whereof the Local Authority shall pay to the
Municipality such amount as would be assessed against the project site for such
work if such site were privately owned).
7.    If by reason of the Municipality's failure or refusal to furnish or cause
to be furnished any public services or facilities which it has agreed hereunder
to furnish or to cause to be furnished to the Local Authority or to the tenants
of any project, the Local Authority incurs any expense to obtain such services
or facilities, the Local Authority may deduct the amount of such expense from
any payments in lieu of taxes due or to become due to the Municipality in
respect to any project or any other low-rent Housing projects owned or operated
by the Local Authority.
8.    No cooperation agreement heretofore entered into between the Municipality
and the Local Authority shall be construed to apply to any project covered by
this Agreement.
9.    No member of the governing body of the Municipality or any other public
official of the Municipality who exercises any responsibilities or functions
with respect to any project during his tenure or for one year thereafter shall
have any interest, direct or indirect, in any project or any property included
or planned to be included in any project, or any contracts in connection with
such projects or property. If any such governing body member or such other
public official of the Municipality involuntarily acquires or had acquired
prior to the beginning of his tenure any such interest, he shall immediately
disclose such interest to the Local Authority.
10.    So long as any contract between the Local Authority and the Government
for loans (including preliminary loans) or annual contributions, or both, in
connection with any project remains in force and effect, or so long as any
bonds issued in connection with any project or any moneys due to the Government
in connection with any project remain unpaid, this Agreement shall not be
abrogated, changed, or modified without the consent of the Government. The
privileges and obligations of the Municipality hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect with respect to each project so long as the beneficial title
to such project is held by the Local Authority or by any other public body or
governmental agency, including the Government, authorized by law to engage in
the development or administration of low-rent housing projects. If at any time
the beneficial title to, or possession of, any project is held by such other
public body or governmental agency, including the Government, the provisions
hereof shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by, such other public
body or governmental agency, including the Government.

most valuable resource and it is our goal to provide a healthy, satisfying
working environment which promotes personal opportunities for growth. In
meeting these goals, it is our policy to:

personal problems, including alcohol or drug dependency, adversely affect their
ability to perform their duties.
   (b)    Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure worker fitness for
duty and to protect our employees, and the public from the risks posed by the
use of alcohol and prohibited drugs and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol
or drugs.
   (c)    Applicability. This policy applies to all City employees, paid part-
time employees and contractors when they are on City property or when
performing City related business offsite or when in uniform. This policy
applies to off-site lunch periods or breaks when an employee is scheduled to
return to work. Visitors, vendors and contractor employees are governed by this
policy while on transit premises and shall not be permitted to conduct City
business if found to be in violation of this policy.
   (d)    Definitions. The following categories of prohibited substances are
addressed by this policy:
      (1)    "Illegally used controlled substances or drugs" means any illegal
drug or any substance identified in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the
Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), and as further defined by 21 CFR
1300.11 through 1300.15. This includes, but is not limited to marijuana,
amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP) and cocaine, as well as so-called
"designer drugs" not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes
use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs, and use of
illegally obtained prescription drugs.
      (2)    "Legal drugs". The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and
nonprescribed medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance
which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor
skills or judgment may be adversely affected should be reported to supervisory
personnel and medical advice should be sought, as appropriate, before
performing work-related duties.
      (3)    "Alcohol". The use of alcohol-containing beverages or substances
such that alcohol is present in the body while performing City business is
prohibited.
   (e)    Prohibited Conduct.

City premises, in City vehicles, or while on City business shall be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination. Law enforcement shall be
notified, as appropriate, where criminal activity is suspected.
      (2)    Intoxication/under the influence. Any employee who is reasonably
suspected of being intoxicated, impaired or under the influence of a prohibited
substance (such as having a prohibited substance in the body) shall be
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of
condition. Employees found to be under the influence of prohibited substances
or who fail to pass a drug test shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to
and including termination.
      (3)    Compliance with testing requirements. In an effort to maintain a
drug and alcohol-free workplace, all employees shall be subject to urine and
blood alcohol drug testing. Any employee who refuses to comply with a request
for drug testing, who provides false information in connection with a test, or
who attempts to falsify test results through tampering, contamination,
adulteration or substitution shall be terminated for insubordination.
      (4)    Treatment requirements. All employees are encouraged to make use
of the available resources for treatment for substance abuse problems. The City
offers the Employee Assistance Program through the office of Management and
Personnel. Under circumstances employees may be required to undergo treatment
for substance abuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with City's
requirements for treatment, after care, or return to duty shall be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
      (5)    Notifying the Office of Management and Personnel of criminal drug
conviction. Any employee who fails to notify in writing the Office of
Management and Personnel of any criminal drug statute conviction for a
violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such
conviction shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
      (6)    Proper application of the policy. The City is dedicated to
assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy.
Therefore, supervisors/managers are encouraged to use and apply all aspects of
this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who
knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to
deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (f)    Drug Testing. All employees shall be subject to analytical testing of
either urine or blood prior to employment, for reasonable cause, following an
accident, and prior to and after return to duty after failing a drug test and/
or after completion of rehabilitation treatment or as required by Federal
Regulations. To comply with Urban Mass Transit Administration 49 CFR 653.17,
Transit employees who perform UMTA-defined sensitive safety functions shall
also be subject to testing on a random, unannounced basis.
   Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy
and reliability and using techniques and laboratory facilities which have been
approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The City
affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy and confidentiality
throughout the testing process. Personal data regarding the drug testing
program shall be released only to those persons who have a bona fide need to
know the information for proper administration of the anti-drug program.
      (1)    Pre-employment testing. All applicants shall undergo chemical
testing prior to employment. Receipt by the Civil Service Commission of
satisfactory test results is required prior to employment and failure of a drug
test shall disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of 120 days.
Evidence of the absence of drug or alcohol dependency from a substance abuse
treatment provider or other qualified medical or mental health practitioner
shall be required prior to further consideration for employment.
      (2)    Reasonable cause testing. Employees may be subject to a fitness
for duty evaluation, to include appropriate urine and/or blood testing, when
there is reason to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job
performance. A reasonable cause referral for testing shall be made on the basis
of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the
long or short-term effects of substance abuse. Examples of reasonable cause
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.    Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-
the-job behavior;
         B.    Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
         C.    Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited
substances;
         D.    Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.    Fights (to mean physical contact), assaults and flagrant
disregard or violations of established safety, security or other operating
procedures.
Reasonable cause testing determinations shall be made by supervisors who are
trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who
reasonably conclude that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in
his/her work performance due to substance abuse.
      (3)    Post-accident testing. Employees shall be subject to urine and/or
blood testing if they are involved in an accident that results in a fatality,
injuries requiring medical attention, or property damage estimated to be equal
to or greater than four hundred dollars ($400.00).
      (4)    Random testing. Employees in Urban Mass Transit Administration
defined "sensitive safety" positions shall be subjected to random, unannounced
urine testing.
      (5)    Return to duty testing. All employees who previously tested
positive on a drug test shall test negative and be evaluated and released to
duty by the Civil Service Commission review officer before returning to work.
Employees may be subject to monitored random urine testing during the period of
their re-entry contract.
      (6)    Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results
of a required test under subsections (f)(1) through (f)(5) hereof may request
that an additional test be conducted. This test may be conducted at the same or
a different testing laboratory, provided the laboratory is certified by DHHS to
meet 29 CFR Part 40 requirements The testing shall be conducted on the same
specimen originally submitted to the City's laboratory and all costs for such
testing are paid by the employee.
   (g)    Employee Assistance. It is the City's policy to provide assistance to
employees and immediate family members who experience personal problems,
including substance abuse or dependency, which may adversely affect job
performance. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek assistance in dealing
with emotional, physical or mental health problems, including substance abuse.
Confidential professional assistance, treatment planning and rehabilitation
services are available, as needed. In an instance where a management referral
is made, confidentiality means that only the employee assistance program
coordinator and the referring supervisor shall be aware of the circumstances of
the referral.
   A request for assistance for a substance abuse problem shall not, in itself,
be considered grounds for disciplinary action. However, a request for
assistance shall not prevent the taking of appropriate disciplinary actions for
misconduct or performance problems which may be related to substance abuse. In
no case shall participation in the employee assistance program shield employees
who violate this policy from disciplinary action. Employees remain responsible
for their on-the-job conduct and work performance, although assistance for
substance abuse problems may be handled as a separate but related issue.
   (h)    Re-entry Contracts. Employees who re-enter the workforce shall agree
to a re-entry contract. That contract may include, but is not limited to:
      (1)    A release to work statement from an approved treatment specialist.
(The medical review officer shall also approve the employee for return to work
in a sensitive safety position);
      (2)    A negative test for drugs and/or alcohol;
      (3)    An agreement to periodic testing;
      (4)    A statement of expected work-related behaviors; and
      (5)    An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for
termination.
   (i)    Contractors. Contractor organizations that have persons who provide
UMTA-defined sensitive safety functions for the transit system shall adopt an
anti-drug policy which contains the same provisions as this policy with respect
to prohibited conduct and chemical testing. No contractor employee who is in
violation of those policy provisions may work on transit property or provide
sensitive safety services unless they have met return to work requirements.
Contractor personnel may, at the sole discretion of the City, participate in
the City's chemical testing program, with results referred to the contractor's
management for appropriate personnel action.

161.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this chapter.
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Auditor" means the City Auditor.
   (c)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (d)    "Transient guest" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgage in possession, licensee or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liability as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or

or private dining rooms or exhibit sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
      (Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.02  LEVY AND RATE.
   Commencing on February 1, 1971,for the purpose of increasing revenue with
which to meet the needs of the City, there is hereby levied a tax of three
percent on all rents received by a hotel for lodging furnished to transient
guests.
   Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City, or to the
City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the
time of the rent payment. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate
share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be
due upon the transient guest's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any
reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Auditor may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Auditor.
(Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.03  EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
   (a)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
   (b)    Upon rents paid by the State or any of its political subdivisions;
   (c)    Upon rents of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.
   No exemption claimed under subsections (a) or (b) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under
penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Auditor. All claims of
exemption under subsection (c) hereof shall be made in the manner prescribed by
the Auditor.

   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from the rent
and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the occupancy is
arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy or
any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or delivered by
the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as
trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be liable for
the collection thereof and for the tax.
   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.05  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter (January 12,
1971), or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later,
each operator of any hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall register
such hotel with the Auditor and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy
Registration Certificate" to be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on
the premises. Such Certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)    The name of the operator;
   (b)    The address of the hotel;
   (c)    The date upon which the Certificate was issued;
   (d)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Auditor for the purpose of
collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting such
tax to the Auditor. This Certificate does not constitute a permit."
      (Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING; RETURNS TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Auditor, make a return to the Auditor on forms
provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax
collected for transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from tax filed by
occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the
report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected
shall be remitted to the Auditor. The Auditor may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return if
such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Auditor. All
returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated as
confidential by the Auditor and shall not be released by him except upon order
of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United
States, the State of Ohio, the County of Ross, or the City for official use

remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the

shall be added for each successive thirty-day period that the occupant remains
delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Auditor determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.

AUDITOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter the Auditor shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Auditor shall procure such facts and
information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the
Auditor shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally
or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to
the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may
within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in
writing to the Auditor for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by
the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Auditor shall become final
and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made,
the Auditor shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax,
interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed.
After such hearing, the Auditor shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days
unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
161.09.
(Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.09  APPEAL TO MAYOR.

amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Mayor by
filing a notice of appeal with him within fifteen days of the serving or
mailing of the determination of tax due. The Mayor shall fix a time and place
for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such operator at
his last known place of address. The findings of the Mayor shall be final and
conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.10  RECORDS.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of, and payment to,
the City, which records the Auditor shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times.

or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Auditor within three years of the date of payment. The claim
shall be on forms furnished by the Auditor.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Auditor that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest. However, neither a refund nor a credit shall be
allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient
to the operator.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund to taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (whereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Auditor or when the
transient guest having paid the tax to the operator, established to the
satisfaction of the Auditor that the transient guest has been unable to obtain
a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 8-71. Passed 1-12-71.)
161.12 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.

two hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
            (Ord. 65-16. Passed 9-12-16.)
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
163.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
163.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
163.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
163.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records

lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

Section
163.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
163.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the

   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
163.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 163.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
163.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)      (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or anv other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
163.04 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(l)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at anytime.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
163.04 of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 02-24. Passed 1-8-24.)

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
163.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
163.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
163.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
163.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
163.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
163.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the

         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid

(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
163.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.

estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section 163.10 of
this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section

163.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of the City of Chillicothe, Ohio is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipality, he shall receive a credit of the
tax paid to another municipality(s) up to 50% of the amount owed to the City of
Chillicothe, Ohio.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City of Chillicothe,
Ohio, who receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal
service compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of
the City of Chillicothe, Ohio, if it be made to appear that he has paid a
municipal income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another
municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf to such other municipality(s) up
to 50% of the amount owed to the City of Chillicothe, Ohio. The credit shall
not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.

163.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
163.081 of this Chapter. (Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
163.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
163.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
163.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
163.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this

or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
163.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
163.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 163.092 of this Chapter
prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
163.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
163.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
163.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 03-24. Passed 1-8-24.)
         
163.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
City’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the
15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which
the return relates. The taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal extension
request to the municipal income tax return.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return. The
taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal extension request to the municipal
income tax return.
   
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
   (G)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A) through (F) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (G) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.00.
   Section (G) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the Tax Administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (A) of this section.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
163.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
163.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
163.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
163.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
section

163.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right

   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax

statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and
penalties thereon, if any.

163.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
163.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
163.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
163.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
163.99 of this Chapter for a violation of 163.15 of this Chapter, and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
163.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 124-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
163.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
163.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
163.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section 163.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as
provided by division (D) of this section.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as

specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.
hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person's expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of

E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive

in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
               The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term

requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three  consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars

by an alcohol and drug treatment program that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
3793.02, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the program. The purpose of
the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender's alcohol usage and

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent

and affirm the facts it contains and file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If
the
operator of the vehicle is present, the officer also shall record on the ticket
the name of the operator in a space provided on the ticket for identification
of the offender, and then shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the

potentially subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act
or omission resulted in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine,
penalties, fees and costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a
hearing is requested, as if the parking ticket were personally served on both
the owner and operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   
   (c)    The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of

and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)    An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent
for purpose of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance with this
section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator in
accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement and
if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
352.09.
   (e)    Except as provided in Section
352.09, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays any
fines, penalties, fees, and costs imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in the parking infraction.
   (f)    If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant
to Section
352.06, and proceed according to that section, shall result in the imposition
of an additional penalty often dollars ($10.00).
   (g)    The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person, personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fines, penalties, fees and costs,
and any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.

with an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)    A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the

infraction with explanation, he or she shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction

shall be returned to the person; if the fine is eliminated or reduced and the
person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay only the amount
of the revised fine. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the explanation
does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the parking infraction,
the person owes the entire amount of the fine. If a person admits that he
committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person fails to pay the
amount of the fine due within ten days after receiving notice ofthe Hearing
Examiner's determination, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the
Hearing Examiner's determination and the amount of the fine due shall be
considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a judgment rendered

352.07.

evidence in accordance with that subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall
consider all evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the
City has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person committed
the infraction. If the Hearing Officer determines that the person committed the
infraction, an order indicating the determination as a judgment against the
person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fines and any additional
penalties, fees and costs shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) of this section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall,

appropriate fines and any additional penalties, fees and costs. A default
judgment entered under this subsection shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.

Section
352.06 does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of that section,

parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the judgment and

         A.    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one year of the date of entry
of the judgment;
         B.    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose;
         C.    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)    (1)    Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a
person pursuant to this section shall be made to the Parking Violations Bureau

disbursed by the Parking Violations Bureau to the City of Chillicothe, and the
Parking Violations Bureau shall enter the fact of payment of the money and
disbursement in the records ofthe Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment shall be filed
with the office of the Clerk of Courts and when so filed, shall have the same
force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered in the court.
      (2)    Judgments and default judgments filed with the Chillicothe
Municipal Court shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment roll from
other judgments rendered in that court. When a judgment or default judgment is
filed with the court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be
taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid
money judgment in a civil action rendered in that court. The Chillicothe
Municipal Court may assess costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not
exceeding ten dollars for each parking infraction, to be paid upon satisfaction
of the judgment.

requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the court shall schedule a hearing date
and notify the parties of the date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing
shall be held by the court in accordance with the rules of the court. Service
of a notice of appeal under this subsection by a person does not stay
enforcement and collection of the judgment or default judgment from which
appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files the appeal posts bond
with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the judgment, plus court
costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
      (2)    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal
of the Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the
Parking Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Mtmicipal Court
may be taken.

354.01 PURPOSE.
   Specific Findings. The following specific legislative findings of the
Council in support of preferential resident parking are set forth as
illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this chapter. They are
intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual
basis supporting its adoption:
   (a)   The safety, health and welfare of the residents of the City can be
greatly enhanced by the maintenance of the attractiveness, convenience and
livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas;
   (b)   It is a fact of modern living in the City that a large portion of
municipal residents possess automobiles and as a result are daily faced with
the need to store these motor vehicles in or near their residences;
   (c)   Certain neighborhoods and areas of the City do not have sufficient on-
or off-street space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles by
residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes;
   (d)   Such neighborhoods above are often further burdened by influxes of
motor vehicles owned by non-residents which compete for the inadequate
availability of on-street parking spaces;
   (e)   There further exists certain parking “attractors” within the City such
as municipal facilities and business facilities which further exacerbate
resident parking;
   (f)   A system of preferential resident parking as enacted in this chapter
will serve to promote the safety, health and welfare of all the residents of
the City by promoting the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential
living, and the increased use of alternative forms of transportation. The
public welfare will also be served by ensuring a more stable and valuable
property tax base in order to generate the revenues necessary to provide
essential public services.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.

and habits and establish residency in the City. Growing populations of geese,

rivers, and streams, which can cause algae blooms, damage lawns and soil public
areas around said lakes and other wetlands.

pigeons, birds, deer, wild turkeys, raccoons, coyotes, other wild animals such
as feral cats/dogs etc., and other vermin on public lands.

      (4)    "Person." Any individual, corporation, company, partnership, firm,
association, or political subdivision of this state subject to municipal
jurisdiction.

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

535.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Section 715.55 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Council for the City of Chillicothe makes the following
statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of the City in order to protect and preserve the
health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the
businesses as well as the citizens of the City.
      (2)   The City Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the City that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by the City in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by the City are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   The City Council desires to minimize and control these adverse
effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified
manner. And by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the City
Council seeks to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry;
protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life;
preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and
deter the spread of urban blight.
      (7)   The City Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City and that expanded regulation of adult
entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of the City Council in enacting this chapter
to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by
the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of the City Council to condone or legitimize
the distribution of obscene material, and the City Council recognizes that
state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and
expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state
obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this State.
   (b)    It is the intent of the City Council in enacting this chapter to
regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to
promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the
City and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary
effects of adult entertainment establishments within the City. The provisions
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the City Council in
enacting this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize the restriction or
denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of, access by the
distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the City Council in
enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition
of obscene material.
   (c)    Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

from the paper entitled "Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace
Sexual Violence," by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice
Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from "Sexually
Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the
Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other
documentary evidence), and subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of
Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291;
729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and
Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
this Council's independent review of the same the City Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including,
but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential
spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity, including lewd
conduct, masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually
oriented businesses, including those businesses which provide private or semi-
private rooms, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
performances.
      (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is this City's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, this City's interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the City. The City finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
      (4)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the City.

recklessly allowed such act to occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to
liability that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent
the act.

provisions of this chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be
subject to civil abatement proceedings initiated by the City in a court of

sexually oriented business. If the offender touches a specified anatomical area
of the patron or employee, or the clothing covering a specified anatomical

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)    (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06 , or
545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or

545.05  or
545.15 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

Boxing and Wrestling
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Senate Bill 60, effective October 27, 1981, established a
State Boxing Commission in Ohio R.C. 3773.33 to regulate boxing in the State
including any City which pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3773.31(C) did not create or
reaffirm creation of a City Boxing Commission between the effective date of the
Act and April 15, 1982. Chillicothe did not reaffirm the creation of the City
Boxing Commission originally created by Ordinance 280-61, passed May 17, 1961,
thus the State Boxing Commission has jurisdiction to enforce Ohio R.C. 3773.31
to 3773.58 within the City of Chillicothe.

707.09 GRANT OF FRANCHISES.
   (a)    The City may grant a new franchise or a franchise renewal for a
period not to exceed fifteen (15) years to serve the City.
   (b)    The City may make the grant of a new franchise conditioned upon the
completion of construction within a prescribed time or upon the performance of
other specific obligations specifying that failure to timely comply with the
conditions will cause the franchise to become null and void without further
action by the City.
   (c)    In evaluating an application for a new franchise, the City shall
consider the applicant's character; the applicant's technical, financial and
legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature
of the proposed facilities, equipment and services; the applicant's record in
other communities, if any; and whether the proposal will meet anticipated
community needs and serve the public interest. Where an applicant proposes an
overbuild of an existing cable system, the City may also consider the economic
feasibility of multiple cable operators, the impact on the existing franchisee,
including whether the operations of the existing cable franchisee will be
interfered with or disrupted, and whether any adverse consequences to the
public interest will result if the application is granted.
   (d)    Based upon the application, the written and oral testimony and other
material presented at a public hearing before the Council, and any other
information relevant to the application, the Council shall decide whether to
grant or deny a new franchise application.
   (e)    If the Council grants a new franchise application, the Mayor and the
applicant must agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within one hundred
twenty (120) calendar days from the date of the resolution making the grant.
This period may be extended for good cause by the Council. If agreement is not
reached with the Mayor within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days or if the
period is not extended by the Council, the franchise grant may be withdrawn by
the City.
   (f)    The text of a proposed new or renewal franchise agreement must be
made available by the City to the public and advertised in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City at least fourteen (14) days before the
public hearing.
   (g)    After complying with the requirements of subsections (c) to (f)
hereof, the Council shall, following a public hearing, approve or disapprove
the proposed new or renewal franchise agreement by resolution.
   (h)    The grant of an initial franchise or a renewed franchise may be
subject to a franchise acceptance fee in an amount not to exceed ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) less the amount of the filing fee. Within thirty (30)
calendar days of the date of the resolution approving the franchise agreement,
the City must notify the approved applicant of the amount of any franchise
acceptance fee and its method of calculation. If the franchise acceptance fee
is not paid within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Council
resolution approving the franchise agreement, the grant will be null and void.
Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the approved applicant must
demonstrate compliance with the surety, insurance and similar provisions of the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.10 INSURANCE; SURETY; INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)    Unless a franchise agreement specifies otherwise, the following
insurance coverage shall be in force at all times during the franchise period:
workmen's compensation insurance to meet all State requirements; and general
comprehensive liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation
and maintenance of a cable system, including the operation of motor vehicles,

($500,000) for any one person, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) for any one
accident;
      (2)    For property damage, five hundred thousand dollars ($500,00); and
      (3)    For damages resulting from any liability of any nature that may
arise from or be occasioned by operation of the cable system, including any
communication over the cable system, excepting programming on government
channels, one million dollars ($1,000,000).
   (b)    All insurance policies must be with sureties qualified to do business
in Ohio and in a form approved by the Law Director. The City may require in a
franchise agreement coverage and amounts in excess of the above minimums.
   (c)    A franchisee must, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless and defend the City, its officials, boards, commissions, agents and
employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction,
maintenance or operation of its cable system regardless of whether the act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise.
This provision includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of copyright
infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the
owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by
the cable system. This provision excludes the coverage of negligent acts by the
City.
   (d)    The franchise agreement may require the franchisee to have in force
at all times a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount
as necessary to ensure the faithful performance by the franchisee of its
obligation under the franchise agreement. Such performance bond or surety
instruments must be provided by an entity qualified to do business in the State

(Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.11  SECURITY FUND.
   (a)    Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the franchisee may be
required to post with the City a cash security deposit in the minimum amount of
ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or such other amount as specified in the
franchise agreement to be used as a security fund to ensure the faithful
performance of all provisions of law and the franchise agreement and compliance
with all orders, permits and directions of the City, and the payment by the
franchisee of any claims, liens or taxes due the City which arise by reason of
the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
   (b)    The City shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing
account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee but may not
be withdrawn; all interest will be added to and become part of the original
security fund during the term of the franchise.
   (c)    If a franchisee fails to pay the City any fees or taxes due,
liquidated damages, damages, or costs or expenses incurred by the City by
reason of any act or default of the franchisee, or if the franchisee fails to
comply with any provision of the franchise agreement that the City reasonably
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security fund, the City
may, after ten (10) calendar days notice to the franchisee, withdraw that
amount with any interest from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the City
shall notify the franchisee of the amount and date of the withdrawal.
   (d)    Within thirty (30) calendar days after notice to it that an amount
has been withdrawn by the City from the security fund, the franchisee must
deposit a sum of money sufficient to restore the security fund to the original
amount. If the franchisee fails to restore the security fund to the original
amount within thirty (30) calendar days, the entire security fund remaining may
be forfeited, and/or such failure may be considered a material breach of this
chapter and may be grounds for revocation of the franchise.
   The security fund will become the property of the City in the event the
franchise is revoked. The franchisee is entitled to the return of the security
fund that remains following termination of the franchise, provided that there
is no outstanding default or unpaid amounts owed to the City by the franchisee.
   (f)    The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights of the City whether reserved by this chapter or
authorized by other laws, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to such security fund will affect any other right the City may have.

707.12 MINIMUM FACILITIES AND SERVICES.
   (a)    The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply

      (1)    A cable system constructed or rebuilt after the effective date of
this section must have a minimum capacity of fifty-four (54) video channels
available for immediate or potential use and have the capability for two-way
communications.
      (2)    A cable system must provide at least one access channel for
public, educational or governmental access. However, the City may require a
franchisee to reserve additional channels for future access use. If the City
determines that the use of existing access facilities warrants the activation
of such reserve channels, the franchisee shall activate them upon ninety (90)
days notice from the City. The City may require the franchisee to contribute to
capital costs for access studios and related equipment and facilities.
      (3)    A cable system must provide leased access channels as required by

      (4)    Service to public buildings may be required without charge as set
forth in the franchise agreement.
   (b)    Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a franchisee must
make cable service available to every unserved dwelling within the franchise
service area. Where the franchise service area is the entire City, the
franchisee shall extend service to any annexed areas within six (6) months of
the date of annexation; provided, however, the franchisee is not required to
extend service in areas where the cable would pass fewer than thirty (30) homes
per cable mile, as measured from the franchisee's nearest trunk line.
   (c)    The City may waive minimum requirements of this section where such
waiver is justified in the public interest.
(Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.13  FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)    Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a franchisee, in

file with the City within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each calendar
quarter a financial statement showing the gross revenues received by the

franchisee, relating to the operation of the cable system, and recompute any
amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. The cost of the audit
will be borne by the franchisee if the annual payment to the City is increased
by more than five percent (5%) as a result of the audit.
   (f)    In the event that a franchise payment is not received by the City on
or before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at an
interest rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month. Interest will not
be imposed for any payment necessary as a result of the yearly adjustment
provided for in subsection (b) hereof, if the payment to correct for a
shortfall does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total payments made during
the year. In the event such payment exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total
payments made during the year, the franchisee will be liable for interest for
the entire amount due. Franchisee will also be liable for interest on the
entire shortfall if more than one quarterly payment is ten percent (10%) or
more short.
   (g)    When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the franchisee must
file with the City within ninety (90) calendar days of the date its operations
cease an audited financial statement showing the gross revenues received by the
franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments shall be made
at that time for franchise fees due to the date that the franchisee's
operations ceased.

facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed.
(Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.16  DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED.
   (a)    Unless approved by the City and to the extent consistent with federal

damage or disturbance to public thoroughfares or private property as a result
of its construction or operations and must restore to their former condition

consideration, a copy of which recommendations shall be made available to the
franchisee in advance of the Council's consideration. Following the public
hearing on the renewal application, the Council must either:
      (1)    Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the
negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the City and the
franchisee, or
      (2)    Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed.
   (d)    The Council's action under subsection (c) hereof must be taken within
four (4) months of the date of the renewal application notice to the franchisee
required in subsection (a)(2) hereof.

and the public shall have thirty (30) calendar days to comment on the
recommended decision after its issuance.
   (g)    Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments
presented, and other evidence of record, the Council, following a public
hearing, shall make a final determination on whether to grant or deny the
renewal application. The Council shall issue a written decision setting forth
the reasons for its decision.

franchisee may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise in accordance with
47 U.S.C. 546(h). The City must hold one or more public hearings or implement
other procedures under which comments on the proposal from the public may be
received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the Council shall
determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions
of any renewal.
   (i)    Once the Council grants a renewal application, the City and the
franchisee must agree on a franchise agreement before the renewal becomes
effective.
   (j)    If renewal of a franchise is denied, the City may acquire ownership
of the cable system or effect a transfer to ownership of the system to another
person upon approval of the Council. Any such acquisition by the City must be
at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a
going concern.
   (k)   If renewal of a franchise is denied, and the City does not purchase

facilities and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the City may have the removal done at the former
franchisee's and/or surety's expense.

707.22  TRANSFERS.
   (a)    A transfer of a franchise must not occur without prior approval of
the City.
   (b)    An application to transfer a franchise must provide complete
information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal,
character, financial, technical and other pertinent qualifications of the
transferee. At minimum, the information required in Section
707.08(e)(1) to (4) must be provided by the proposed transferee. The
information required in Section
707.08(e)(5) to (10) must also be provided whenever the proposed transferee
expects material changes to occur in those areas.
   (c)    Final action on an application for transfer of a franchise must be
taken by the Council within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the
filing of the application for transfer of the franchise. Council shall approve
the transfer of the franchise unless Council determines that the proposed
transferee fails to possess sufficient financial resources and expertise to
operate the franchise or Council determines that the proposed transferee will
not accept all material terms and conditions of the franchise then in existence
or as modified by mutual agreement between the City and transferee. Failure by
Council to act within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days automatically
approves the proposed transfer.
   (d)    Approval by the City of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this chapter or the
franchise agreement.
   (e)    The City may impose a grant fee to cover its costs in considering an
application for transfer of a franchise of up to ten thousand dollars
($10,000), less the franchise transfer filing fee.
(Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.23  REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)    A franchise may be revoked by Council for failure to construct as
required, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or
the franchise agreement or for other material breach of this chapter or the
franchise agreement. However, where the City has issued a franchise
specifically conditioned upon the completion of construction or other specific
obligation by a specified date pursuant to Section
707.09(b), failure of the franchisee to complete construction or comply with
other specific obligation as required will result in the automatic forfeiture
of the franchise without further action by the City, unless the City, at its
discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an
extension of time. If within thirty (30) calendar days following written notice
from the City to the franchisee that it is in material breach of this chapter
or the franchise agreement, the franchisee has not taken corrective action or
corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the Council,
acting on its own motion or upon the recommendation of the Mayor, may give
written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation of the
franchise, stating its reasons.
   (b)    Before final action can be taken, the Council shall hold a public
hearing at which time the franchisee and members of the public must be given an
opportunity to present evidence and make argument. Following the public hearing
the Council shall determine whether or not to revoke the franchise based on any
recommended decision, the evidence and argument presented at the hearing, and
other evidence of record. The Council's determination shall be reflected in a
written opinion setting forth the reasons for its decision.
   (c)    Any franchise may, at the option of the City, be revoked one hundred
twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or
the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the
franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that
one hundred twenty (120) day period:
      (1)    Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)    Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by the court having jurisdiction, assuming and
agreeing to be bound by the terms, and conditions of the franchise.
   (d)    In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the City may revoke the
franchise by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at
the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the
franchise will be revoked thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice,
unless:
      (1)    The City has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
      (2)    The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (e)    If the City revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a
franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:
      (1)    The City may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the City may have the removal done at the
franchisee's and/or surety's expense.
      (2)    The City, by resolution of the City Council, may acquire ownership
of the cable system at a fair market value.
      (3)    If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the City may sell,
assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.
         (Ord. 75-89. Passed 6-26-89.)
707.24 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
   (a)    It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services
from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the
franchisee are satisfied.
   (b)    In the event of a termination of the franchise for whatever reason,
the franchisee must do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers
receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The
franchisee must cooperate with the City to operate the system for a temporary
period following termination as necessary to maintain continuity of service to
all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six (6) months without
the franchisee's written consent. During such period the cable system must be
operated under such terms and conditions as the City and the franchisee may
agree, or such other terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent
possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide
reasonable compensation to the cable operator.
   (c)    If the franchisee discontinues service to all of its subscribers for
a continuous period of ninety-six (96) hours without City approval, the
franchise may immediately be terminated, and the City is empowered to occupy
and take possession of all facilities and property, real and personal, related
to the cable system for the purpose of temporarily operating the system. The
City may undertake such operation itself or authorize operation by a
contractor.

thing of value, for the purpose of influencing the grant, modification,
renewal, transfer or any other matter affecting a franchise or the
administration or enforcement of this chapter.

misdemeanor of the first degree.

proposals for the provision of public educational and governmental access
channels sufficient to meet community needs during term of franchise as
determined by the City. A franchisee or applicant shall specify what grants, if
any, it is willing to make for studio equipment and facilities to be used for
local program production by all cable access users.
   (b)    All access channel operators must conform to the following minimum
requirements:
      (1)    The City may require that a franchisee provide studio space for
access use. Access channels shall be carried on the franchisee's lowest priced
service offering.
      (2)    The franchisee shall have no control over the content of the
programming carried on access channels. The City may require a franchisee, or
select a nonprofit corporation or other entity, to manage the access channels
consistent with the requirements of this chapter, the franchise agreement and
the intended purpose of such channels.
      (3)    The use of any public access channel shall be made available to
any City resident on a nondiscriminatory basis at no charge for channel use.
Where access studio facilities are located on a franchisee's premises, the
franchisee shall make its personnel available for consultation and assistance
to access users for a reasonable fee provided that such personnel can be spared
from their normal duties.
   (c)    During the hours the access channel(s) are not being programmed by
the City or other qualified users pursuant to the terms and conditions in

may substitute other programming on such channel(s).

707.27 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
   (a)    Every two (2) years during the franchise term, the City may evaluate
the performance of a franchisee pursuant to this section. The first such
performance evaluation may be conducted on the first anniversary of the
effective date of a franchise agreement. A franchisee shall cooperate fully
with these evaluations and supply the City with all relevant information
requested. If the City desires to implement a written survey of subscribers in
connection with its evaluation of service, a franchisee shall distribute the
City's questionnaire to its subscribers. Franchisee and the City shall
cooperate fully in the development of such questionnaire. The subscriber
questionnaire shall meet the billstuffer specifications of the franchisee.
Reasonable notice shall be given to the franchisee to ensure that the
questionnaire may be inserted in the franchisee's billing statements. If
franchisee and City agree, such subscriber survey may be conducted via
telephone interviews with a statistically valid sampling of subscribers. Any
meetings between the City and the franchisee for purposes of evaluation shall
be publicized in advance and open to the public.
   (b)    If evaluation indicates the need for modification to the franchise
agreement, the Mayor shall attempt to negotiate the necessary changes. The
Mayor shall issue a report to the Council of the results of the performance
evaluation and any recommended changes to the franchise agreement as negotiated
with the franchisee.
   (c)    The Council may hold a public hearing on any performance evaluation
reports. Any franchise agreement modifications must be approved by the Council

733.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Section 715.55 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Council makes the following statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of the City in order to protect and preserve the
health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the
businesses as well as the citizens of the City.
      (2)   The Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the City that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by the City in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by the City are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   The Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects
by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner. And
by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the Council seeks to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens
from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of
urban blight.
      (7)   The Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City and that expanded regulation of adult
entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of the Council in enacting this chapter to
suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of the Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and the Council recognizes that state and
federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and
encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes
against any such illegal activities in this state.
   (b)   It is the intent of the Council in enacting this chapter to regulate
in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and
establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects
of adult entertainment establishments within the City. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the Council in enacting
this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize the restriction or denial of,
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of, access by the distributors
and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the Council in enacting this
chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene
material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings

Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other
documentary evidence), and subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of
Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291;
729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and
Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
the Council's independent review of the same the Council finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments.
      (2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Section 2907.25 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the State.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982,
and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   The findings noted in subsections (c)(1) to (14) raise substantial
governmental concerns.
      (16)   Adult entertainment establishments have operational
characteristics that require or mandate reasonable government regulation in
order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City.

Section
733.10 (a) above shall be considered an affirmance of the denial, suspension,
or revocation of the license and the applicant may pursue an appeal to Ross
County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506. This appeal
provision is intended to comply with the requirement for prompt judicial review
stated by the United States Supreme Court in Township of Littleton, Colorado v.
Z. J. Gifts D-4 (2004), 541 U.S. 774.
   (b)   Any licensee lawfully operating a sexually oriented business prior to

time required for the court to rule on the appeal pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof.
   (c)   Any licensee lawfully acting as an employee in a sexually oriented
business prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, shall retain said license and all
privileges attendant thereto, subject to all other terms of this chapter, so
that the status quo of the licensee is maintained during the pendency of an
appeal and during the entire time required for the court to rule on the appeal
pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)   In the event that any judicial review of the denial of a new or
renewal license application or the revocation or suspension of a license is
still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of any license, the
licensee may file a renewal license application with the Chillicothe Police
Department or its designee pursuant to this chapter. In the event that an
application for renewal of a license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial
review of that denial, the City has the right to consolidate such review with
any pending judicial actions in regards to the previous denial, suspension or
revocation of a license.
   (e)   If, during the pendency of any appeal pursued under subsection (a)

911.14 GARAGE CONNECTIONS.
   No owner of any automobile garage shall connect with any sanitary sewer for
the purpose of using the same as a drain or catch basin in washing or cleaning
automobiles or other vehicles. The owner of the automobile garage or persons
operating the same may make application to the Utilities Director to connect
with a sanitary sewer for the purposes aforesaid and submit therewith their
plans and specifications of connecting and using such sewer; in which event the
Director may, if he is of the opinion that the connections with and use of said
sanitary sewer, according to the plans and specifications submitted, will not
damage the sewer, grant the owner of the automobile garage or persons operating
the same, a permit to connect with and use the sanitary sewer according to the
plans and specifications or according to such other plans and specifications as
may be required by the Director. In that event the owner of
the automobile garage or persons operating the same may connect with and use
the sanitary sewer according to the plans and specifications and manner
designated by the Director. It shall be unlawful thereafter to connect with or
alter the connections or use the sanitary sewer in a manner other than that
designated by the Director.
   It shall be the duty of the Director to examine all present connections of
sanitary sewers by automobile garages or persons operating the same and if in
his opinion, the use of connections is detrimental to the sanitary sewer, he
may require the use to be changed or altered in such a manner as he may specify
or may require the discontinuance of the use of the sanitary sewer for the
purposes as aforesaid entirely, and require the garage to be disconnected
therefrom in which event the owner and persons operating the automobile garage
shall conform to and obey the orders.

911.16 PRETREATMENT.
911.16.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   Sections
911.16  to
911.16.33  set forth uniform requirements for dischargers into the publicly
owned treatment works (POTW) of the City of Chillicothe deemed necessary by the
Director to pretreat discharges into the system.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.02 LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (a)    National Categorical Pretreatment Standards: Federal categorical
pretreatment standards as promulgated by the U. S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the
national categorical pretreatment standards may be considered for submittal to
the Regional Administrator by the City, when the City's wastewater treatment
system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR
403.7.
   (b)    State Requirements: State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by an dischargers which are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations or those in this chapter or any other applicable ordinance.
   (c)    Right of Revision: The City reserves the right to amend this chapter
to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in Section
911.01 . The City of Chillicothe, Ohio may, when necessary, include Best
Management Practices in industrial user permits as an enforceable limitation
(s). In such instances the industrial user shall submit, upon request
documentation indicating compliance with BMPs.
   (d)    Dilution: No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this section.
   (e)    Supplementary Limitations: No discharger shall discharge or cause or
allow to be discharged into the sewerage system any pollutant in concentrations
above those specifically permitted in wastewater discharge permits issued by
the Authority. Wastewater discharge permits shall impose maximum discharge
concentration limits or mass based limits where appropriate. In the absence of
such pollutants, except as such pollutants may occur, and only in
concentrations such pollutants may occur, in normal domestic sewage: Arsenic,
Cadmium, Chromium Hexavalent, Total Chromium, Copper, Cyanide, Lead, Mercury,
Nickel, Selenium, Silver and Zinc.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.03 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (a)    Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this section.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the Authority for review, and shall be
approved by the Authority before construction of the facility. Each existing
discharger shall complete its plan and submit same to the Authority within
three months of discovery and notification by the Authority. No discharger who
discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid date shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge protection procedures
have been approved by the Authority. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the Authority shall not relieve the discharger from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)    New Significant Industrial Users will be evaluated for the need to
develop a Slug Discharge Control Plan within one year of being designated a
Significant Industrial User. The Authority wilt notify the User that a Slug
Discharge Control Plan is required. For the purposes of this subsection, a Slug
Discharge is any discharge of a non-routine episodic nature, including but not
limited to an accidental spill, a non-customary batch discharge, which has the
reasonable potential to cause Interference or Pass Through, or in any other way
violate the Authority's or POTW's regulations, local limits or permit
conditions. All existing Significant Industrial Users will be evaluated for the
need to develop a Slug Discharge Control plan prior to renewing a discharge
permit. Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Authority or
POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a Slug
Discharge. If the Authority or POTW decides that a Slug Control plan is needed,
the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)    Description of discharge, including non-routine batch dischargers;
      (2)    Description of any stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Authority or POTW of Slug
Discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under
Section 403.5(b) of the Act with procedure for follow up written notification
within five days;
      (4)    Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills,
including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
controlling toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and other measures
and equipment for emergency response.
   (c)    The permitted user shall notify the Authority or POTW immediately
upon the discharge of a slug load. The notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume. The notification
should report any corrective actions that were taken by the permitted user. A
written detailed report shall be submitted within five days of the discharge
event and shall include the following:
      (1)    Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)    Description of any stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Authority or POTW of Slug
Discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under
section 403.5(b) of the Act with procedures for follow-up written notification
within five days;
      (4)    Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills,
including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response.
   
   (d)    No discharger shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into
the sewerage system any pollutant in concentrations above those specifically
permitted in wastewater discharge permits issued by the Authority.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.04 CHARGES AND FEES.

(in gallons)              Permit Fee
0       to 7,500          $25.00
7,500   to 75,000         $50.00
75,000  to 375,.000       $100.00
375,000 to 750,000        $150.00
750,000 to 3,750,000      $200.00
Over 3,750,000            $400.00
 
   (b)    Major Significant Industrial Users: The Utilities Director shall
assess a fee between four hundred dollars ($400.00) and one thousand dollars
($1,000) based upon an evaluation taking into account the volume of water
consumption and reasonable potential to adversely affect the POTW treatment
plant.
      (Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.08 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (a)    Compliance Date Report: Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set
forth in this chapter or ninety days following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger subject to this chapter the
discharger shall submit to the Authority a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not what additional 0 & M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the discharger and certified to by a qualified
professional engineer.
   (b)    Periodic Compliance Reports:
      (1)    Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the
Authority, shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently by the Authority a report indicating
the nature and concentration, or prohibited or regulated substances in the
effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition,
this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported in subsection (a)
hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided
however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Authority may
accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.
The Authority, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may
authorize the submission of such reports on months other than those specified
above.
      (2)    Reports of permitted users shall contain all results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where required by the Authority. The
frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard of this chapter. All analyses shall be
performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis
Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of U.S. EPA.
         (Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.09 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)    Each (major significant industrial user) discharger shall provide and
operate at the discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the
Authority. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's
premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the discharger, the Authority may concur with the facility being
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility
is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (b)    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
   (c)   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by
discharger.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.10 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (a)   The Authority may inspect the monitoring facilities of any discharger
to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger
shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection,
sampling or records examination. The Authority shall have the right to set up
on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
   (b)   Sampling Procedures:
      (1)   Composite Sampling: It is recommended that influent and effluent
operational data may be obtained through 24-hour flow proportional composite
samples. Sampling may be done manually or automatically and discretely or
continuously. If discrete sampling is employed, at least 12 aliquots should be
composited. Discrete sampling may be flow proportioned either by varying the
time interval between each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot. All
composites should be flow proportional to either the stream flow at the time of
collection of the influent aliquot or to the total influent flow since the
previous influent aliquot. Volatile pollutant aliquots must be combined in the
laboratory immediately before analysis.
   Effluent sample collection need not be delayed to compensate for hydraulic
detention unless the POTW elects to include detention time compensation or
unless the Approval Authority requires detention time compensation. The
Approval Authority may require that each effluent sample is taken approximately
one detention time tater than the corresponding influent sample when failure to
do so would result in an unrepresentative portrayal of actual POTW operation.
The detention period should be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The
average daily flow should in turn be based on the average of the daily flows
during the same month of the previous year.
      (2)   Grab Samples: If composite sampling is not an appropriate
technique, grab samples should be taken to obtain influent and effluent
operational data. A grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period
of time not exceeding 15 minutes. The collection of influent grab samples
should precede the collection of effluent samples by approximately one
detention period except that where the detention period is greater than 24
hours such staggering of the sample collection may not be necessary or
appropriate. The detention period should be based on a 24-hour average daily
flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based upon the average of
the daily flows during the same month of the previous year. Grab sampling
should be employed where the pollutants being evaluated are those, such as
cyanide and phenol, which may not be held for an extended period because of
biological, chemical or physical interaction which take place after sample
collection and affect the results.
      (3)   All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or any other test
procedures approved by the Administrator (Part 136.4 and 136136.5). Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with techniques approved by the Administrator.
Whereas 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling and analytical techniques for
pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using
validated analytical methods or other sampling and analytical procedures
including procedures suggested by the Authority or other parties approved by
the Administer.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.11 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    Information and data furnished to the Authority with respect to the
nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Authority that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary
information of the discharger.
   (b)    When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, State disposal system
permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions
of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing
the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized
as confidential information. Information accepted by the Authority as
confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the
general public by the Authority until and unless a ten day notification is
given to the discharger.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.12 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   The Authority may for good cause shown suspend the wastewater treatment
service and the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to
the Authority that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an
imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial
danger to the environment, interferes with the operation of the POTW, violates
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter or any wastewater discharge
permit issued pursuant to this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
suspension of the Authority's wastewater treatment service and/or the
discharger's wastewater discharge permit shall, within a reasonable period of
time as determined by the Authority, cease all discharges. In the event of
failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order
within the specified time, the Authority shall commence judicial proceedings
immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with such order.
The Authority shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the
wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof
by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or
conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth
above.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.13 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The Authority may revoke the permit of any discharger which fails to
factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge; reports significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics; refuses reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the Authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
or violates the conditions of its permit, or this chapter or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.14 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION; ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENT.
   Whenever the Authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
which justifies revocation of a wastewater discharge permit, pursuant to
Section
911.16.13 , the Authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such
discharger a written notice either personally or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.
Within thirty days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall
respond personally or in writing to the Authority, advising of its position
with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary establish a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 10-13-14.)
911.16.15 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   Where the violation of Section
911.16.13  is not corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative
adjustment, the Authority may order any discharger which causes or allows
conduct prohibited by Section
911.16.13 , to show cause before the Authority or its duly authorized
representative, why the proposed permit revocation action should not be taken.
A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service,
certified or registered, return receipt requested, specifying the time and
place of a hearing to be held by the Authority or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed

911.16.32 FATS, OILS and GREASE ABATEMENT (FOG).
   (a)    Scope and Purpose. The objective of this section is to set forth
uniform requirements and guidelines for preventing the introduction and
accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into the municipal wastewater system
that will cause or contribute to sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions.
Food Service Establishments (FSE) and other industrial or commercial
establishments generating wastewater containing fats, oils, and greases are
subject to this chapter. This section will regulate such uses by requiring that
grease interceptors and other approved strategies be installed, implemented and
maintained in accordance with the provisions within.
   (b)    Grease Interceptor Installation.
      (1)    Following the effective date of this section, all new FSE
facilities operating within the City of Chillicothe, Ohio shall have grease
interceptors. These interceptors will comply with the requirements of Chapter 9
(4101:2-56-69 OAC).
      (2)    Any FSE in operation on or before the effective date of this
section, or for a period of 90 days prior thereto or for which a building
permit has been purchased, approved and is currently under construction and is
without a grease interceptor, shall be required to install a grease interceptor
at the time of facility renovation, change of ownership, or within two years of
the adoption of this ordinance, whichever comes first.
      (3)    Any new grease interceptor installation must obtain a Permit-To-
Install (PTI) from the Ohio EPA prior to construction, unless the new
installation meets an exemption from the PTI rule as specified in (OAC 3745-42-
02).
      (4)    New grease interceptor installations shall include a sampling
manhole. The sampling manhole will be placed as close to the discharge side of
the interceptor as practical. The design, location, and proposed installation
site shall be reviewed and approved by the Authority.
      (5)    Grease interceptors may be required in non-cooking establishments,
cold dairy and frozen food product establishments, and other industrial or
commercial establishments when the establishments generate wastewater
containing fats, oils or grease, and the Authority determines that an
interceptor is necessary to prevent contributions or accumulations of grease to
the sanitary sewer collection and treatment systems.
   (c)    General Maintenance and Operations.
      (1)    Wastewater discharged to the FSE grease interceptors shall not
exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit at the point of entrance to the interceptor.
Grease concentrations shall not exceed 75 mg/1 at a sampling point located
nearest the interceptor's discharge to the sanitary sewer. Compliances with
this discharge limit shall be determined by laboratory analysis. (EPA Hexane
Extraction Method HEM 1664).
      (2)    Grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated
waste content as required to maintain minimum design capacity or the effective
volume of the grease interceptor. At no time shall the frequency of service
exceed 90 days or as allowed by a valid FOG program modification, as defined in
Section
911.16.32 (e). Users who are required to install grease interceptor shall:
         A.   Install and maintain a grease interceptor that complies with
(Chapter 4101:2-56-69 OAC).
         B.   Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid
materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes,
towels, and rags etc., which could settle into the soils blanket and there by
reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor.
         C.   Operate and maintain the grease interceptor to achieve and
maintain an applicable action level. Applicable shall mean the compliance with
any regulatory narrative or numeric value establish by the Authority.
      (3)    Contracted service providers maintaining grease interceptors
within the City of Chillicothe, Ohio, shall be registered with the Ross County
Department of Environmental Health, and obtain a permit from the Authority.
      (4)    When servicing grease interceptors within the City of Chillicothe,
Ohio, all service providers must have, in their possession, the proper permit
as issued by the Authority.
      (5)    The use of biological or other additives as grease degradation or
conditioning agents is permissible only upon prior written permission granted
by the Authority.
      (6)    The User shall maintain a written record on the current form
issued by the Authority, of all grease interceptor maintenance for three years.
All such records must be available for inspection by the Authority at all
times. These records shall include:
         A.   FSE name and physical location
         B.   Date of grease interceptor service
         C.   Time of grease interceptor service
         D.   Name of contract service provider company
         E.   Name and signature of service provider company representative

disposal.
         J.   The date and signature of FSE personnel confirming service
completion.
         K.   Any additional information that may be required by the Authority.
      (7)    No flow discharge from non-grease laden surfaces may be connected
to sewer lines intended for the grease interceptor.
      (8)    FSE will incorporate, where applicable, BMPs into their kitchen
management strategy to reduce the occurrence of FOG discharges to the sanitary
sewer system.
      (9)    The owner of the property on which the common grease interceptor
has been installed shall be primarily responsible for the maintenance, upkeep
and repair of the common interceptor.
   (d)    Cost Recovery. Any User who discharges or places into the City of
Chillicothe, Ohio sanitary sewer system any substance or material that causes a
partial or total obstruction or blockage is required to reimburse the City of
Chillicothe, Ohio for any costs incurred in responding to the obstruction or
blockage, and any cost mitigating any damage to the City of Chillicothe, Ohio
sanitary sewer system. The cost may be pro-rated to more than one User if more
than one User contributed to the obstruction or blockage.
   A User who knowingly violates this section may be subject enforcement
action, and civil penalties as allowed by Section
911.99 .
   (e)    Request for Modification. The User may request a modification to the

913.01 SEWER ASSESSMENT.
   There is levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or
premises having any sewer connection with the sanitary sewerage system of the
City or otherwise discharging sewerage, liquid wastes, water or other liquids,
either directly or indirectly into the City sewerage system, a sewerage charge
or rental payable as hereinafter provided, and in an amount determinable as set
forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-50. Passed 9-25-50.)
913.02  SERVICE CHARGE AND SURCHARGE.
   A sewage service charge and a sewer service surcharge is hereby established:
   (a)   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated within or
without the City and having any connection with the City sanitary sewerage
system or otherwise discharging sewerage, liquid wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the City sewerage system, and
which lot, parcel of land, building or premises receives all of the water used
in or on such lot, parcel of land, building or premises from the Division of
Water, such sewerage charges or rentals shall be based upon the quantity of
water used thereon or therein and shall be in an amount equal to the charge per
100 cubic feet based on water meter readings for the water used or metered to
the lot, parcel of land, building or premises, with a minimum sewer service
charge and shall be established as set forth in Ordinance 23-00 and shall be
posted and made available to the public at the Utilities Department located at
35 South Paint Street, Chillicothe, Ohio. The Utilities Department shall
provide a copy of said rates upon request by any person at cost.
   (b)    In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises, discharging
sewerage, liquid waste, water or other liquids into the City sewerage system,
either directly or indirectly, does not receive all of the water used in or on
such lot, parcel of land, building or premises from the Division of Water, and
all of the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a City water meter,
or a meter acceptable to the Director of Utilities, then, in each such case,
the amount of water used which is not so metered shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the Director in order to determine the sewer service or rental
charge, and as further set out below. When the total amount of water used
thereon or therein is determined by the Director, such sewerage service charge
or rental shall be an amount equal to the charge per 100 cubic feet in sewer
service charges based on water readings as set out in the schedule in
subsection (a) hereof that would have been charged by the Division of Water
under the schedule of rates applicable thereto, had all the water so determined
to have been used thereon or therein been furnished by the Division of Water.
      Per Capita Rate
      Homes:    50 gallons per person per day
      Business:    75 gallons per person per day for the time open each day
 
EXAMPLES are as follows:
      HOME
Family of five
5 x 50 gal. per person = 250 gal. per day
250 x 90 days = 22,500 gal.
22,500 div 750 = 3000 cu. ft.
3000 cu. ft. x .50 = $15.00
       BUSINESS
100 person capacity open 4 hours per day
100 x 75 gal. div. 1/6 of day = 1250 gal.
1250 gal. x 90 days - 112,500 gal.
112,500 gal. div 750 gal. - 15,000 cu. ft.
15,000 cu. ft. x.50=$75.00
   (c)    In cases falling, within the classification mentioned in subsection
(b) hereof, where the Director finds it impractical to attempt to measure the
water used in or on the lot, parcel of land, building or premises in question
by meter, he may determine the amount of water so used for the purpose of
calculating the sewer service charge or rental by such method as he may find
practicable in light of the conditions and attendant circumstances of the
particular use.
   (d)    In all cases where the premises involved uses water purchased from
the City, which is metered separately and which is not discharged into the
sanitary sewer system of the City or which uses water provided by privately
owned wells and which is not discharged into the sanitary sewer system then, in
such cases, the rates levied by this section shall not apply to such water. If
a portion of the metered or unmetered water is discharged to the sanitary sewer
the Director may determine the amount of water so used for the purpose of
calculating the sewer service charge or rental by such method as he may find
practicable in the light of the conditions and attendant circumstances of the
particular case.
   (e)    In every case when an existing or proposed user desires to discharge
to the City's sewerage system a waste of greater than the hereinafter defined
strength of normal sewage, the City shall determine:
      (1)    To refuse to accept the waste for treatment; or
      (2)    Require pretreatment by the user to a strength of normal sewage;
or
      (3)    To accept and treat the waste for the following stated surcharge.
   No provision of this section shall prohibit any special agreements with
users, as may be determined to be desirable by the City, for purposes such as
equalizing of flow, time of waste treatment, accepting special wastes, etc. All
such special agreements shall be governed by the provisions and rates as set
forth in this section.
   (f)    A sewer service surcharge shall be applied when either or both the
total suspended solids and B.O.D. of a water or waste accepted for admission to
the City sewage works exceeds the values of these constituents for normal
sewage. The excess concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall
be evaluated volumetrically in terms of normal sewage and be subject to
surcharge on the volume as derived in accordance with the following formula:
 
Cs = (Bc x B + Sc x S) Vu x 8.345 x 10 -3
 
Cs = Surcharge in dollars
Bc = Unit cost for B.O.D. in dollars per lb of B.O.D.
B = Strength of B.O.D. in wastewater in excess of
Normal Domestic Strength Waste.
Sc = Unit cost for suspended solids in dollars per lb of
suspended solids.
S = Strength of suspended solids in wastewater in
excess of Normal Domestic Strength Waste.
Vu = Total Vol Discharge by user in 1000 of gals.
General Assumption Accepted by EPA:
(40% of Budget is for Volume)
(30% of Budget is for B.O.D.)
(30% of Budget is for S. S. )
   (Ord. 117-04. Passed 12-27-04.)
913.03 OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING WASTES.
   (a)    The owner shall be responsible for all measurements of flow of wastes
discharged to the sanitary sewer system, except where water meter readings are
employed. The method of measurement shall be subject to the approval of the
Utilities Director. The City and the Director shall have access at all times to
such measuring or metering facilities for the purpose of checking and
determining the accuracy of such measuring devices.
   (b)    Where a sewer service surcharge is applicable the owner shall be
responsible for and perform all necessary analytical work. Analytical methods
shall conform to the Standard Methods of Water and Sewage Analysis of the
American Public Health Association, latest edition. Frequency of sampling and
analysis as well as compositing of samples shall be as directed by the
Director. Copies of analytical results shall be submitted monthly to the
Director and to the State Department of Health. The City reserves the right to
secure samples and make check analysis of the waste and to adjust the surcharge
accordingly.
(Ord. 75-73. Passed 8-27-73.)
913.04 PAYMENT.
   The sewer service charge or rental provided in this chapter shall be payable
at such times as water charges are payable for the respective premises for
which the charge or rental is made and in cases where no water is furnished by
the Division of Water to the lot, parcel of land, building or premises for
which a sewer service charge or rental is made, the charge or rental shall be
payable at such times as shall be determined by the Director of Utilities.
   The Director is authorized to make and enforce such bylaws and regulations,
not in conflict with the terms of this chapter, as may be necessary for

shall be subject to the same rate of discount for prompt payment and the same
rate of interest for delayed payment as now or hereafter may apply in the case
of water bills.
   Any water and sewer bill totaling less than two dollars ($2.00) within a
billing period shall be held and added to the next billing period with no
penalty.
(Ord. 28-89. Passed 2-27-89.)
913.05 CHARGES MADE A LIEN.
   Each charge or rental levied by or pursuant to this chapter is made a lien
upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the
sanitary sewerage system of the City; if the same is not paid within thirty
days after it shall be due and payable it shall be certified to the Auditor of
Ross County, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the county with
the interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes are

the provisions of this chapter during the period the contract is in force or
during the period of any extension or renewal thereof.
(Ord. 2005-50. Passed 9-25-50.)

follow the requirements for notification as specified in Section
 1117.07 below.
   In considering a proposed zoning amendment, the Planning Commission may seek

(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1117.06 CRITERIA.

Council, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors:
   (a)   Whether the proposed change is consistent with the established land
use pattern in the surrounding area.

and thereby adversely impact public facilities such as schools, utilities,
streets.
   (c)   Whether the existing district patterns are logically drawn in relation
to existing conditions on the property proposed for change.
   (d)   Whether changed or changing conditions make adoption of the proposed
amendment necessary.
   (e)   Whether the proposed change is out of scale with the needs of the
neighborhood or City and existing zoning patterns.
   (f)   Whether the proposed change would be likely to have an adverse effect
on the existing natural environment.

whether the proposed change will further the purposes and objectives of this
and other ordinances, codes and regulations of the City of Chillicothe.
      (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1117.07 ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Public Hearing.  Before the proposed zoning amendment may be passed,
the City Council shall hold a public hearing, and shall give at least thirty
(30) days notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. If the proposed Ordinance intends to rezone or
redistrict ten (10) or less parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate,
written notice of the hearing shall be made by the Clerk of Council, by first-
class mail, at least twenty (20) days before the date of the public hearing to
the owners of property within, contiguous to, and directly across the street or
alley from such parcel or parcels to be redistricted to the address, as
provided by the applicant. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate such proposed amendment.
   (b)   Display of Relevant Materials. During the thirty (30) days as set
forth in subsection (a) above, the text or copy of the text of the proposed
Ordinance, together with maps, plans, and reports as submitted to the Planning
Commission shall be on file, for public examination, in the office of the
Zoning Inspector.
   (c)   Action by City Council. No zoning amendment which is in accordance
with the recommendation submitted by the Planning Commission shall be deemed to
pass or take effect without the concurrence of at least a majority of the
membership of the City Council. No zoning amendment which violates, differs
from, or departs from the recommendation submitted by the Planning Commission
shall take effect unless passed or approved by not less than three-fourths (3/
4) of the membership of the City Council. Failure of City Council to take final
action on the proposed amendment within sixty (60) days after the public
hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall be deemed a rejection
of the amendment.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1117.08  ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS.
   If the amendment as passed by City Council pertains to a change in the

conditions and character of the surrounding area.

1119.07    Supplementary conditions and safeguards.
1119.01 APPEALS.
   (a)   Taking of Appeals. Pursuant to Chapter 713 of the Ohio Revised Code,
appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of this Ordinance by the Zoning Inspector may be taken by any
person aggrieved, including a tenant, or by a governmental officer, department,
or board. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty (20) days after the date of
the decision, by filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board of Zoning
Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the decision of the Zoning Inspector
which the appeal is being taken.
   (b)   Imminent Peril. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector certifies to the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by
reason of facts stated in the application a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order which may, on due cause shown, be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals after notice to the Zoning Inspector, or
by judicial proceedings.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.02 POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, as hereinafter provided, such variances from the provisions
or requirements of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
requirements would result in practical difficulty and/or unnecessary hardship
that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and buildings
involved. No variance from strict application of any provision of this
Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that the applicant has
shown that the following facts and conditions exist:
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public health, safety and/or
welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   (f)   That the variance involves no violation of existing laws of the City
or the State of Ohio.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a variance
that would allow a use not permissible under this Ordinance in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this Ordinance in said district. No variance shall be authorized unless the
Board specifically finds that the conditions of the specific property for which
the variance is sought is not so typical or recurrent a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
condition.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.03  APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE AND APPEALS.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning certificate, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from
the decision of the Zoning Inspector, with the Board of Zoning Appeals, on a
form as specified for that purpose.
   The application for a variance or an appeal shall contain the following
information:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of the applicant.
   (b)   Legal description of property as recorded in Ross County Recorder's
office.
   (c)   A map or drawing to approximate scale, showing the dimensions of the
lot and any existing or proposed building.
   (d)   In cases of variance, if a specific property is involved, the names
and addresses of all property owners contiguous to, and directly across the
street or alley from the property, as appearing on the Ross County Auditor's
current tax list.
   (e)   In cases of appeal, the application shall include a copy of the
decision from which the appeal is sought.
   (f)   Each application for a variance or appeal shall refer to the specific
provisions of this Ordinance which apply.
   (g)   A narrative statement explaining the following:
      (1)   The use for which variance or appeal is sought.
      (2)   Details of the variance or appeal that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the variance or appeal should be granted,
as the case may be.
      (3)   The specific reasons why the variance or appeal is justified,
according to Section
1119.02(a) - (e).
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.04  PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.

(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.05 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Before holding any public hearing for a variance or appeal, notice of such
hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in
the City at least ten (10) days before the date of said hearing. The notice
shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing, and the nature of the
proposed appeal or variance. In addition, written notice of such hearing shall
be mailed by the Board, by first-class mail, at least ten (10) days before the

same information as required of notice published in newspapers as specified
above. Parties of interest shall include at a minimum, owners and occupants of
property contiguous to, and directly across the street or alley from the

invalidate the actions of the Board of Zoning Appeals. In cases of appeal,
adjacent and contiguous property owners and occupants need not be notified.
   In addition, at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the
applicant for a variance shall cause to be placed on the property in a
conspicuous place in the front yard, or if there is no front yard, on the front

(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.06 ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.

pursuant to Section
1119.04, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1119.07, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall transmit a written copy of its decision and findings to the
applicant. If the application is approved, or approved with supplementary
conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that will
make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   If the request for appeal or variance is denied, any party or entity may
seek relief pursuant to procedures as cited in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1119.07  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate and reasonable conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this Ordinance. No person shall violate any condition or safeguard when

or variance is granted. Any violation of this chapter shall be punishable
pursuant to Section
 1123.02.

conditional uses within the description of the respective zoning districts. The
Planning Commission may allow such a use to be established as a conditional use
where these unusual circumstances exist and where the proposed use will be
consistent with the general purpose and intent of this Planning and Zoning
Code.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)

variance shall cause to be placed on the property in a conspicuous place in the
front yard, or if there is no front yard, on the front of the building in a

Building." (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1121.04 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Commission shall not approve a conditional use unless it shall, in each
specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based on the particular
evidence presented to it, that support conclusions that such use at the
proposed location shall meet all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the general character of
such area.
   (b)   Seeks to maintain, and will not be hazardous to, the health, safety
and welfare of the existing neighboring, and the community.
   (c)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services

1113.06, within one (1) year after date of approval; however, the Planning
Commission may grant an extension of a zoning certificate for a conditional use
for an additional period of six (6) months. The Planning Commission may revoke
the zoning certificate if it finds, based upon written evidence by any citizen
or official of the City, of violation of this Ordinance and/or written terms

(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1123.02 VIOLATION.
   (a)   Violation and Remedies. If any building is or is proposed to be
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, changed, demolished,
maintained or used, or any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of
this Planning and Zoning Ordinance or any amendment or supplement thereto, City
Council, the Zoning Inspector or any aggrieved person who would be specifically
damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies provided by law,
institute appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful location,
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, demolition, conversion,
maintenance or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent
the occupancy of such building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal
act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.
   (b)   Failure to Obtain a Required Certificate or Approval. Failure to
obtain a zoning certificate, Certificate of Zoning Compliance, or other
approval as required by specific sections of this Ordinance shall be a
violation of this Ordinance and punishable under subsection (e) hereof.
   (c)   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Applications, Plans,
Permits, and Certificates. Zoning certificates or other approvals issued on the
basis of plans, plats and/or applications authorize only the use and
arrangement set forth in such approved plans and applications or amendments
thereto. Any use, arrangement, or construction not in conformance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance, and punishable as
provided in subsection (e) hereof.
   (d)   Complaints Regarding Violations. Whenever a violation of this
Ordinance is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint.

necessary and provided for by this Ordinance.
   (e)   Penalties for Violation. Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance

or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and in addition shall pay
all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues,
after receipt of violation notice, shall be considered a separate offense
without separate notice of violation.
   The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof,
and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found
guilty of a separate offense and be subject to the penalties herein provided.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City, or any owner of contiguous or
neighboring property who would be especially damaged by such violation from
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy such violation,
including but not limited to initiating suit for immediate termination of such
violation through injunction or other means.
     Penalties as above shall apply unless penalties are defined for specific
sections of this Ordinance, in which case the penalties so defined in those
sections shall apply.

CHAPTER 1125
Nonconformities
1125.01    Intent.
1125.02    Nonconforming uses.
1125.03    Nonconforming structures.
1125.04    Nonconforming lots of record.
1125.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance, or amendments
hereinafter adopted, there may exist uses of land , structures and/or lots
which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would
be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or
future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit such
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not necessarily to
encourage their survival and expansion and extension except as provided herein.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1125.02  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Nonconforming uses may be continued, restored, reconstructed, substituted,
extended or enlarged only as authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with the following requirements. When granting nonconforming use
exceptions, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to
maintain the intent and spirit of the zoning district in which the
nonconforming use is located.
   (a)   Continuation. Any use of land existing on the effective date of this
Ordinance may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the
provisions herein, so long as such use was legally existing prior to the
establishment of this Ordinance. No nonconforming use shall be moved, extended,
enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as provided in this
Ordinance.
   (b)   Substitution. The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow the nonconforming
use of a building or structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a more restricted classification, provided no structural
alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made. However, in an
"R" District, no change in use shall be authorized by the Board of Zoning
Appeals unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:
      (1)   The existing and proposed nonconforming uses were lawful at the
time of enactment of this Ordinance, and
      (2)   Such substitution is generally compatible with adjacent land use
and zoning patterns.
   (c)   Expansion/Extension. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as follows:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a lawful nonconforming use
to be expanded within an existing structure manifestly arranged or developed
for such use, provided the applicant clearly demonstrates that such expansion
is necessary and incidental to the continuance of such lawful nonconforming
use.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the expansion or extension
of a nonconforming use of land, not involving the physical expansion of a
building or structure, to an area consisting of one-hundred-twenty-five percent
(125%) of the area enclosing the nonconforming use at the time of enactment of
this Ordinance, provided such expansion occurs on the same lot as existing on
the effective date of this Ordinance. In such cases, the applicant shall
clearly demonstrate that the conditions in this Section have been met, that
such expansion is necessary and incidental to the continuance of such lawful
nonconforming use and that such expansion does not encroach on any yard or
setback required for the district in which the nonconforming use is located.
   (d)   Discontinuance. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued or
abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned whenever either of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of six
(6) months.
      (2)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1125.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Pending Applications for Zoning Certificates. Nothing in this
Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any structure or part thereof, for which a building permit or
zoning certificate has been duly applied for before the effective date of this
Ordinance, provided the construction of such building or structure shall have
commenced within ninety (90) days from the effective date of this Ordinance.
   (b)   Construction Commenced. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
this Ordinance or amendment hereto and upon which actual building construction
has been diligently carried, provided such construction is completed within two
(2) years from the effective date of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Nonconforming Mobile Homes. A nonconforming mobile home, as defined in
Chapter
1105, located in any district, once removed shall not be relocated on such lot,
or replaced with another mobile home. No enlargement, extension or expansion of
a nonconforming mobile home, as defined in Chapter
1105, shall be permitted within the City of Chillicothe.
   (d)   Extension.
      (1)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or
in part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard
and other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of
the district in which such building or structure is to be located.
      (2)   Any structure which is nonconforming due to its location or
configuration on the lot, resulting in lot coverage or yards inconsistent with
the requirements of the zoning district where it is located, may be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered in a manner that decreases or maintains its
existing degree of nonconformity, but in no case shall such structure be
enlarged, extended or structurally altered in a manner that increases its
degree of nonconformity.
      (3)   Any residence which is nonconforming due to the fact of its
location in a non-residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered, provided it meets the requirements of
the most proximate R-District.
   (e)   Damage and/or Destruction of a Nonconforming Building or Use. When a
building or structure, the use or location of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the
public enemy, it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such nonconforming
use, provided that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The restoration or rebuilding is commenced within six (6) months of
the time of damage, and construction is completed within one (1) year, unless
an extension is requested from and granted by the Planning Commission, and
      (2)   The damaged or destroyed building or structure was not located in
such a manner so as to encroach or intrude on adjacent property, and
      (3)   Such restoration or rebuilding would not extend or expand the
existing use beyond the parameters established in subsection (d) hereof.
   If any part of the damaged or destroyed building or structure encroaches or
intrudes on adjacent property, the location of the restored or rebuilt building
or structure is subject to approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals. If the
restoration or rebuilding of the building or structure involves extension or
expansion of the use, then the provisions of subsection (d) hereof shall apply.
   (f)   Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
prevent normal maintenance and repair of a building or structure containing a
nonconforming use. Structural alterations may be made to a building or
structure containing a nonconforming use when at least one of the following
conditions exist:
      (1)   When required by law.
      (2)   To convert to a conforming use.
      (3)   A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses
may be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height requirements or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1125.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has a minimum lot area of 3,000 square feet and at least thirty (30) feet
frontage on a public right-of-way; and further provided the following
conditions are met:
   (a)   If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property and did not
own such property at the time this Ordinance became effective, two (2) inches
may be deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four (4)
inches from the required sum of minimum widths of both side yards for each foot
that the lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than three (3) feet.
   (b)   If the owner of such lot owns two (2) or more adjacent lots, or other
adjacent property, such owner shall redivide the property in such a manner that
they conform to the minimum width of such lots in the most proximate single-
family district. However, if such redivision would result in lots that exceed
width requirement of lots in the most proximate district, such redivision shall
provide for one (1) more building lot than would otherwise be allowed.

CHAPTER 1131
Standard Zoning District Regulations
1131.01    Regulation of the use and development of land or structures.
1131.02    Rules of application.
1131.01 REGULATION OF THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures, and the
physical development thereof within each of the zoning districts as established
in Chapter
1133, are hereby established and adopted. (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1131.02 RULES OF APPLICATION.
   (a)   Identification of Uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this Ordinance.
   
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as a matter of
right in any zoning district, and any use not so designated shall be prohibited
unless:
         A.   A permitted use may be added to a zoning district by formal
amendment, in conformance with Chapter
1117.
         B.   An unlisted use may be determined by the Planning Commission to
be a similar use, in accordance with subsection (e) hereof.
      (2)   No more than one (1) permitted use shall exist on any one lot.
   (c)   Accessory Uses. Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in
accordance with the specific district regulations, and the requirements of
Chapter
1173.
   (d)   Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Planning Commission may in addition to the
development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with the specific
district regulations and requirements of Chapter
1121.
   (e)   Similar Uses.  
      (1)   Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses permitted by
right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of the district
and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use found similar
shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that district.
      (2)   Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in
the permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this Section,
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission on forms as may be prescribed by
the City for such purpose.
      (3)   Within thirty (30) days after such submittal, the Planning
Commission shall determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses
permitted in the specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the
Planning Commission shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
         A.   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in
another zoning district.
         B.   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the classification
to which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other
classification.
         C.   Such use creates no increased danger to health and safety,
creates no increased level of noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare,
or other objectionable influences, and does not create traffic congestion to an
extent greater than normally resulting from uses listed in the classification
to which it is to be added.
   (f)   Development Standards. Development standards as set forth in the
district regulations shall be the minimum allowed for uses permitted in that
district. If development standards are in conflict with requirements of any
other lawfully adopted rule, regulation, ordinance or statute, the most
restrictive standard shall govern.
   (g)   Site Plan. For particular uses in specific districts and conditional
uses, a Site Plan will be cited as required. In such cases, the Site Plan shall
be submitted by the applicant at the time of the application for a zoning
certificate, or at such time when the property is rezoned into that district.
The Site Plan for the property shall be drawn to approximate scale, and shall
clearly show all property lines, existing buildings, access drives, parking
areas, existing vegetation and other notable physical features. The Site Plan
shall also show the location, outlines and size of all proposed structures, and
the design of all improvements, including drainage, private streets, water and
sanitary sewer lines, and the size, design, materials and location of all
signage proposed for the development. The Site Plan shall also contain a
narrative description of the proposed use, and an evaluation of how such use
may impact adjacent property and methods that will be employed to alleviate or
minimize any adverse impacts.
   The Site Plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Inspector and may be subject
to review by the Planning Commission. The Site Plan must be approved as a
condition for the issuance of a zoning certificate. In reviewing such Plan, the
Zoning Inspector and/or Planning Commission may seek the timely input from
specific consultants as procured by the City for that specific purpose. In such
cases, the costs of such consultant input may be assessed to the applicant. In
approving a Site Plan, the Zoning Inspector and/or Planning Commission shall
find that the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   The use(s) and structure(s), as proposed, can be adequately and
efficiently served by public streets and utilities.
      (2)   The proposed building or use shall have sufficient yard space to
provide for adequate parking and screening of adjacent residential areas as may
be required in this Ordinance.
      (3)   The location, design and operation of the proposed use shall not
impose undue adverse impacts on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and/or
the Site Plan for the proposed facility has incorporated measures to lessen
and/or alleviate such adverse impacts and protect the character of such
adjacent residential areas.
      (4)   The use(s) and structure(s), as proposed, are generally consistent
with the purposes and intent of the zoning district and other provisions of
this Ordinance.
   (h)   Essential Services. Essential Services, as defined and specified in
Chapter
1105, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts within the
Municipality.

   The R-3 District is established to provide for the continuance of single-
family housing and reinvestment within the older portions of the City of
Chillicothe, and expansion of such uses at densities consistent with existing
development, thereby encouraging the revitalization of older neighborhoods and

development in these areas by meeting standards intended to promote the
neighborhood character of such new development.
   It is recognized that property in the R-3 District is located in the older
areas of the City, and that such areas are likely to be characterized by
patterns of mixed land use. Many of these mixed uses are the result of past
development practices and might not be allowed under the current provisions of
this Ordinance. It is the intent of this Ordinance, and this district in
particular, to protect and preserve the basic property rights of such existing
nonconforming properties. Specific provisions are made for the continuance,

CHAPTER 1159
(IR) Industrial Reuse District
1159.01    Findings of fact.
1159.02    Purpose.
1159.03    Permitted uses.
1159.04    Conditional uses.
1159.05    Development standards.
1159.06    Other requirements.
1159.01  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   Within the older neighborhoods of Chillicothe, there are numerous older
underutilized or vacant industrial structures that are located in close
proximity to existing residences and/or smaller commercial uses. Although the
reuse of these older structures is in the public interest, it is unlikely that
many contemporary industrial uses can be attracted to these locations.
Moreover, many traditional industrial uses may impose adverse impacts on nearby
residential areas. In addition, these sites may contain environmental
conditions that may limit future use potential.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1159.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Industrial Reuse (IR) District is to promote the
productive reuse of these older structures for an expanded range of industrial,
quasi-industrial and non-industrial facilities, while minimizing the impacts of
such uses on nearby residential areas.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1159.03 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   General office activities, consisting of facilities where activities
are conducted in an office setting and generally focus on business services.
   (b)   Personal services, consisting of firms providing personal services or
entertainment to the general public, including restaurants, banks and/or
savings and loans, credit unions, hotels or motels, medical and related
offices, and similar establishments.
   (c)   Manufacturing, compounding, processing, assembly and/or packaging of
products or materials, provided such operations are carried out totally within
the building.
   (d)   Warehousing and distribution, consisting of firms involved with the
storage and/or movement of goods.
   (e)   Industrial product sales or service, consisting of firms engaged in
the sale, rent or lease of products intended for industrial or commercial
users, or the repair and/or servicing of industrial or commercial machinery,
equipment or products.
   (f)   Retail sales and service, consisting of firms involved with the sale,
lease or rent of products or goods to the general public and/or providing on-
site product repair or services for such goods.
   (g)   Vehicle sales and/or service, consisting of firms servicing
automobiles, trucks and other commercial and/or consumer vehicles, including
motorcycles, boats and/or recreational vehicles.
   (h)   Single buildings containing not more than three (3) separate permitted
uses.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1159.04 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional uses may be appropriate within the IR District, but require more
detailed evaluation with respect to location, design, size, method and hours of
operation, intensity of use, traffic generation and potential impact on
surrounding uses. It is the responsibility of the Planning Commission to
perform this evaluation, based on analysis of the required Site Plan and to
attach such necessary and appropriate conditions and/or safeguards. Conditional
uses within the IR District shall consist of the following:
   (a)   Two or more family residences, provided the development standards of
the RM District are met.
   (b)   Contractor equipment and storage yards, provided adequate fencing and
screening devices are installed.
      (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1159.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Site Plan Required.  A Site Plan, pursuant to the requirements of
Section
1131.02(g), shall be required for all permitted and conditional uses in the IR
District. The Site Plan shall generally identify any environmental hazards on
the site and propose a strategy for addressing them. In addition, the Site Plan
shall clearly show methods that will be employed to address any potential
adverse impacts the operation of the proposed use may impose on adjacent and
proximate existing residential areas.
   (b)   Lot Area. No minimum lot area is required.
   (c)   Lot Width. No minimum lot width is required.
   (d)   Setbacks. The distance between any building or structure and the
right-of-way line of any public street shall be not greater than that of the
most proximate building on the same side of the street. No minimum side yard
setback shall be required, unless the building or structure is located adjacent
to an R District, in which case the setback shall be fifteen (15) feet.
   (e)   Property Maintenance. No owner of a property or structure in the IR
District shall fail to provide sufficient and reasonable care, maintenance and
upkeep to such property or structure. For the purposes of this Section,
maintenance and upkeep shall include keeping exterior surfaces free from
debris, garbage, noxious weeds, or free from hazardous objects or conditions
such as holes, broken concrete, broken glass, and dead or dying trees or
vegetation.
   (f)   Parking and Loading. Parking and loading spaces shall be provided as
required in Chapter
1177. All parking areas shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface
water which might accumulate within or upon such area, and shall be designed to
prevent the excessive drainage of surface water onto adjacent properties or
public roadways. The developer of the project shall demonstrate that adequate
provisions have been made to direct storm water runoff to a suitable and
adequate storm water drainage system as approved by the City Engineer, pursuant
to the Storm Water Management and Sediment Control Regulations, as cited in
Chapter
916 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (g)   Open Storage of Material and Equipment. The open storage and display
of material and equipment incidental to permitted uses shall be permitted on
portions of the property that are concealed from view of adjacent residences.
Any open storage area on other portions of the property shall be subject to
approval by the Planning Commission and screened from all adjoining properties
by means of walls, fences or plantings. Walls or fences shall be a minimum of
six (6) feet in height without advertising thereon. In lieu of such wall or
fence, a strip of land not less than ten (10) feet in width, planted and
maintained with an evergreen hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs not
less than four (4) feet in height at the time of planting may be substituted.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1159.06  OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the above requirements, any use or structure in the
Industrial Reuse District shall meet all applicable requirements of Chapters
1171 through
1181 of this Zoning Code.

1163.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to provide for planned unit development
(PUD) within the City of Chillicothe, in order to achieve:
   (a)   A greater choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and densities within a single development.
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more efficiency in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services.
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
   (d)   A more efficient use of land resulting in substantial savings through
shorter utilities and streets.
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use, density,
transportation, and community facilities objectives of the City.
   The Planned Unit Development process shall be treated as a zoning amendment.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.02 DEFINITION.
   "Planned Unit Development", or "PUD", shall mean an area of land in which a
variety of housing types and/or subordinate commercial facilities are
accommodated in a planned environment under more flexible standards, such as
lot sizes and setbacks, than those restrictions that would normally apply under
these regulations. The approval of such development contains requirements in
addition to those of the standard zoning districts, such as building design
principles, and landscaping plans.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.03 PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   Permitted uses within the R, LC and IP Districts may be combined in the PUD
District, provided that the proposed locations of non-residential uses are
specified in the preliminary and final development plans, are compatible with
the design of the overall tract and will not adversely impact adjacent
property.
   The amount of land devoted to non-residential uses in a planned unit
development combining residential and non-residential components shall require
approval by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.04 PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land proposed to be developed in a single PUD
District shall be a minimum of ten (10) acres. This requirement may be waived
by the Planning Commission if all property abutting the subject tract is
platted and/or developed.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.05 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area developed in any
planned unit development project shall be reserved for common open space and/or
recreational facilities. Such common open space shall be:
   (a)   Dedicated to a homeowner's association who shall have title to the
land which shall be retained as common open space. The legal articles relating
to the organization of the homeowner's association shall be subject to review
and approval by the Planning Commission and shall provide adequate provisions
for the perpetual care and maintenance of all such common areas; or,
   (b)   Dedicated to the City for parks, open space, or the site of schools or
other related public facilities. All land so dedicated to the City shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission and acceptance by
City Council; or,
   (c)   Some combination of subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way for watercourses or
other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication
unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a bikeway, trail or similar
facility and has been approved by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 27-11. Passed
3-14-11.)
1163.06 UTILITIES.
   All electrical, telephone, cable television, and similar utility
transmission and distribution lines shall be located underground.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.07 ARRANGEMENT OF NON-RESIDENTIAL USES AND PARKING.
   Parking areas within the PUD shall be in general compliance with the
requirements of Chapter
1177, as determined by the Planning Commission. When development in the PUD
District includes non-residential uses, buildings shall be located so as to
have common parking areas and common ingress and egress points, in order to
reduce traffic congestion and mitigate potential conflict points. Planting
screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of such areas where they
are adjacent to properties zoned for single family residential use. Parking
areas shall be designed so as to discourage single, large, unbroken paved lots,
and shall encourage smaller defined parking areas within the total parking
system. Such defined parking areas should be delineated and accented by
landscaped areas. Service, delivery, and loading areas shall be, to the maximum
possible extent, located to the rear of structures, and screened from view by
landscaping.
   The plan of projects developed in the PUD District shall provide for the
integrated and harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly
arranged facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such
other features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project
attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding
areas.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.08 RESIDENTIAL DENSITY.
   The City of Chillicothe is prepared to accept a higher density in particular
undeveloped areas than that reflected by current zoning, provided the developer
can utilize planned unit development techniques to demonstrate that any
increment of public cost clearly attributable to increased densities will be
compensated for by the private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by
the plan of development.
   The overall maximum density of the residential portions of the entire
planned unit development shall be consistent with the most previous zoning
classification in which the tract was located. The calculation of such density
shall be based on the number of proposed dwelling units divided by the area of
the site designated for residential use, excluding streets, rights-of-way and
parking areas.
   Notwithstanding the above, individual portions of the planned unit
development may be developed at a higher residential density, provided the
overall density meets the requirements above. In such cases, the resulting
undeveloped land may be utilized as common open space.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.09 PRIVATE ROADS.
   Private roads or streets as a common easement may be used in the PUD
District to provide internal circulation to clustered lots and/or individual
residential structures in residential planned unit developments in accordance
with the following requirements:
   (a)   The easement shall not be counted as required open space.
   (b)   The road or street is approved as part of the subdivision plat as the
most appropriate form of access to lots and/or structures.
   (c)   Private roads shall not be used to provide access to non-residential
areas or as through streets.
      (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)

(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.11 PRE-APPLICATION.
   The developer is encouraged to meet with the Zoning Inspector, City Engineer
and Planning Commission prior to the submission of the preliminary development
plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early and informally the
purposes of this section and the criteria and standards contained herein, and

1163.13 REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   Ten (10) copies of the completed application and Preliminary Development
Plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector at least sixteen (16) business
days prior to the Planning Commission's next scheduled meeting. Failure to
submit a complete application shall result in a refusal of acceptance. The
Zoning Inspector shall transmit the complete application package to the
Planning Commission and other parties as deemed appropriate for review and
comment.
   A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission not more than
sixty (60) days from the date of acceptance of the application package. The
notification requirements for such hearing shall be as set forth in Section
1117.07.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.14 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Within thirty-five (35) days after the public hearing held by the Planning
Commission, the Commission shall make a recommendation to City Council.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.15 CRITERIA FOR RECOMMENDATIONS BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Before making its recommendation as required in Section
 1163.14, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the facts submitted
with the application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
   (a)   Each individual part of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, and the uses proposed will
not impose undue adverse impacts on adjacent uses, but will have a beneficial
effect which could not be achieved under standard district regulations.
   (b)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate volumes of
traffic which would overload the street network outside the development.
   (c)   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the proposed
locations.
   (d)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by the
design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan.
   (e)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
   (f)   The existing and proposed public services are adequate for the
population densities and uses proposed, and in conformance with any capital
improvements programmed for the area.
   In making its recommendation, the Planning Commission may seek the
assistance and input of outside consultants and/or experts procured for that
purpose. All costs associated with such input shall be paid by the applicant
for the PUD zoning.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.16  ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL.
   Upon receipt of the recommendation by the Commission, City Council shall
review and take action on the application, following the procedures specified
in Section
1117.07 of this Ordinance. Following approval by City Council, the subject
property shall be considered as zoned PUD . The approval of that zoning shall
be conditioned on development of the tract being in conformance with the Final
Development Plan.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.17 FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Not later than twelve (12) months from the approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan, the developer shall submit ten (10) copies of the Final
Development Plan to the Zoning Inspector. The Final Development Plan shall be
in general conformance with the Preliminary Development Plan. Failure to submit
a Final Development Plan within the specified time period shall render the
approved Preliminary Development Plan and the rezoning of the property null and
void and the land shall revert to the zoning district in which it was located
prior to the amendment.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.18 CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   An application for approval of the Final Development Plan shall be filed

progression and a description of the design principles for buildings and
streetscapes; tabulation of the number of acres on the proposed project for
various uses, the number of housing units proposed by type; estimated
residential population by type of housing; estimated nonresidential population,
anticipated timing for each unit; and population density and public
improvements proposed for each unit of the development whenever the applicant
proposes an exception from standard zoning districts or other resolution
governing development.
   (d)   Engineering feasibility studies and plans showing, as necessary,
water, sewer, drainage, electricity, telephone, and natural gas installations;
waste disposal facilities; street improvements, and, nature and extent of earth
work required for traffic circulation and street improvements, and nature and

1163.19 ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Within sixty (60) days from submittal of the items specified for approval of
the Final Development Plan, or such other time as has been agreed to by the
owner or developer, the Planning Commission shall approve, deny or approve with
conditions, the Final Development Plan. Approval shall mean that it finds that
said plan is in conformance with the approved Preliminary Development Plan, and
that no significant constraints exist to construction of the project as
proposed.
   The Commission may grant conditional approval to a Final Development Plan.
Such conditional approval requires the applicant to alter the Plan or any part
of it, within a specified period after the end of the thirty (30) calendar
days, as a condition for final approval. Once all conditions have been met
within the specified period, the Commission shall cause its final approval to
be endorsed on the Plan.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.20 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL PERIOD.
   The approval of the Final Development Plan shall be for a period of not to
exceed two (2) years. If no construction has begun within two (2) years after
approval is granted, the approved Development Plan shall be null and void, and
the land shall revert to the zoning district in which it was located prior to
the amendment. An extension of this time limit, for a specific period, may be
approved if the Planning Commission finds that such extension is necessitated
by conditions beyond the control of the applicant.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1163.21  PLATTING.
   The creation of new parcels under any planned unit development shall be
subject to the subdivision requirements of this Ordinance. To reduce the length
of the review and approval process, a preliminary subdivision plat can be
submitted simultaneously with the Development Plan for rezoning to the PUD
District. A final subdivision plat cannot be submitted for review until an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance has been approved by City Council and such
amendment has become effective.

   (a)   The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made on
such forms as prescribed by the Zoning Inspector, along with such plans,
drawings, specifications and other materials as may be needed by the Design
Review Board to make a determination. At a minimum, such information shall
include the following:
      (1)   A site plan showing building outlines, dimensions, and landscaping.
      (2)   A complete description of the proposed environmental change.
      (3)   A photo of the building front or elevation drawing of same.
   (b)   Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed with

Design Review Board.
(Ord. 23-12. Passed 3-26-12.)
1167.07 CRITERIA OF EVALUATION OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed environmental change,
including landscaping or exterior signage, the Design Review Board shall
consider the following:
   (a)   The visual and functional components of the building and its site
shall be generally compatible with the historic context of its surroundings.
Such components shall include, but not be limited to, building height, massing
and proportion, roof shape and slope, landscape design and plant materials,
lighting, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and signage.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall be preserved and the
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
environmental features should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired sigriificance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the applicant shall provide evidence that new material matches the
material being replaced in composition, design, texture, and other visual
qualities as closely as possible. Repair or replacement of architectural
features should be based on accurate duplication of the feature, and if
possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than
on conjectural designs or availability of different architectural elements from
other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Blast
cleaning with natural aggregate material and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials should be avoided.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (i)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired. Additions to the least significant and least visible of historic
properties should be given priority over other designs.
   (j)   Reconstruction or rehabilitation within the Historic Design Review
District shall, when possible, conform to the distinguishing, original exterior
qualities or character of the structure, its site, and its environment.
   (k)   The design of new structures and of additions to existing structures,
including new site improvements, shall take into account the architectural
style, general design, arrangement, texture, color and material of other
structures and premises within the individual precinct.
   (l)   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures within the Historic Design Review District shall, when possible,
utilize natural traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry
and/or wood. The use of contemporary materials, such as aluminum and other
similar metals, fiberglass and plastic for exterior surfaces on architecturally
significant structures shall not be approved unless the applicant provides
evidence that the use of such materials would be consistent with existing
traditional materials and the overall integrity and longevity of the structure.
   (m)   All signs within the Historic Design Review district shall conform to
the Design Review Board's design guidelines for signs and to the material
standards of this Section; be of such size, scale, style color and design that
reflect the era during which the structure was built, and shall conform to the
requirements of this chapter. Sign size and shape shall also correspond to the
existing proportions of period structures, and signs shall not be permitted to
cover, “blank-out" or close existing window and doorway openings or otherwise
hide important architectural features.
   (n)   The proposed action is consistent with design guidelines for the
Historic Design Review Board District, as may be subsequently prepared for and
adopted by the Design Review Board.
   (o)   Exceptions. Under exceptional circumstances as the Design Review Board
may determine, the Board may approve environmental changes that consist of
decorative lighting, signs or other changes that do not strictly conform to the
design guidelines if the environmental change does not interfere with the
historical character of the streetscape and/or is in the best interest of the
District and City of Chillicothe, as determined by the Design Review Board.
      (Ord. 23-12. Passed 3-26-12.)
1167.08 DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Whenever a structure within the Historic Design Review District is
proposed to be demolished, partially demolished, or removed, the application
for the Certificate of Appropriateness shall clearly set forth the intent to
demolish. Pursuant to Section
1167.06 (d), the Design Review Board shall schedule a public hearing on the
application to occur not more than thirty (30) days from the date the
application is filed. Public notice shall be served no later than twenty (20)
days in advance of the public hearing. The Design Review Board shall take
action within ninety (90) days from the date of the public hearing.
   The Design Review Board shall grant the demolition and issue a Certificate
of Appropriateness when the applicant submits suitable evidence that one (1) or
more of the following conditions exists:
      (1)   The structure contains no features of architectural and historic
significance contributing to the character of the Historic Design Review
district within which it is located.
      (2)   The reasonable economic use for the structure as it exists or as it
might be preserved is of such minimal level, and the reuse value of the
property without the structure is of such level that there exists no feasible
and prudent alternative to demolition.
      (3)   Deterioration has progressed to the point where it is not
economically feasible to preserve and reuse the structure consistent with the
standards of Section
1167.07 .
   (b)   Failure to Submit Plans.  The Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition as issued shall contain enforceable deadlines and design commitments
for the site. A Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition shall not be
issued unless the Design Review Board has been presented with suitable plans
for the replacement design for the site after demolition consistent with the
intent of the Historic Design Review District along with enforceable deadlines
for completion of work.
(Ord. 23-12. Passed 3-26-12.)
1167.09 MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance
or repair of any property within the Historic Design Review District, provided
such work involves no change in material, design, texture, or exterior
appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of
any building, structure, or feature which in the view of the Zoning Inspector

not including bracing, framing and structural supports of the sign, unless such
support members are made part of the message or face of the design.
   (b)   Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces of
the sign shall be included in determining the area of the sign, unless one of
the following exceptions apply:
      (1)   Two (2) display faces join back-to-back and parallel to each other
and not more than twelve inches (12") apart.
      (2)   The sign is marquee, canopy or awning sign subject to the

through the center of the sphere, and the surface area of the half sphere shall
be counted as the sign face. For multifaceted signs, the area of all display
faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign.
   (d)   The area of the letters, numbers or emblems mounted directly on a
building wall or wall extension shall be computed by enclosing the entire word
or words formed by such letters, numbers or emblems with the smallest single
continuous perimeter consisting of rectangular or series of rectangles, and
determining the area within such perimeter.
   (e)   The height of the sign shall be measured from the average (mean)

such forms as may be provided by the City, or
      (2)   A letter of credit or certified check made payable to the City,
equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated construction cost as
approved by the City Engineer for the public improvements.
   (g)   All permits and approvals shall be obtained and all fees and deposits
paid prior to beginning any construction of any improvements.
   (h)   During construction and prior to acceptance of any public improvement,
the Owner/Developer shall remove or cause to be removed such dirt and debris
and foreign matter from all public rights of way, improvements or easements as
existed prior to the time of construction or were deposited, left or resulted
from the construction of improvements of any nature within the development.
Such removal shall take place within twenty-four (24) hours after being
notified by the City that such work is required, and shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer.
   (i)   All public improvements shall be guaranteed by the Owner/Developer for
a period of one (1) year from the date the public improvement is accepted, in
writing, by City Council pursuant to Section
1115.16. Such guarantee shall consist of a maintenance bond, certified check or
other acceptable instrument, for ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the
improvements and shall include the following:
      (1)   Any and all defects and deficiencies in workmanship and materials.
      (2)   The cost of all labor, materials, equipment and other incidentals
required to maintain, repair and replace any or all of such improvements and to
maintain them in good and proper condition, excluding ordinary wear and tear,
but including filling trenches and restoring lawns, sidewalks, yards, streets,
sewers, pipe lines.
In the event the Owner/Developer fails to make such maintenance, repairs or
replacements within ninety (90) days after notice in writing by the City
Engineer, or in the event of an emergency which may endanger life or property,
the City may make or cause to be made, such repairs or replacements from the
above guarantee.
   (j)   The Owner/Developer shall execute a development agreement with the
City, specifying the terms and conditions required under this Section of this
Ordinance.
   (k)   The Owner/Developer shall furnish to the City final plats and as-built

issuing the letter of credit responsible for the completion of the public
improvement according to the approved construction drawings and the agreement.
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1191.03 COSTS TO BE SHARED BY THE CITY.
   In consideration for the agreement by the Owner/Developer of the land being
developed to install utilities and/or streets to sizes and configurations in
excess of the needs of the land being developed, the City shall share in the
cost of the excess size and configuration of the utilities and/or streets as
set forth in this Section.
   (a)   A utility or street shall be considered excessive to needs of the land
being developed when any of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The City specifically requires a greater width, size or
configuration of any nonadjacent street for the purpose of meeting the future
needs of the City as provided for a comprehensive or thoroughfare plan, or
similar study, as adopted by City Council;
      (2)   There is additional pavement width and depth and/or additional
length of storm sewers and other improvements required for all thoroughfares;
      (3)   The City requests that a water line be more than twelve inches
(12") in diameter, when such size is not required to meet the needs of the land
being developed;
      (4)   A sanitary sewer line is more than fifteen inches (15") in
diameter, unless this size is required for the land being developed by reason
of grade or trench loading requirements of the land being developed, or because
of anticipated sewerage flows from the land being developed;
      (5)   Other conditions warrant cost sharing and such conditions are
approved by City Council.
   (b)   The City shall share in the cost of improvements by:
      (1)   Paying for all the material costs only for the size difference of
the waterline, sanitary sewer pipe and the appurtenances thereto between what
is required for the land being developed and what is excessive to the needs of
the land being developed, or
      (2)   Paying for all materials F.O.B. the plant, factory, supply depot or
warehouse for such other improvements that are excessive to the land being
developed.
   (c)   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted, read or construed to
obligate the City for expenses incurred by the Owner/Developer, contractor,
subcontractor or other persons because of:
      (1)   Equipment or labor costs related to excessive excavation, due to
the over sizing and/or increased depth or width of waterlines, sewers or
roadways. For the purposes of this Ordinance, "excessive excavation" shall
include excavation in bedrock, wet or loose soils, or at a depth of greater
than fourteen (14) feet;
      (2)   Equipment, labor or material cost due to improperly or unacceptable
installed improvements including the removal and replacement thereof; or
      (3)   Any improvements installed prior to the approval of the cost
sharing by the City.
   (d)   Upon approval by Planning Commission of the preliminary plat for the
land being developed, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The City Engineer shall identify all improvements eligible for cost
sharing, and shall estimate the cost of the City's portion of such
improvements;
      (2)   If applicable, an ordinance shall be submitted to Council for
approval, appropriating funds to cover the City's portion;
      (3)   Upon completion and acceptance of the work and quantities thereof
by the City Engineer, the costs shall be certified to the chief fiscal officer
of the City.
   (e)   Failure of the Owner/Developer of the land to provide the City with
copies of billings, invoices, contracts, agreements or such other evidence of
construction costs as the City Engineer deems necessary within three (3) months
of completion and acceptance of the improvements by the City, shall constitute
just cause to declare the City's agreement to cost share as provided in this
Section null and void. In such cases, no reimbursement shall be made or monies
paid without negotiation of a new cost-sharing agreement and approval of such
agreement and appropriation of costs by City Council.

      (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.02 GENERAL SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   The design of the subdivision shall be based on an analysis of environmental
characteristics of the site. To the maximum extent possible, development shall
be located so as to preserve the natural features of the site, avoid areas of
environmental sensitivity, and minimize negative impacts on and alteration of
natural features. The following specific areas should be preserved as
undeveloped open space, to the extent consistent with reasonable utilization of
the land:
   (a)   Wetlands, as defined in Section 404, Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, subject to field verification by the U.S. Army Corps of

      (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.03 LAND NOT SUITED FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   General Provisions. If the Planning Commission, upon recommendation of
the City Engineer, finds that land proposed for subdivision development is
unsuitable due to flooding, poor drainage, topography, landslip potential,
inadequate public facilities, or other condition that may be detrimental to the
general health, safety or welfare of the public, and if it is determined that
the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning
Commission shall not approve such subdivision unless adequate methods are
proposed by the Owner/Developer for alleviating the problems that would be
created by development of the land, subject to the approval of the City
Engineer.
   (b)   Land Subject to Flooding. The subdivision of lands within areas
subject to flooding shall be subject to the standards and regulations of
Chapter
1329 of the Codified Ordinances, and shall, in addition, be subject to the
following requirements:
      (1)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if the proposed
subdivision development will, individually or collectively, significantly
increase flood flows, heights or damages.
      (2)   No subdivision, or part thereof, shall be approved which would
substantially affect the storage capacity of the flood plain.
      (3)   Buildings or structures shall not be permitted in floodway areas.
Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway if the sites or
structures are elevated to such height that the lowest floor of the structure
is least one (1) foot above the 100-year base flood elevation, as established
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and/or other authorized
agency, in a flood study or report approved by the City. Required fill areas
must extend a minimum of fifteen (15) feet beyond the limits of the structure
(s) or required improvement(s).
      (4)   When the Planning Commission determines that only part of a
proposed plat can be developed in compliance with these requirements, it shall
limit development to only that portion.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may attach other reasonable conditions as
is appropriate to the approval of plats within areas subject to flooding. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirement for the
construction of dikes, levees or other similar measures, or flood proofing of
structures, as recommended by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.04 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   The Owner/Developer shall use adequate measures to minimize erosion and its
impacts during subdivision construction activity. The City Engineer may require
the Owner/Developer to submit detailed erosion and sedimentation plans if the
City Engineer determines that the size and/or scale of the proposed subdivision
warrants such action. Generally, such a plan shall be required for, but not
limited to, major subdivisions where the total area of the subdivision is more
than one (1) acre in size, or if the subdivision is located where average slope
exceeds five percent (5%). In addition, the City Engineer may require the
Owner/ Developer to submit erosion and sedimentation plans for any established
lot where development is proposed to occur.
   Erosion and sedimentation plans for subdivisions shall be prepared by a
Professional Engineer, and indicate the techniques and location of devices to
be used to control erosion both during construction and permanently, and
include a schedule for installing those devices. Erosion control plans shall be
based on the control of erosion on-site, with the objective of eliminating or
minimizing erosion and sedimentation impacts off-site. Techniques, devices or
measures used shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
   All erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be in place at the start
of construction activity.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.05 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance with Storm Water Management Regulations.  In addition to
the requirements of this Section, all storm water management, erosion and
sediment control activities carried out pursuant to these regulations shall be
subject to and in compliance with the Storm Water Management and Erosion and
Sediment Control Regulations as cited in Chapter
916 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Construction Site Runoff Control. The Owner/Developer shall use
adequate measures to minimize erosion and other negative water quality impacts
as a result of construction and development activity. The Planning Commission
shall have the authority to require a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan in
those cases where the scope and scale of the development warrants, as
recommended by the City Engineer. The Plan shall be prepared by a Professional
Engineer or other certified professional and shall be developed utilizing
current industry standards and effective Best Management Practices (BMPs). As
part of the plan, the Owner/Developer shall install, inspect and keep records
of inspection, and maintain BMPs throughout the duration of the permit. The
City Engineer may inspect the construction site for compliance with the Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan and, if found lacking, may issue a permit
violation, stop work order, fine or other measure to ensure compliance.
   (c)   Post Construction Runoff Control.     Post construction storm water
runoff control shall be addressed in the design phase of proposed subdivisions.
Both structural and nonstructural post construction BMPs will be considered.
Use of riparian setbacks, green space preservation, porous pavements, water
quality swales and grass filter strips are a few methods to be considered.
Specific sites within the proposed subdivision may be inspected for compliance
and, if found lacking, the City Engineer may issue a permit violation, stop
work order, or fine to ensure compliance. Fines as defined by separate
ordinance may be levied by the City as soon as one (1) week after notification
of violation.
   (d)   Storm Water Drainage.
      (1)   General. No subdivision plan or plat shall be approved that does
not make adequate provision for storm water runoff and flood waters. The
Planning Commission shall have the authority to deny subdivision approval for
areas of extremely poor drainage, including subdivisions in areas dominated by
hydric soils. In any subdivision, the storm drainage system shall be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Preservation of Natural Drainage Courses. Generally, the natural
flow of all existing drainage courses, including underground drainage systems,
shall be accommodated. Such underground systems, including farm field tile
systems, shall be identified and mapped as part of the preliminary plan.
No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or
structures shall be located unless provision is made for the flow of storm
runoff and/or surface water. The City Engineer may require an easement to be
provided on both sides of the existing surface drainage course adequate for the
purpose of future widening, deepening, enclosing or otherwise improving said
drainage course. If such drainage course crosses private property, easements
must be obtained by the Owner/Developer for construction and future
maintenance. These easements must be shown on the Construction Plans, including
the volume and page number of the recorded easement.
      (3)   Outlets. No subdivision plan or plat shall be approved by the
Planning Commission unless an adequate outlet for storm water, as shown on the
plan or plat, is approved by the City Engineer. The Owner/Developer shall pay
all costs associated with an analysis performed and submitted by a Professional
Engineer demonstrating that an adequate outlet for storm water runoff exists.
Generally it will be necessary to pipe storm water to an adequate watercourse,
stream or existing storm system which has the capacity to accommodate the flow,
or to utilize acceptable on-site water retention methods adequate to minimize
excessive off-site storm water flows.
      (4)   Submittal Data. Culverts and other components of storm water
conveyance systems that cross streets or roadways shall be designed so as to
adequately address the ten (10) year storm under residential streets and the
fifty (50) year storm under collector and arterial streets. The City Engineer
may require the Owner/Developer to pay for an analysis of the existing storm
water system by a Professional Engineer to determine how best to connect the
proposed development to the existing system or any required improvements
downstream so as not to overload the system. The post development runoff rate
may not exceed the predevelopment runoff rate as determined by the 100 year
storm event.
   (e)   Culverts. All culverts utilized in subdivisions shall have the
appropriate headwalls and/or other structures and improvements to protect the
facility.
   (f)   Open Drainage Channels. The determination as to whether a specific
drainage course shall be enclosed shall be made by the City Engineer. In those
cases where an open channel is determined to be acceptable, the cross section
and profile of the open channel and its banks shall be approved by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.06 STREETS.
   (a)   General. All streets shall be designed with appropriate regard for
topography, streams, wooded areas, soils, geologic limitations and natural
features. Roadways shall further be designed to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems layouts while providing safe and convenient access to property.
   (b)   Classification, Street Widths and Street Grades. The arrangement and
classification of all streets in newly developed areas shall conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan. For streets not indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan, the
arrangement shall provide for appropriate extensions of existing streets. The
Planning Commission shall make the final determination as to the classification
of any new street, based on the potential development of the site, and its
potential traffic volume as expressed in ADT (Average Daily Traffic), the
character of the surrounding area, the Thoroughfare Plan and the recommendation
of the City Engineer. Rights-of-way, pavement widths and street grades shall be
as specified in Appendix A, which is hereby made a part of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Alignment.
      (1)   In order to provide for efficient and effective access by emergency
vehicles, the street pattern shall make provision for the continuance of
streets and for the connection to existing rights-of-way in adjacent areas.
      (2)   If a subdivision adjoins or contains an existing or proposed
arterial or major collector street, direct access points to such street shall
be minimized. The Planning Commission may require marginal access streets or
reverse frontage with a planting strip of a minimum width of twenty (20) feet
on the rear of those lots abutting the said arterial or collector street, and
no vehicular access across the strip.
      (3)   If a subdivision adjoins an existing or proposed arterial or major
collector street, the Planning Commission may require drainage improvements and
the construction of separate turn lanes and/or traffic signals on such streets
into the proposed subdivision.
      (4)   Local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by through
   traffic.
      (5)   Streets shall intersect one another at ninety (90) degrees, or as
near to ninety (90) degrees as possible, but in no case less than seventy-five
(75) degrees. The intersecting street must remain within these degree    
parameters for a distance of not less than one-hundred feet (100') from the
stop bar or right-of-way line.
      (6)   Street jogs shall be discouraged. In no case shall a street jog be
allowed on an arterial street. Where such jogs are unavoidable, in no case
shall the centerlines be offset by less than 150 feet.
      (7)   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 1,000 feet, measured
from the centerline of the intersecting street to the middle of the turn
around, unless specific approval for greater length is granted by the Planning
Commission, upon recommendation of the City Engineer.
      (8)   Half width streets shall be prohibited.
 
   (d)   Dedication. The necessary rights-of-way for widening or extension of
all thoroughfares, shall be dedicated to public use. When a subdivision fronts
on an existing City street, or County or township road, dedication shall be
made to the proper authority so as to meet the requirements of the table in
Appendix A.
   (e)   Blocks. Blocks shall not be less than 800 feet nor more than1,400 feet
and in length, except where topographic conditions specific to this individual
subdivision require a greater length.
   (f)   Private Streets. There shall be no private streets or roadways nor any
private easement used for purpose of providing access to any subdivision unless
constructed and maintained to the specifications and standards of the City.
   (g)   Alleys. Alleys may be approved in residential subdivisions, when
justified by subdivision street design, to provide vehicular access to garages
or parking areas. Alleys may be approved in commercial or industrial
subdivisions if no other provisions can be made for adequate service access.
The minimum width for rights-of-way of any alley shall be twenty (20) feet and
shall be dedicated to the public.
   (h)   Street Names.  The names of new streets shall not duplicate names of
existing dedicated streets except that new streets which are extensions of
existing streets shall bear the names of such existing streets.
   (i)   Curbs, Gutters and Sidewalks. Curbs and gutters shall be required in
all subdivisions within the City of Chillicothe. Sidewalks shall be required in
all subdivisions where the average lot width of all lots within the
subdivisions is less than eighty feet (80'). In no case shall a Certificate of
Zoning Compliance be granted for a building within a new subdivision where
sidewalks are required until such sidewalks are constructed on the lot(s) and
approved. Sidewalks shall comply with standards as provided by the City
Engineer.
   (j)   Driveways.
      (1)   All driveways shall have a maximum grade of ten percent (10 %)
except under the provisions of Chapter
1197.
      (2)   The edge of all driveways shall be at least three (3) feet from the
side lot line.
      (3)   No driveway shall be approved providing direct access from a single
or two family residential lot to a street designated as an arterial or major
collector street. (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.07 LOTS.
   (a)   All lots shall have the required frontage on an improved public street
or an approved private street. Access to garages or parking areas via an alley
may be permitted if the alley is constructed to standards as approved by the
City Engineer.
   (b)   Lots in subdivisions located within the City of Chillicothe shall meet
the dimension and area requirements of the zoning district in which such
subdivision is located. In addition, all lots shall also meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   All residential lots shall be approximately rectangular in shape,
and should not have a depth in excess of four (4) times their width, except
where extra depth is necessary due to topography or natural conditions, or to
meet other requirements of this Ordinance.
      (2)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided, except
where required to provide separation from arterial or major collector streets,
or to overcome specific conditions of topography or orientation. In such cases,
an easement shall be provided along the rear lot line across which there shall
be no vehicular access.
      (3)   Whenever possible, residential subdivisions shall be designed so
that corner lots have a larger area than interior lots in order to accommodate
the additional setback of the second street.
      (4)   Whenever possible, side lot lines should be at right angles or
radial to street lines.
      (5)   Lots shall not be created by dividing land at the terminus of stub
streets in adjacent subdivisions, such stub streets being intended to promote
continuity of street systems in adjoining subdivisions.
      (6)   Additional lot width or a buffer strip of not less than fifty (50)
feet may be required where a residential lot backs up to a railroad right-of-
way, high pressure gas and/or liquid petroleum transmission lines, overhead
high voltage electrical lines, an arterial street or roadway or an open
drainage channel.
      (7)   When necessary, easements shall be provided along side and rear lot
lines for local service utility lines. Easements shall be provided on both
sides of any open drainage course, for the purposes of widening, deepening or
general maintenance. Such easements shall comply with the requirements of
Section
1193.08.
In no case shall a fence, planting or any other obstruction, including
playground equipment or other accessory structures be constructed on this
easement. Notwithstanding the above, the removal of any existing obstruction
within such easement shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property
at the time such action is required.
         (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-14-11.)
1193.08 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Utility Easements. Easements shall be required for poles, wire, cable,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, gas lines or any other

layout of all utilities from all entities providing service to the area.
Generally, such easements shall be no less than ten feet (10') in width, or
twenty feet (20') if multiple underground and overhead utilities are present,
and shall be located along front, rear or side lot lines of each lot.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, easements of greater width may be required in
particular cases upon determination of the City Engineer.
   (b)   Watercourse Easements and Riparian Setbacks. When any stream,
watercourse or surface drainage course is located within a proposed
subdivision, the Owner/Developer shall provide an easement along each side of
such stream, or water course or surface drainage course for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating or other maintenance thereof. The width of such
easement shall be determined by the City Engineer, but shall be no less than
twenty (20) feet. Provisions shall be made by the Owner/Developer for perpetual
maintenance of all stream, watercourse, or storm drainage course easements and
shall be specified on the final plat of the subdivision. (Ord. 27-11. Passed 3-
14-11.)
1193.09  SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   Sanitary sewers shall be designed to maintain a minimum velocity of

may participate in costs for the size increase, in accordance with the
procedures of Chapter
1191.
   (e)   Minimum cover for water lines shall be forty-eight inches (48"). Water
mains shall be laid so that at least ten feet (10') of horizontal distance and
eighteen inches (18") vertical distance is maintained between the water main
and any sanitary or storm water sewer line. In cases where ten feet (10') of
horizontal distance cannot be maintained, such as a crossing, the vertical
distance shall be maintained and such sewer lines shall be constructed of water
line material.
   (f)   At crossings of water mains and sanitary sewer lines, one full length
of water pipe should be used in order that both joints will be as far away from
the sewer line as possible. All crossings shall be made at a 90 degree angle.

requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1329.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of City of Chillicothe, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows: (Ord.
63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Chillicothe has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Chillicothe as identified in Section
1329.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City
of Chillicothe.
(Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Ross County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas effective December 7th, 2023.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Chillicothe as required by Section
1329.26 (c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
      Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Administration Building located at 35
South Paint Street, Chillicothe, Ohio 45601.
      (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Chillicothe, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure

Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade
elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
Basement
Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all
sides.
Development
Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See “Lowest Floor.”
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   1.    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus [one
(1)] foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   3.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   4.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
City of Chillicothe’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the lowest floor” which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by City of Chillicothe and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
“start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM March 17th, 1984 and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code §111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any
court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-
propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,
or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone
and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but
not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the ‘before damaged’ condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   2.    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

1329.21 STATE AND FEDERAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Development that is funded, financed, undertaken, or preempted by
state agencies shall comply with minimum NFIP criteria.
   (b)   Before awarding funding or financing or granting a license, permit, or
other authorization for a development that is or is to be located within a 100-
year floodplain, a state agency shall require the applicant to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the agency that the development will comply with minimum
NFIP criteria and any applicable local floodplain management resolution or
ordinance as required by Ohio Revised Code Section 1521.13. This includes, but
is not limited to:
      (1)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured home
park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
subject to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative
Code Section 4781-12.
      (2)   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Section 4906 of the Ohio Revised Code.

      (1)   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the potential
effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that its planning
programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies
and requirements of EO 11988.
         (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.22 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that Chillicothe’s flood
maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1329.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1329.26(c).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1329.22(a), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1329.22(a)(1).
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of Chillicothe,
and may be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Chillicothe
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Chillicothe’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Chillicothe
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Chillicothe suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits
or the new area for which the City of Chillicothe has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority. (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.23 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1329.27, Appeals and Variances.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
      (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.24 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (a)   Zone A.
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO. 
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1329.26(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C, and X.
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which
are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are encouraged to
reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that the health,
safety, and property of their citizens are protected. (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-
13-23.)
1329.25 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
      Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures
to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1329.22(a);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Chillicothe and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1329.26(i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Chillicothe specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1329.22(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 63-23. Passed 11-13-23.)
1329.27 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Chillicothe’s Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Chillicothe’s Code Section 1111.03.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City
Administration Building located at 35 South Paint Street, Chillicothe, Ohio
45601.
   
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1329.27(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the
Chillicothe.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1329.27(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become

(Ord. 141-05. Passed 12-26-05.)
1501.081 SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (a)   Requirement. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new
and existing occupied multiple-family dwelling structure to install and
maintain in proper working order smoke detectors in each such dwelling unit as
hereinafter provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible
or invisible particles of combustion and providing a suitable audible alarm
thereof; further, they shall be installed by May 1, 1984, in the manner
hereinafter provided, unless any other provision of County, State or Federal
Law shall require installation before that date. Failure to install smoke
detectors as and where required by such date shall subject the property owner
to the penalties set forth in subsection (i) hereof.
   (b)   Location.
      (1)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the multiple-
family living unit in which the bedrooms or sleeping rooms are located. Where
bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other use areas
such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets, they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section.
      (2)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed at the head of
stairways leading to occupied floors containing sleeping rooms or areas in such
manner as to assure that rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the
detector and the detector intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the
sleeping area.
      (3)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed in all basements or
cellar areas.
      (4)   In all dwelling units sharing a common means of egress hallway, an
adequate number of smoke detectors shall be installed in such hallways.
   (c)   Alternative. As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, an
approved fire detection system may be installed. Each fire detection system
shall be individually approved and a permit issued therefore by the Fire Chief.
   (d)   Equipment. All devices, combinations of devices, and equipment
required herein are to be installed in conformance with the Building Code and
this section, and approved by the Fire Inspector and listed by the Fire
Department for the purpose for which they are intended; such list may be
subsequently amended as necessary. Such approval shall be permanent unless the
Fire Chief subsequently finds that the equipment is hazardous or unreliable, in
which case, the Fire Chief may suspend or revoke approval. The Fire Chief may
in any such case determine whether replacement of existing installation shall
be required.
   (e)   Installation. In new multiple-dwellings, smoke detectors shall be
wired directly (hard-wired) to the building is power supply. In existing
dwellings, it is preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the power
supply; however, such detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or
operated in a plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main power
supply.
   (f)   Permits and Fees. No smoke detector or alternative system shall be
directly connected (permanently wired) to the electrical system of the
structure unless an electrical permit shall have first been obtained from the
Building Department. The Chief Enforcement Official is hereby authorized to
adopt a fee schedule for the issuance of such permit which shall not exceed the
cost of administration of this section; further, the Chief Enforcement Official
is authorized to waive, partially or wholly, the fee requirement at his
discretion, or to issue multiple permits under the payment of a single fee,
unless otherwise provided by Council.
   (g)   Supplemental Standards. This section is intended to be used with and
supplemented by the applicable provisions of the 2002 Edition of the National
Fire Protection Association Standard 72 which are hereby incorporated herein;
however, if there shall be any conflict between this section and such
supplemental standards, this section and any rules and regulations adopted
pursuant thereto shall prevail.
   (h)   Enforcement. The Chief Enforcement Official shall have concurrent
jurisdiction with the Chief of Fire and Fire Inspectors to inspect the
installation of any smoke detectors required to be installed by this section
and violations found to exist shall subject the property owners to the
penalties set forth in subsection (i) hereof.
   (i)   Inspections; Notifications. If any authorized representative inspector
of the City upon inspection, shall determine that any provision of this section
has been violated, he shall issue a written notice of such fact to the owner or
person in charge of such property, which notice shall inform the owner or
person in charge of such property, that the owner of the property has thirty
days after the date of the notice, to conform to the provisions of this section
or be subject to the penalties and remedies provided in such section. No owner
or person in charge of property or premises subject to the provision of this
section, shall refuse to allow inspection of such property or premises by duly
authorized inspection representatives of the City at all reasonable times, and
after notice as herein provided.
(Ord. 141-05. Passed 12-26-05.)
1501.09 DISCLOSURE OF TRUE FIRE SAFETY INSPECTOR STATUS.

hold himself out to be such, unless prior to commencing any inspection
function, he discloses the purpose for which he is making such inspection and
the fact that he is not employed by any state or local fire service or agency,
and that he is not acting in an official capacity for any governmental
subdivision or agency.
(Ord. 141-05. Passed 12-26-05.)
1501.10 FIRE EQUIPMENT SALE OR USE; CERTIFICATION OF INSTALLERS.

fire fighting equipment that does not meet the minimum standards established by
the Ohio Fire Marshal in the Ohio Fire Code.
   (b)   Except for public and private mobile fire trucks, no person shall
service, test, repair or install for profit any fire protection or fire
fighting equipment without a certificate issued by the Ohio Fire Marshal.
   (c)   Records of all tests, inspections, and maintenance required by the
Ohio Fire Code (OFC), or other OFC recognized standards shall be maintained on
site for a minimum of three (3) years and shall be submitted to the Chillicothe
Fire Department by the company performing such tests, inspections or
maintenance in the manner prescribed by the Fire Chief.

1501.12 CONFLICT.
   In all cases of conflict between the Ohio Fire Code and any Municipal
ordinance or technical code adopted thereby, the more restrictive provision
shall govern.
