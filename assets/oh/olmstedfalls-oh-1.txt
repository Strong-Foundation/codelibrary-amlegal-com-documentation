and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections by Justinian Publishing Company
are hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Olmsted
Falls, Ohio, save and except for any parts, titles, chapters, sections or
portions of same manifestly erroneous, the result of typographical error, or
other manifest error clearly and unequivocally contrary to the intent of

or regulation from which the same was extracted shall be consulted to determine

except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect any right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to effective date of such enactment, and any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability shall continue as
though no change in the legislative provisions had taken place. Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in the violation of such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
(1)    A grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

residents of the City of Olmsted Falls, in that it accomplishes needed
revisions in the governing ordinances and provides for more efficient
administration. It shall therefore take effect immediately upon passage by the

PUBLISHER'S NOTE
   The City of Olmsted Falls consists of the former Villages of West View and
Olmsted Falls. These Villages were merged, consolidated and combined
("annexed," in the language of the statute) by action of their voters under
authority of Ohio R.C. 709.22 et seq. The effective date of the consolidation
was January 1, 1971.
   The Report of the Annexation Commission to the Councils of the Village of
West View, Ohio, and the Village of Olmsted Falls, Ohio, provided (Section 25)
that the ordinances of the Village of West View were to become the effective
ordinances of the consolidated community and that the ordinances of the Village
of Olmsted Falls were to be effective only to the extent that their subject
matter was not covered by West View ordinances. These Codified Ordinances were
codified and edited accordingly. The complete Report is set forth below.
REPORT OF THE ANNEXATION COMMISSION
TO THE COUNCILS OF
THE VILLAGE OF WEST VIEW, OHIO
AND
THE VILLAGE OF OLMSTED FALLS, OHIO
TO THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF WEST VIEW, OHIO
TO THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF OLMSTED FALLS, OHIO

Gentlemen:
The Councils of the Village of West View and Olmsted Falls have appointed the
undersigned to act on behalf of both communities to study and formulate terms
and conditions under which both entities should be merged, consolidated or
combined into one community. It is understood that this legal action was
initiated by the majority of registered voters of the Village of Olmsted Falls
to be annexed to the Village of West View according to the prescribed
procedures set forth in the State of Ohio Revised Code, Sections Nos. 709.24
and 709.26.
It is further understood that the term "annexation" is the only legal term used
in the above State of Ohio Revised Code covering the merging of these two
communities. This Commission prefers to use the term "consolidation",
considering it more appropriate “in spirit”, and thus uses this term throughout
the following unanimously agreed upon conditions of "consolidation'':
   1.    The question of the consolidation of the Village of Olmsted Falls and
West View shall be submitted to the electors of both communities on May 5,
1970, for such electors’ approval or disapproval, based upon the conditions and
terms contained within this contract. In the event that the proposed
consolidation shall receive the approval of the electors, simple majority, in
both communities, proceeding as outlined in Sections 709.32, 709.33, and 709.34
shall commence. In the event that the proposed consolidation shall be defeated
by the electors, then the consolidation as proposed herein shall not take
effect.
   2.    The issue of the consolidation of the Village of West View and the
Village of Olmsted Falls shall be voted upon by registered voters of both
villages at their designated election polls. An election ballot will include
the following:
"Shall the Village of Olmsted Falls be annexed to the Village of West View?
YES ________ NO________ "
   3.    From and after midnight December 31, 1970, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this contract, the combined territories of Olmsted Falls and West
View shall be governed as one with an administration, consisting of a Mayor,
Clerk, and Treasurer, elected in the general election of November, 1970. For
the purpose of nominating and electing said new administration, any person who
has been a qualified elector in either of the two villages for three years or
more may be nominated for Mayor, Clerk, or Treasurer, by petition of any
twenty-five qualified electors, who shall be designated as his sponsors. The
terms of the new Mayor, Clerk, and Treasurer shall be for four years according
to the provisions of Chapter 733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   4.    Three councilmen from the Village of West View have submitted signed
resignations to a trustee, which shall become effective at such time as the
consolidation becomes legally effective. (See Appendix A for the form of
resignation. ) The vacancies thus created shall be filled at the first council
meeting in January of 1971, according to the procedure set forth in Ohio
Revised Code 731.43. Prior to December 22, 1970, the Council of the Village of
Olmsted Falls shall designate three of its members, or two of its members and
the Mayor of Olmsted Falls, to be the three new councilmen of the consolidated
community, by secret ballot conducted by the Clerk of the Village of Olmsted
Falls in which each member of council shall vote for not more than three
individuals. The three receiving the greatest number of votes must be appointed
to the council vacancies which will occur in West View, should annexation
become effective.
   In the event that the Council of the Village of Olmsted Falls fails to
follow the above procedure by the prescribed time, then the three members of
this Consolidation Commission representing Olmsted Falls shall make the
selection by simple majority vote on each of the three positions.
   At such time as the selection of councilmen to fill the proposed vacancies
is made, the names of the resigning West View councilmen shall be announced and
these resignations and the names of the men who will fill the vacancies shall
be a matter of public record.
   Within seven days after the vacancies created by the resignation of the
three councilmen from the Village of West View have been filled pursuant to
Ohio Revised Code 731.43, the legislative authority of the newly consolidated
community shall meet for the purpose of determining which two councilmen shall
serve the remaining one-year terms, and which four councilmen shall serve the
remaining three-year terms. Said determination shall be resolved by lot by the
newly elected mayor in the presence of all the members of council. The mayor
shall prepare six slips of white paper measuring approximately two inches
square, of which four slips shall each be marked with the numeral 3, two slips
each marked with the numeral 1. The marked slips shall then be placed by the
mayor in a container of his choosing and drawn by each councilman in
alphabetical order. The number drawn by each councilman shall constitute the
number of years of his or her term.
   5.    The name of the consolidated community shall be "Olmsted Falls". For
purposes of clarity, the term "West View", whenever used in this contract,
refers to the presently existing Village, and when used in speaking of matters
following the effective date of consolidation, the consolidated community. The
term "Olmsted Falls", as used in this contract, refers only to the presently
existing Village of Olmsted Falls.
   6.    The inhabitants and residents of the Village of West View and the
Village of Olmsted Falls, after consolidation, shall operate and have equal
rights and privileges as specified by the constitution and laws of the State of
Ohio.
   7.    The consolidation shall not affect any rights or liabilities existing
at the time of consolidation, either in favor of or against either municipality
except such as are effected by the terms and conditions of consolidation.
Pending suits and suits founded upon such rights and privileges may be
commenced and prosecuted to final judgment or decision as though consolidation
had not taken place.
   8.    Special Assessment Bonds for streets, sewers or other improvements in
either the Village of West View or the Village of Olmsted Falls, payable as
assessments so made and authorized, shall remain obligations against the
properties assessed until paid.
   9.    The property on the tax duplicate of the Village of West View shall
become subject to the payment of the pre-existing general obligation bonded
indebtedness of the Village of Olmsted Falls, and likewise, the property on the
tax duplicate of the Village of Olmsted Falls shall become subject to the
payment of the pre-existing general obligation bonded indebtedness of the
Village of West View.
   10.    The Village of Olmsted Falls has been ordered by the State of Ohio to
build a new sanitary sewer system. It is estimated that the cost of this system
will be approximately $2.7 million, of which obligations totaling approximately
$90,000 have already been met for plant design, assessment, and right-of-way
estimates, and financial counsel. No contracts have been let for actual
construction. Should the consolidation be approved, the sewer system would
become the responsibility of all residents of the consolidated community,
except those excluded by law. Since all residents would benefit, if
consolidation is approved officials of the community shall petition the Ohio
Water Pollution Control Board for an extension of the construction starting
date so that the plans can be expanded to meet the needs of the entire area. It
is recommended that present water lines be extended to areas of the community
not presently served by such lines.
   11.    All contractual obligations, including but not limited to rubbish
pick-up and insurance, of both Olmsted Falls and West View Villages shall
remain in effect until time of expiration or until renegotiated by the
government of the consolidated community.
   12.    All books, documents and records belonging to the Village of West
View and to the Village of Olmsted Falls shall become the property of the
consolidated community.
   13.    All monies, bank accounts, funds, accounts, and taxes receivable,
accounts payable, bonds, notes, and trust funds of the Village of West View and
the Village of Olmsted Falls shall be consolidated into common accounts of
assets and liabilities, and all obligations incurred or payable by said
Villages shall be assumed and payable by the consolidated community. If
approved by the electors as provided by law and as provided herein, the
certification of these terms and conditions of consolidation shall thereupon
operate as an assignment of and transfer of all the assets and liabilities,
both real estate and personal property of said Villages, to the consolidated
community.
   14.    All areas affected by the consolidation shall be continued in their
existing zoning classifications until amended by the government of the
consolidated community.
   15.    Liquor laws now in effect in existing areas will be continued for
said areas within the consolidated community.
   16.    The use of municipally-owned or leased buildings and properties will
be determined by the government of the consolidated community.
   17.    Consolidation as provided for in this contract is made for municipal
purposes only. Therefore, school districts and postal zones shall not be
affected.
   18.    The yearly salaries of the newly-elected officials shall be as
follows:
      Mayor    -    $ 2,400
      Councilman    -   $ 360
      Treasurer    -    $ 600
      Clerk       -    $ 3,000
   19.    All contracts and agreements entered into by the Village of West View
and by the Village of Olmsted Falls for the hiring of various village
employees, including but not limited to the police, law director, engineer and
building inspector, shall be subject to termination upon consolidation and if
terminated, shall be considered null and void.
   20.    It is not the intent of this contract to detail specific positions
for permanent employees. However, if the consolidation is adopted, all full-
time employees will be assured of employment as determined by government of the
consolidated community. A Civil Service Examination or its equivalent shall be
a dominant factor in determining officers of the safety departments.
   21.    The Commission recognizes the urgent need for a full-time fire
department and therefore strongly recommends that such a fire department be
established at the earliest possible time after consolidation.
   22.    Both villages need and use part-time employees. It is assumed that
all part-time employees will continue to serve as determined by the normal
procedure of favorable vote by the government of the consolidated community.
   23.    The appointed position of Law Director, Engineer and Building
Inspector will be determined by the normal procedure of favorable vote by the
government of the consolidated community.
   24.    The following committees or commissions shall be appointed:
      Planning Commission
      Board of Building Standards
      Zoning Board of Appeals
      Citizens Advisory Committee
   Their members shall be appointed by the government of the consolidated
community.
   25.    The ordinances of the Village of West View shall become the effective
ordinances of the consolidated community. The ordinances of the Village of
Olmsted Falls that are not covered by West View ordinances shall be in effect
for the consolidated community until review and codification of ordinances for
the consolidated community is consummated. This review and codification shall
be initiated immediately.
   26.   Each section of this contract is separate and independent from the
other sections and if any section fails for reasons of illegality or
unconstitutionality, or because it exceeds the powers of this Commission, all
other sections shall remain in full force and effect.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, We, a majority of the commissioners duly appointed to
study and formulate the terms and conditions under which the Village of Olmsted
Falls, Ohio, should be annexed to the Village of West View, Ohio, have hereunto
subscribed our names on this 12th day of January , 19 70 .

APPENDIX A
Council of the Village of West View

West View, Ohio 44138
Gentlemen:
In order to facilitate the amalgamation of the communities, I am hereby
resigning from the Village Council of the Village of West View in the event
that the annexation of the Village of Olmsted Falls becomes effective. I
request that this notice of resignation be retained by a trustee and that it be
kept in confidence until such time as the Village of Olmsted Falls agrees to
make public its choice of three councilmen to fill the vacancies to be created
on the West View Council. I wish it to be understood that this resignation
shall be null and void if, for any reason, the pending annexation fails.
Sincerely,
                              
Councilman

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

OF THE
CITY OF OLMSTED FALLS
PREAMBLE
Guided by principles of reason, justice, and humanity and in order that we may
exercise our duties as citizens to the fullest extent and secure for ourselves
all benefits and responsibilities of self-government available to us under the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, we, the people of the Municipality
of Olmsted Falls in the County of Cuyahoga and State of Ohio, do hereby adopt
this Charter for the government of our Municipality.
ARTICLE I
NAME AND BOUNDARIES
SECTION 1.01. NAME AND BOUNDARIES.
   The Municipality, now known as Olmsted Falls in the County of Cuyahoga,

privileges and powers pertaining thereto. The provisions of this Charter shall
apply whether this Municipality is a Village, City, or another type of
municipal corporation under the laws of the State of Ohio.
   The boundaries that now exist shall remain the same, with, however, the
Municipality having the power and authority to change the boundaries and annex
contiguous territory in the manner authorized by the general laws of the State
of Ohio; except that neither the Municipality nor any portion thereof shall be
annexed to any other municipality without the consent of Council by at least a
two-thirds (2/3) affirmative vote of the members elected thereto and an
affirmative vote by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the electors voting on such
question at a general election held and conducted in the manner provided by
law.
   Territory added to the Municipality shall immediately become subject to the
provisions of this Charter.

   The Municipal Government provided by this Charter shall be known as the
"Mayor- Council Form of Government."
ARTICLE III
MUNICIPAL POWERS
SECTION 3.01. POWERS.
   The Municipality of Olmsted Falls shall have all the powers, general or
special, governmental or proprietary, expressed or implied, which may now or
hereafter lawfully be possessed or exercised by this Municipality under the
Constitution or general laws of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the
manner prescribed by this Charter or, if no manner is specified herein, then in
the manner prescribed by an authorized action of Council. Should neither the
Charter nor Council prescribe a manner of exercise, the manner provided now or
hereafter by the laws of Ohio shall govern. Enumeration of or reference to
particular powers by this Charter shall not be construed to be exclusive.
SECTION 3.02. INTERPRETATION.
   The powers of the Municipality under this Charter shall be interpreted
liberally in favor of the Municipality, and the specific mention of particular
powers in the Charter shall not be interpreted as limiting in any way the
general power stated in this article.
SECTION 3.03. INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS.
   The Municipality of Olmsted Falls may exercise any of its powers or perform
any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or
in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one or more states or civil
divisions or agencies thereof, or the United States or any agency thereof, in
any manner not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio
and the Constitution and laws of the United States.

in the Mayor, directors of departments, and other administrative officers
provided for in this Charter or by ordinance.

be elected for a term of four (4) years, with the term of office commencing on
the first (1st) day of January, 2002, and thereafter.
(Amended 11-7-00)
SECTION 4.03. APPOINTING POWER.
   It shall be the duty of the Mayor to appoint the directors of all
departments and to make all other appointments provided for by law or ordinance
unless otherwise provided herein. Proposed appointment and subsequent removal
of directors of departments established by Charter in Section
9.01 and members of boards or commissions established by Charter shall be
presented in writing to the Clerk of Council, who shall place them on the
agenda of the next Council meeting for Council's consideration.
   Council shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of a proposed
appointment or removal from the Mayor, either confirm or reject such
appointment or removal. Confirmation requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the members elected to Council. If Council does not either confirm
or reject such appointment or removal within the time specified, the
appointment or removal shall take effect as if the same had been confirmed by
Council. Any rejection of a proposed appointment or removal shall be by a two-
thirds (2/3) vote of all members elected to Council and the reason or reasons
shall be entered in the journal and submitted in writing to the Mayor prior to
the next regular Council meeting.
   Council shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving a second proposed
appointment from the Mayor, either confirm or reject such second appointment.
Confirmation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the members elected
to Council. If Council does not either confirm or reject such second
appointment within the time specified, the appointment shall take effect as if
the appointment had been confirmed by Council.
   In the event that Council should reject both appointments, the power of the
Mayor to fill the vacancy shall terminate and Council shall make the
appointment by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members
elected thereto. The Mayor shall not have the power to veto this appointment.
   Unless otherwise limited by this Charter, the Mayor shall have the power, to
promote, demote, transfer, or remove any employee or official of the

(Amended 11-8-16.)
SECTION 4.04. GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES.
   It shall be the duty of the Mayor to act as chief conservator of the peace
within the Municipality; to supervise the administration of the affairs of the
Municipality; to see that all ordinances of the Municipality are enforced; to
recommend to Council for adoption such measures as he may deem necessary or
expedient; and to keep Council advised of the financial condition and the
future needs of the Municipality. He shall sign on behalf of the Municipality
all contracts, conveyances, evidences of indebtedness, and other instruments,
unless another official is specifically designated to do so by this Charter or
by ordinance. He shall exercise such other powers and perform such other duties
as are conferred or required by this Charter, by appropriate action of Council,
or by the general laws of Ohio.
(Amended 11-6-18)
SECTION 4.05. VETO POWER.
   Any ordinance or resolution passed by Council shall be signed by the
President of Council and presented to the Mayor by the Clerk of Council. If the

days after its passage or adoption by Council. If he does not approve it, he
shall veto it and return it to Council within ten (10) days by delivery to the
Clerk of Council, together with a written statement of his reason or reasons
for vetoing, which shall be entered in full in the journal of Council. The
Mayor may approve or veto the whole or any item of an ordinance appropriating
money, but otherwise his approval or veto shall be addressed to the entire
ordinance or resolution. If the Mayor does not, within the time specified, sign
or veto an ordinance or resolution after its passage, it shall take effect in
the same manner as if he had signed it. When the Mayor vetoes an ordinance or
resolution or item of it, as herein provided, Council may, but in no event
later than the next regular meeting occurring not less than fourteen (14) days
after notice of the veto is presented to the Clerk of Council, reconsider it
and adopt it by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members
elected to Council; in such event, it shall take effect as if it had on that
day received the signature of the Mayor. In all such cases, the votes shall be
taken by yeas and nays and entered by name in the journal.
SECTION 4.06. SUCCESSION TO THE OFFICE.
   In the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor as defined in Section
6.05 of this Charter, the President of Council shall become Mayor, to serve for

   (1)    The Mayor is temporarily absent from the Municipality for a period to
exceed forty-eight (48) consecutive hours and is not available for appearance
at the regular meeting place of Council within twenty-four (24) hours after a
legitimate and appropriate attempt to notify him of the necessity of his
presence has been made by the Clerk; or
   (2)    The Mayor is under such temporary disability as to render him unable
to perform the duties of his office; or
   (3)    Any real and imminent threat to the peace, health, or safety of the
Municipality or the persons therein arises and requires the immediate action of
the Mayor or a substitute therefore, and the Mayor is unable to be present to

requirement of notice; and may authorize the President of Council to act in his

of Council is temporary unable to serve as Acting Mayor, in which case the

shall remain posted until at least fifteen (15) days after its effective date.
   For purposes of this section an ordinance or resolution shall be deemed to
be formally introduced to Council at the time that said legislation is read for
the first time in a regular or special meeting of Council as provided for in
this Charter.
(Amended 11-6-84; 11-8-16.)
SECTION 5.07. EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Charter, any ordinance or
resolution shall become effective thirty (30) days after its approval by the
Mayor, or after the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the
Mayor, or after its passage by Council over the veto of the Mayor, as the case
may be. An ordinance or resolution may become effective after the aforesaid
thirty (30) days if a later date is specified in the text of the ordinance or
resolution. Ordinances for the payment of bills may become effective
immediately upon passage.
SECTION 5.08. EMERGENCY ORDINANCES OR RESOLUTIONS.
   To meet a situation affecting life, health, property, or the public peace,
Council may adopt an emergency ordinance or resolution. Such an emergency
measure shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances
and resolutions generally, except that it shall be read in full, unless two-
thirds (2/3) of the total number of Councilmen provided for by this Charter
dispense with the reading in full of such legislation in which case the
legislation shall be deemed to have been read in full if the title is fully
read, and shall be designated as an emergency measure and shall contain, after
the emergency clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists,
describing it in clear and specific terms, and indicating why emergency action
is necessary. An emergency measure shall become effective upon adoption or at
such later time as it may specify. It may be adopted, with or without
amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members elected to Council
shall be required for adoption.
   Emergency ordinances or resolutions may not:
   (1)   Adopt or amend a zoning regulation;
   (2)   Adopt or amend an administrative code;
   (3)   Establish, alter, or abolish any municipal department, office, or
agency;
   (4)   Levy taxes;
   (5)   Grant, renew, or extend a franchise;
   (6)   Regulate the rate charged for its services by a public utility;
   (7)   Convey or lease, or authorize the conveyance or lease of, any lands of
the Municipality;
   (8)   Adopt, with or without amendment, ordinances proposed under the
initiative power;
   (9)   Set the salaries paid to municipal officials or employees except where
an adjustment to the salary is necessary to keep it commensurate with the
experience of a newly hired, non-elected official or employee;
   (10)   Perform any other function prohibited by law from being authorized by
emergency ordinance or resolution.
   The validity of Council’s decision to declare an ordinance or resolution an
emergency shall be reviewable in a court of law at the volition of any resident
of the Municipality if such resident shall bring an action for declaratory
judgment on the legitimacy of the declaration of the ordinance or resolution as
an emergency within three (3) days of the final passage of the ordinance or
resolution. For purposes of determining the legitimacy of an emergency
declaration in the legislation of this City the reviewing court of law shall
take into consideration the Ohio Revised Code and the common law of the State
of Ohio which addresses itself to what is and what is not, a legitimate
emergency for municipal legislative purposes, and when such determination by
the legislative body of the City shall be overturned by a court of law. The
effect of the ordinance or resolution so challenged shall be suspended
immediately by the filing of such an action unless the rights of innocent third
parties would be prejudiced thereby. At the termination of the action so
brought, the ordinance or resolution shall take effect immediately if the
decision of the court is in favor of the Municipality. If the decision is not
in favor of the Municipality, the measure shall be repealed automatically as of
the date of entry of the judgment. If Council thereupon wishes to reintroduce a
measure on the same subject, that measure shall not be passed as an emergency
and shall be subject to referendum unless otherwise provided in this Charter.
(Amended 11-5-02.)

ARTICLE VII
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL
SECTION 7.01. POWER OF INITIATIVE.
   The electors of this Municipality shall have the power to propose any
ordinance or resolution to the Council and, if Council fails to adopt such
ordinance, to adopt or reject the same at the polls. This power shall be known
as the Initiative.
   An initiative ordinance or resolution shall be submitted to Council by a
petition signed by electors of the Municipality equal in number to at least ten
(10) percent of the total number of electors casting a Presidential vote in the
last Presidential election. When a petition is so submitted, the Clerk of
Council shall, within twenty (20) days, determine its sufficiency. The Clerk
shall retain possession of the petition until final determination of
sufficiency is made.
   If the Clerk finds the petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective and deliver a copy of his
certificate to the person who filed the petition with him. Such person shall
then be allowed fifteen (15) days from the delivery of such copy of certificate
in which to make the petition sufficient by means of a document correcting the
particulars certified defective (such document to be hereinafter known as an
"amended petition").
If an amended petition is filed, the Clerk shall within ten (10) days determine
its sufficiency. If the amended petition be found insufficient, it shall be
retained by the Clerk and declared null and void. If an amended petition is not
filed, the original petition shall be retained by the Clerk and declared null
and void. A final determination of insufficiency, even if sustained upon court
review, shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition.
   If the petition or amended petition be found sufficient, Council shall take
final action, whether enacting, amending, or rejecting the proposed ordinance
or resolution within forty (40) days after certification of sufficiency. If
Council fails to pass such proposed ordinance or resolution, or passes it in
some form different from that set forth in the petition therefor, the
petitioners, through a majority of the committee (as defined in Section
7.05 of this Charter) named on such petition, may at the next regular meeting
of Council request in writing that it be submitted to a vote of the electors.
Thereupon, Council shall within forty-eight (48) hours provide for the
submission of the petitioned ordinance or resolution to the electors at an
election occurring more than seventy-five (75) days after the request by the
committee for submission of the measure to the electors; but if such petition
is signed by electors equal in number to at least twenty (20) percent of the
total number of electors casting a Presidential vote in the last Presidential
election, the day of the election may be fixed therein, but in no case shall it
be held fewer than seventy-six (76) days after request by the committee.
   Any initiative ordinance passed by a vote of the electors shall not be
subject to repeal by Council within one (1) year of its passage, except that
such an ordinance may be repealed at any time by unanimous vote of all members
elected to Council.
(Amended 11-8-94)
SECTION 7.02. POWER OF REFERENDUM.
   There shall be two (2) methods whereby an ordinance which is subject to
referendum may be submitted to a vote of the electors of this Municipality.
   (a)   Referendum by Petition. Within thirty (30) days after final adoption
of any ordinance or resolution not excepted under Section
7.03 hereof, a petition signed by electors equal in number to at least ten (10)
percent of the total number of electors casting a Presidential vote in the last
Presidential election may be filed with the Clerk of Council, requesting that
Council either repeal the ordinance or resolution, or submit said ordinance or
resolution to a vote of the electors. When the petition has been filed, the
Clerk shall, within twenty (20) days, determine its sufficiency. The Clerk
shall retain possession of the petition until final determination of
sufficiency is made.
If the Clerk finds the petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective and deliver a copy of his
certificate to the person who filed the petition with him. Such person shall
then be allowed fifteen (15) days from the delivery of such copy of certificate
in which to make the petition sufficient by means of a document correcting the
particulars certified defective (such document to be hereinafter known as
“amended petition”).
If an amended petition is filed, the Clerk shall within ten (10) days determine
its sufficiency. If the amended petition be found insufficient, it shall be
retained by the Clerk and declared null and void. If an amended petition is not
filed, the original petition shall be retained by the Clerk and declared null
and void. A final determination of insufficiency, even if sustained upon court
review, shall not prejudice the filing of an initiative petition seeking to
repeal the ordinance or resolution in question.
If the petition or amended petition be found sufficient, Council shall within
forty (40) days reconsider the ordinance or resolution. If Council fails to
repeal the ordinance or resolution within the allotted time, Council shall
submit it to a vote of the electors at the next general election occurring more
than seventy-five (75) days after the certification of sufficiency of the
petition.
   (b)   Referendum by Vote of Council. Council may, by affirmative vote of at
least three-fourths (3/4) of its members, submit any proposed ordinance to a
vote of the electors. (Amended 11-8-94.)
SECTION 7.03. ORDINANCES NOT SUBJECT TO REFERENDUM.
   The following ordinances shall not be subject to referendum:
   (1)   Ordinances or resolutions making or transferring annual
appropriations, or amendments thereto;
   (2)   Ordinances or resolutions providing for the discharge of any
obligation legally due from the Municipality;
   (3)   Ordinances or resolutions submitting any measure to a vote of the
electors;
   (4)   Ordinances or resolutions not having the force or effect of law;
   (5)   Ordinances providing for public improvements petitioned for by the
owners of the majority of the frontage benefitted and to be paid for by
assessment of the owners of the property to be benefitted;
   (6)   Ordinances carrying a valid emergency clause as defined in Section
5.08 of this Charter.
SECTION 7.04. SUSPENSION OF EFFECT OF ORDINANCE REFERRED.
   When a referendum petition is filed with the Clerk of Council, the ordinance
sought to be reconsidered shall be suspended from taking effect. Such
suspension shall terminate when:
   (1)   There is a final determination of insufficiency of the petition; or
   (2)   Council repeals the ordinance; or
   (3)   The results of the voting on the referred ordinance have been
certified.
SECTION 7.05. PETITION PROCEDURE.
   Whoever seeks to propose an ordinance or resolution in this Municipality by
initiative petition shall, before circulating such petition, file with the
Clerk of Council a verified copy of such petition, which shall contain the full
text of the proposed ordinance or resolution. Whoever seeks reconsideration of
an ordinance or resolution by means of a referendum petition shall, before
circulating such petition, file with the Clerk of Council a verified copy of
such petition, which shall contain the full text of the ordinance or resolution
sought to be referred. The Clerk shall furnish a dated receipt to the person
filing such initiative or referendum petition.
   All petition papers circulated for the purpose of Initiative or Referendum
shall be uniform in size and style according to the laws of the State of Ohio.
The signature to an initiative or referendum petition need not all be appended
to one paper, but to each separate petition thereto shall be attached a
statement of the circulator thereof, as provided by general law. Each signatory
of any such petition paper shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and
shall indicate after his name his place of residence by street and number.
There shall appear on each petition the names and addresses of five (5)
electors, who, as a committee of petitioners, shall be regarded as responsible
for the circulation and filing of the petition. The five (5) members of such
committee of petitioners shall be signatories of the petition and shall have
the right and obligation to name another signatory to the committee in event of
a vacancy. All petition papers comprising an Initiative or Referendum shall be
assembled and filed with the Clerk as one instrument.
SECTION 7.06. SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS.
   Ordinances submitted to a vote of the electors in accordance with the
Initiative and Referendum provisions of this Charter shall be submitted by
title, which shall be prepared in all cases by the Law Director upon direction
of Council. The title shall be a clear, concise statement, descriptive of the
substance of such ordinance. Immediately below the title, the propositions “For
the Ordinance” and “Against the Ordinance” shall appear.
SECTION 7.07. RESULTS OF ELECTION.
   (a)   Initiative. If a majority of the electors voting on a proposed
initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adoption upon
certification of the election results and shall be treated in all respects in
the same manner as ordinances of the same kind adopted by Council. If
conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the one receiving the
greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such
conflict.
   (b)   Referendum. If a majority of the electors voting on a referred
ordinance vote against it, it shall be considered repealed upon certification
of the election results. If a majority of the electors voting on a referred
ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall take effect upon certification of the
election results and in no case shall its effect be retroactive.
SECTION 7.08. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by recall election
any elected officer of the Municipality. A petition demanding the recall and
removal from office of an elected officer may be filed with the Clerk of
Council. Such petition shall be signed by electors equal in number to at least
twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of electors casting a Presidential
vote in the last Presidential election. Such petition shall state the position
of the elected officer, his name, and the reasons for his proposed removal in a
statement not to exceed two hundred (200) words. In the case of a Ward
Councilman, such petition shall be signed by electors equal in number to at
least twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of electors casting a
Presidential vote in that Ward in the last Presidential election, and only
electors of said Ward shall be eligible to sign such petition and to vote in
said recall election.
   When a petition for recall of an officer elected at large or of a Ward
Councilman is so submitted, the Clerk of Council shall, within twenty (20) days
determine its sufficiency. The Clerk shall retain possession of the petition
until final determination of sufficiency is made.
   If the Clerk finds the petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective and deliver a copy of his
certificate to the person who filed the petition with him. Such person shall
then be allowed fifteen (15) days from the delivery of such copy of certificate
in which to make the petition sufficient by means of a document correcting the
particulars certified defective (such document to be hereinafter known as an
“amended petition”).
   If an amended petition is filed, the Clerk shall within ten (10) days
determine its sufficiency. If the amended petition be found insufficient, it
shall be retained by the Clerk and declared null and void. If an amended
petition is not filed, the original petition shall be retained by the Clerk and
declared null and void. A final determination of insufficiency, even if
sustained upon court review, shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition.
   If the Clerk finds the petition or amended petition sufficient, he shall
promptly so certify to Council and to the officer whose removal is sought, and
shall make a record of the delivery of such certification to such officer. If
the officer named does not resign within five (5) days thereafter, Council
shall thereupon fix a date for a recall election, such election to be held not
fewer than forty (40) days nor more than fifty-five (55) days from the date of
the certification of sufficiency of the petition.
   At such recall election, the following question shall be placed upon the
ballot: “Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the
office)?,” with provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively
on such question. If a majority of the votes cast at such recall election are
in the negative, such officer shall be considered removed, and his office shall
be declared vacant, such vacancy to be filled as provided in this Charter. The
officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment
to any vacancy directly or indirectly created thereby.

and Zoning Commission for report and recommendation.
   No action of Council shall be taken overruling the action of the Planning
and Zoning Commission except by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/
3) of the members of Council. Failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to
act within forty-five (45) days on any matter before it may, at the discretion
of Council, have the same effect as approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   Council, by ordinance, may ratify, reverse, or modify any decisions of the
Board. The applicant making the appeal or Council itself may request a public
hearing before Council prior to Council ruling on any decision of the Board. In
such case, Council shall provide the procedure for such hearing and ruling. The
decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall become effective thirty
(30) days after notification of the decision is mailed to the applicant and the
Clerk of Council unless Council takes action on the decision or the applicant
notifies the Clerk of Council in writing of his request for a Council ruling on
the decision.
   Failure of Council to act within thirty (30) days after such request or to
rule within fifteen (15) days after a public hearing shall constitute a
ratification of the decision of the Board. A Council ruling modifying or
reversing a decision of the Board shall require an affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the members elected to Council.
   Failure of the Board to make a decision within sixty (60) days after the
date of receipt of an application for a hearing shall constitute a denial of
the application and a ruling in favor of the ordinance or decision in question.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR’S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
and any future legislation.

208.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   (a)   Pursuant to City Charter Section
5.03(k), Council hereby adopts this Code of Ethics for all appointed and
elected officials, members of city boards and commissions, and employees of the

officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people; that government decisions of policy be made in proper channels of
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for
all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The
purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish ethical standards of conduct for
all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions which
are incompatible with the best interests of the City.

be in the best interests of the City. The obligations and prohibitions in this
Chapter shall supplement and be consistent with any and all Federal or State,
rules, regulations, procedures, ordinances, and codes governing ethics,
professional conduct, or conflicts of interest, and is not intended to replace,
override, or otherwise pre-empt any ethical requirement under general law.

214.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (a)   The City of Olmsted Falls is committed to maintaining a work
environment that is free of discrimination and harassment based on a person's
race, color, religion, sex, age, ancestry, disability, national origin, family
status, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression, consistent with
applicable laws. All employees should respect the rights, opinions, and beliefs
of others. Harassment of any person, whether directed at an employee, vendor,
customer or member of the public, is strictly prohibited. Employees should be
aware that discrimination and harassment in the workplace are violations of
Federal and State laws and can be addressed through the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   (b)   Employees are individually responsible for refraining from engaging in
harassing or offensive conduct and are encouraged to report harassing or
offensive incidents. Each supervisor has a responsibility to keep the workplace
free of any form of harassment. In particular, no supervisor or employee is to
threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's
refusal or willingness to submit to sexual advances will affect an employee's
terms or conditions of employment in any way.
(Ord. 06-2017. Passed 3-28-17.)
214.02 PURPOSE.
   It is the primary goal of this policy to provide the employees of the City
with an environment free of discrimination, including sexual harassment. The
intent of this policy is to state clearly the City's policy regarding
discrimination, with attention to gender discrimination and sexual harassment,
and to provide for disciplinary action in the event the policy is not followed.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.03 SCOPE.
   This policy covers all employees of the City of Olmsted Falls regardless of
their position. This policy also applies to other work-related settings, such
as business trips, seminars, conferences, and other business-related social
events.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.04 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Discrimination" is defined as conduct that is harassing, offensive,
or disruptive. Discrimination encompasses any form of harassment, to include
motivations such as: race, color, religion, sex, age, ancestry, disability,
national origin, family status, sexual orientation, or gender identity or
expression.
   (b)   "Sexual orientation" means a person's actual or perceived
homosexuality; bisexuality; or heterosexuality, by orientation or practice, by
and between consenting adults.
   (c)   "Gender identity or expression" means having or being perceived as
having gender-related identity, appearance, expression, or behavior, whether or
not that identity, appearance, expression, or behavior is different from that
traditionally associated with the person's assigned sex at birth.
      (Ord. 06-2017. Passed 3-28-17.)
   (d)   "Sexual harassment" is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, comments
or requests. Sexual harassment exists when employment decisions are based upon
sexual conduct or when the work place is so permeated with conduct of a sexual
nature that it alters the terms and conditions of employment and creates an
abusive and hostile working environment.
      (Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.05 PROHIBITED CONDUCT; SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (a)   Sexual harassment does not generally encompass conduct of a socially
acceptable nature. However, some conduct which is appropriate in a social
setting may be inappropriate in the work place. Sexual harassment occurs when
behavior of a sexual nature is directed toward an employee who finds that
behavior unwelcome and offensive. Sexual harassment also occurs when the
behavior fails to respect the rights of others, is demeaning or lowers morale.
The victim's acquiescence in the behavior will not negate the existence of
sexual harassment.
   Sexual harassment may also extend beyond the confines of this organization.
Conduct that occurs off duty and off premises against an employee of the City
may be subject to this policy.
   (b)   Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to, requests for
sexual favors, sexual comments, suggestions, jokes, leering, pats, squeezes or
other similar contact, and the posting of sexual pictures, cartoons, photos or
other graphics. Such conduct constitutes sexual harassment when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of employment.
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as a basis for employment decisions affecting that individual.
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
environment.
   Specifically, no supervisor or employee shall threaten or insinuate, either
explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual
advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation, wages,
advancement, assigned duties, shifts or any other condition of employment or
career development.
   Other sexually harassing conduct in the workplace, whether committed by
supervisors or nonsupervisory personnel having the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment, is also prohibited.
   (c)   Any conduct, as described above, whether by supervisors or
nonsupervisory personnel, may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including discharge.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.06 PROHIBITED CONDUCT; DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT.
   No person may harass another person because of that person's race, color,
age, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or gender
identity or expression. Examples of conduct prohibited by this policy include,
but are not limited to, using racial and ethnic slurs or offensive stereotypes
and making jokes about such characteristics.
(Ord. 06-2017. Passed 3-28-17.)
214.07 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   It is the City of Olmsted Falls' policy to investigate thoroughly and
remedy any known incidents of harassment. In order to accomplish this, however,
harassment must be brought to the-attention of management. Accordingly,
employees who feel aggrieved because of harassment have an obligation to
communicate their problem immediately. The following steps should be followed
by an employee who has a complaint of harassment:
      (1)   An employee who feels comfortable doing so should directly inform
the person engaging in the harassing conduct that such conduct is offensive and
must stop.
      (2)   An employee who believes he or she has been harassed shall report
the incident (in writing) either to his or her supervisor, the harasser's
supervisor, or the department head.
      (3)   An employee who feels he or she has been harassed by any person
with supervisory authority, or any employee who feels that his or her
complaints of harassment have not been remedied, shall contact the Mayor.
      (4)   If the complaint cannot be forwarded to any of the persons set
forth above, then it may be forwarded to the Director of Law or to the Council
President.
   (b)   Interviews and/or hearings into the alleged misconduct will be
conducted. A full report of findings will be given to the Mayor for final
determination. If the Mayor is accused of harassment, the report will be given
to the Law Director or the Council President. A thorough investigation can take
several weeks, in some cases. An employee may at any time ask the person to
whom he or she reported the incident to about the status of the investigation.
Regardless of the method selected for resolving the problems, the initiation of
a complaint of harassment will not cause any reflection on the complaining
employee, nor will it affect that employee's employment, evaluation, wages,
advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or any other condition of employment or
career development.
   (c)   If it is determined that harassment has occurred, appropriate
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, will be taken.
   To the extent possible, every reasonable attempt will be made to maintain
confidentiality during the course of an investigation into a charge of
harassment.
   If an employee has any questions about this policy he or she should contact
the Mayor for additional information. If the employee has other questions or
concerns about discrimination or harassment, the employee may contact the local
office of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
    Information obtained during the investigation will be kept as confidential
as practicable, although confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. If the
investigation reveals the complaint is valid, prompt attention and disciplinary
action designed to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence will be
taken.
   All employees are required to cooperate in any investigation of a harassment
complaint.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.08 FALSE COMPLAINTS.
   Although legitimate complaints made in good faith are strongly encouraged,
false complaints or complaints made in bad faith will not be tolerated. Failure
to prove discrimination or sexual harassment will not constitute a false
complaint without further evidence of bad faith. False complaints are
considered a violation of this policy and an employee who makes a false
complaint may be subject to disciplinary action.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.09 RETALIATION.
   The City, its supervisors and/or employees, shall not in any way retaliate
against an individual for filing a complaint, reporting discrimination or
harassment, or participating in an investigation. Retaliation is a serious
violation of this sexual harassment/discrimination policy. Any employee who
feels that he or she is subjected to retaliatory conduct as a result of actions
taken under this policy shall report such conduct to the appropriate individual
immediately. Any person found to have retaliated against an individual for
reporting discrimination or sexual harassment will be subject to the same
disciplinary action provided for offenders of this sexual harassment/
discrimination policy.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.10 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   Discrimination and sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Disciplinary
action will follow a violation and will be reflective of the seriousness of the
violation. If the investigation establishes that the accused employee engaged
in discrimination or sexual harassment, discipline, up to and including
removal, will be administered. Offenders will be disciplined without regard to
their position or job performance.
   All employees of the City have a responsibility to become familiar with this
policy, to assist in its enforcement and to abide by its terms. Any employee
who has knowledge of sexually harassing conduct, and who allows that conduct to
go unaddressed, may be subject to discipline.
(Ord. 109-98. Passed 1-26-99.)
214.11 POLICY AS CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT.
   All employees of the City will be expected to comply with this policy as a
condition of continued employment with the City.

220.01 MEETINGS.
   (a)   Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of Council shall be held at 7:00
p.m. at the City Hall designated by Council, on the second and fourth Tuesdays
of each month, except that Council may elect by motion to recess during the
entire months of July and August in any year. Should any regular meeting day be
a legal holiday, the regular meeting shall be postponed until the next day
which is not a legal holiday, at the same time and place. Meetings may be
adjourned to some other convenient place if the demand for space for the
audience present requires it. In such event, a notice of adjournment stating
the new location shall be conspicuously posted at the official location and the
meeting shall be delayed for an amount of time sufficient to allow interested
persons to travel from one location to the other.
   (b)   Adjourned Meetings. Should a quorum not be present at any regularly
scheduled meeting, the meeting shall be adjourned until the following day at
the same time and place. Council may also, by motion, elect to adjourn any
regular or special meeting from day to day. In any case where a meeting is
adjourned until a later time, any Councilman not in attendance at the
previously scheduled time shall be given at least twelve hours notice of the
time and place at which the continuation of the meeting will be held, orally or
in writing.
   (c)   Special Meetings. Special meetings may be called at any time by
written notice signed by the Mayor or by at least three members of Council, and
delivered personally or left at the residence of each Councilman who has not
signed the notice, at least twelve hours in advance of the time of the special
meeting. Written notice may be waived in writing by any Councilman who did not
receive such notice in the above manner.
   (d)   Compelling Attendance. After adjournment of any special meeting or
regularly scheduled meeting for one day for lack of a quorum, should a quorum
then fail to be in attendance, the Mayor or any three members of Council may
compel attendance by providing any Councilman with a notice in writing served
upon him personally that his presence at Council is required at a time not less
than forty-eight hours after receipt of the notice, which time shall be
definitely specified.

common with any other member of Council, call any member to order who violates
the rules and shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal by any two
members of Council. On such appeal, there shall be no debate but the members
making the appeal may briefly state their position and the Presiding Officer

of Council and to which any business of the City can be referred for informal
discussion in work session format, by the Presiding Officer, or by the
President of Council or by a majority of Council upon motion to refer a
particular matter to the Committee. The Committee shall be entitled to discuss
any matters of City business, in informal discussion, and such work session
meetings shall be chaired by the President of Council, who shall be responsible
for setting the agenda and establishing the meeting dates and times. The Mayor
may attend such meetings, but is not required to attend such meetings, unless
requested by a majority of the Committee. Department directors are not required
to attend such meetings unless requested by a majority of the Committee.
   The results of votes taken at any such Committee meeting are not final
decisions of Council, but have the status of recommendations which Council is
given the opportunity to consider further and which Council shall vote on
finally at a regular or special meeting of Council. All meetings of the
Committee shall be in accordance with the general laws of the State, including,
but not limited to, Ohio R.C. 121.22, as amended from time to time.

elected to Council may request. Such committees shall continue in existence for
the term specified in their appointment, or for the duration of the stated
purpose, if any, for which they were created. Council shall have at least one
representative on each such committee. Other committee members need not be
members of Council nor employees or officials of the Municipality.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
220.065 COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES.
   (a)   Accurate minutes shall be taken at each Council committee meeting by a
member of the committee designated to do so by the chairman, unless there is a
designated secretary who shall take the minutes. Such minutes shall be promptly
recorded and open to public inspection within a reasonable time after the
conclusion of the meeting at which they are approved, but in no event more than
ten working days thereafter.
   (b)   Council committee minutes shall include, but not be limited to, the
location, the date, the time of commencement, those present, topics discussed,
committee recommendations, if any, and the time of adjournment of that
particular meeting. Copies of any correspondence referred to in the minutes are
to be attached as a part of the Minutes of Record and presented to interested
parties upon request made to the Clerk of Council for the same. Minutes shall
only reflect the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions
held by the Council committee i.e. personnel matters, litigation, negotiations,
security and the like.
   (c)   Minutes of a particular meeting of a Council committee shall be
presented to that Council committee at its next scheduled meeting for approval.
(Ord. 30-90. Passed 2-13-90.)
220.07 LEGISLATIVE ACTION.
   (a)    Regular Introduction. Ordinances and resolutions may be introduced
only by the Mayor or any member of Council present at the meeting at which they
are introduced. No second is required.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
   (b)   Legislation Committee. The Legislation Committee may propose
legislation to be introduced in accordance with the Charter and may review
properly introduced ordinances and resolutions as it deems appropriate. The
Presiding Officer may refer any properly introduced resolution or ordinance to
the Committee for the purpose of comparing it with existing ordinances to
eliminate conflict or duplication, to correct errors in form and to number
various sections in accordance with these Codified Ordinances. The Committee
shall report its recommendations upon any such referral at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of Council. In addition, requests to the Committee for review
or initiation of legislation may be made by the Mayor, Council members or
Council committees. Requests for legislation by directors or chiefs should be
made through the proper Council committee. The committee reserves the right to
make recommendations on proposed legislation or properly introduced ordinances
and resolutions. All proposed legislation shall be reviewed as to form by the
Law Director.
(Ord. 64-82. Passed 9-13-82.)
   (c)   Other Committees. The Presiding Officer may, prior to final passage of
any ordinance or resolution properly introduced, in addition to and
simultaneously with or following the reference to the Legislation Committee, or
in lieu thereof, refer any ordinance or resolution to any standing committee
appropriate for the consideration of such measure, or to a special committee
appointed for such purpose. Such committee shall conduct such investigations,
hearings and debates as it deems proper and shall report its recommendations to
Council without unreasonable delay. A majority of the members of Council then
in office may at any time take the matter from the hands of the committee and
return the measure to the floor for consideration.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71. )
   (d)   Debate. No ordinance or resolution shall be open to debate unless it
is properly introduced. Even when properly introduced, no ordinance or
resolution shall be open to debate unless it is on its second reading or unless
passage may be accomplished without further reading by Council or report from
any committee to which it has been referred. This section notwithstanding,
amendments may be offered, debated and acted upon at any reading. Such rule may
be suspended by two-thirds of the members present. Except when such rule is
suspended, discussion, comments, questions and suggestions shall be referred to
the Legislation Committee outside the Council meeting. Debate shall be governed
by Robert's Rules of Order.
(Ord. 17-78. Passed 3-28-78.)
   (e)   Voting. After the requirements regarding reading have been
accomplished, and after any committee to which the measure is referred has
reported on it or has had the matter removed from its hands by Council, the
resolution or ordinance shall be voted upon without further delay, unless
tabled by a vote of two-thirds of the members of Council then in office. Voting
on a resolution or ordinance shall be by roll call by the Clerk of Council or
acting Clerk of Council, and each member shall cast his vote by "yes" or "no"
without further debate or discussion, unless such debate or discussion is in
the form of an explanation of the member's vote under point of personal
privilege sought and obtained from the Presiding Officer. The Clerk of Council
shall record each member's vote on the Journal of the proceedings. Members may
abstain from voting, in which case their vote shall be counted as being with
the vote of the majority of those who do vote.
   (f)   Posting and Codification. As soon as practicable after passage of an
ordinance or resolution, the Clerk of Council shall cause true and exact copies
of the measure to be posted as required by the City Charter. The Law Director
shall decide whether the measure shall be codified in accordance with the
requirements of the Codified Ordinances and shall, if proper to do so, cause
the ordinance or resolution to be numbered accordingly and shall submit such
numbered copy to the Clerk of Council for maintenance in accordance with
Section
202.07.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
220.08 MOTIONS,
   (a)   Any procedural or administrative matter may be presented for the
consideration of Council by oral motion, unless an ordinance or resolution is
required by law. Such motions, when seconded, shall be open for debate unless
otherwise specified, which debate shall be governed by Robert’s Rules of Order.
Vote on such motion shall be by voice vote, with passage requiring a majority
as determined by the Presiding Officer. Any member may call for a division of
the question, or the Presiding Officer may direct the same, and the division
shall be accomplished if the motion comprehends questions so distinct that, one
being taken away, the other could still stand. Any member may call for and
obtain a roll call vote on any motion, provided such is requested before
Council has moved on to other questions.
            
   (b)   When a question is on the floor, no motion shall be acceptable except:
      (1)   To adjourn;
      (2)   To suspend the rules;
      (3)   To withdraw a motion;
      (4)   To object to consideration;
      (5)   To lay on the table;

      (7)   To postpone to a certain day;
      (8)   To refer to committee; or
      (9)   To amend.
   (c)   The priority of motions shall be in the order arranged in subsection
(b) hereof. The motion to adjourn shall always be in order, unless voting has
commenced on the question on the floor. Motions to adjourn, to table and to
close debate shall be voted on without debate.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
220.09 ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS.
   Each member of Council shall be expected to attend meetings faithfully and
promptly and to stay until adjournment, unless excused by reason of having
given notice of the reason for the absence or leaving to the Presiding Officer.
Upon motion by any member of Council, the Presiding Officer shall be required
to state the excuse, and upon further motion Council may decide whether an
excuse is valid and shall be accepted.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
220.10 EXPENDITURES NOT PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED .
   Any expenditure not previously the subject of an appropriation ordinance
shall require an ordinance before it is authorized or made.
(Ord. 33-71. Passed 7-27-71.)
220.11 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   In all public hearings conducted by Council where the procedure is not
otherwise provided by law, procedure shall be as follows:
   (a)   The Council President shall preside over the meeting.
   (b)   The Chairman will recognize the party appealing to Council or
otherwise wishing to change the status quo, permitting him to make an
introductory statement; the Chair shall then recognize the opposing views,
including those of residents or members of any City board, commission,
department or office, permitting them to make a short introductory statement.
In all cases the Chair shall use its discretion concerning the number of
persons who may advocate a cause for any one side and the length of time they
may speak.
   (c)   Thereafter each side, in the order in which it was called upon to make
statements, may produce any evidence not deemed irrelevant or immaterial by
Council acting through the Chair. Once again the Chair shall have discretion to
limit the amount, quantity and quality of the evidence.
   (d)   After all of the evidence has been presented, Council may, through the
Chair, request the various positions to submit a short summary statement.
   (e)   Council shall make its decision by public vote or secret ballot as it
so chooses, after having considered the same either in public or in retirement,
with the majority of Council prevailing.

(Ord. 31-2008. Passed 6-10-08.)
234.13 POLICY GOVERNING THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ("RAINY DAY") FUND.
   (a)   Purpose: To protect the fiscal position of the City of Olmsted Falls
from the effects of economic uncertainty, fiscal emergency and budget
shortfalls, a formal policy on the City's General Fund reserve balance shall be
established. The policy shall set a targeted amount of liquid financial
reserves, or unrestricted fund balance, to assist with unanticipated
circumstances or events resulting in revenue shortfalls or increased, necessary
expenditures. Within the requirements and best practices set forth in the Ohio
Revised Code (ORC), the Auditor of State's Office (AOS) and Government Finance
Officers Association (GFOA), this policy shall serve to set the amount of
unrestricted funds to be held in reserve, the conditions under which those
funds can be allocated, guidelines for replenishment of those funds in the
event they are used for an allowable circumstance(s), and guidelines for
situations in which reserve funds exceed the threshold of this policy.
   (b)   Application: The General Fund consists of financial transactions
specific to the general operations of the City, including general operational
costs, capital funding, debt service payments, contractual relationships, and
departmental subsidies. This policy shall serve to establish a fund reserve for
the City's General Fund.
   (c)   Government Best Practices and Compliance:
      (1)   According to the GFOA, governments should maintain adequate levels
of fund balance to mitigate current and future risks (e.g., revenue shortfalls
and unanticipated expenditures) and to ensure stable tax rates. GFOA recommends
that governments establish a formal policy on the level of unrestricted fund
balance that should be maintained in the General Fund for Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and budgetary purposes. GFOA recommends, at a
minimum, that general-purpose governments, regardless of size, maintain
unrestricted budgetary fund balance in their General Fund of no less than two
months of regular General Fund operating revenues or regular General Fund
operating expenditures.
      (2)   In addition, R.C. § 5705.13, allows the establishment of a reserve
balance account in the General Fund to stabilize subdivision budgets against
cyclical changes in revenues and expenditures, also known as a budget
stabilization fund. The amount of money to be reserved in such a fund in any
fiscal year shall not exceed five percent of the revenue credited in the
preceding fiscal year to the fund in which the reserve is established. AOS
Bulletin 2011-004 also provides guidelines on budget stabilization funds.
Specifically, this bulletin states, in part, "In Ohio, a taxing authority of a
subdivision, by resolution or ordinance, may establish reserve balance accounts
to accumulate currently available resources to stabilize its budgets against
cyclical changes in revenues and expenditures under R.C. § 5705.13."
   (d)   General Fund Reserve Policy: The City of Olmsted will maintain a
reserve fund balance within the General Fund as a sound fiscal management
practice. Although the City will strive to maintain a General Fund reserve
balance within GFOA best practices, the following parameters shall set the
guidelines for establishing the General Fund reserve balance amount:
      (1)   Annual review and establishment of reserve: The amount kept in
reserve will be assessed each year as part of the budget process and monitored
with the Finance Committee. The General Fund reserve will be assessed against
this policy. The General Fund reserve will be presented to City Council as part
of the budget presentation. The amount will be based on the currently adopted
operational General Fund expenses for the fiscal year.
      (2)   Minimum balance: The City will keep a minimum fund balance within
the General Fund of sixteen percent of currently adopted operational General
Fund expenses for the fiscal year.
      (3)   Budget Stabilization Fund: The City may establish, through
legislation, a Budget Stabilization Fund, or "rainy day fund", in accordance
with R.C. § 5705.13. The fund will be part of the General Fund; therefore, the
balance maintained in this fund will be calculated into the minimum reserve
balance set forth in this policy. Funding of this reserve will be done in
accordance with the ORC and through Council legislation. Uses of this reserve
is detailed in division (f) of this section.
   (e)   Funding the Reserve:
      (1)   The General Fund reserve balance is calculated to be the
unrestricted General Fund balance at the end of each fiscal year. If a Budget
Stabilization Fund within the General Fund is established, the City may fund
this reserve in accordance with R.C. § 5705.13 (City Council approval and not
to exceed five percent of the preceding fiscal year's revenue). The Budget
Stabilization Fund, if established, will be included in the minimum calculation
of the General Fund reserve balance.
      (2)   The following shall dictate the methodologies used for addressing
shortfalls within the General Fund reserve balance:
         A.   If the reserve balance within the General Fund falls below the
minimum amount defined by division (d)(2) of this section, the City Manager and
Director of Finance shall provide a report and refunding plan and timeline to
the Finance Committee and City Council. Such plan must be authorized by a super
majority vote (5/7) of the body of City Council. Specifically, the report must:
            1.   Define the time-period and contingencies for which the
unrestricted fund balance dropped below the minimum fund balance;
            2.   Describe how the government's expenditure and/or revenue
levels will be adjusted to match any new economic realities contributing to the
use of fund balance as a financing bridge; and,
            3.   Describe the time-period over which the components of fund
balance will be replenished and the means by which they will be replenished.
   (f)   Use of Fund Reserve Balance: Use of the General Fund's unrestricted
reserve balance will be presented within City Council's appropriation measures.
City Council shall determine the amount of the preceding year's reserve that
will be spent, if necessary, when developing the annual budget.
      (1)   General Fund unrestricted reserve balance uses: Uses of the City's
General Fund reserve balance, include the following, in no particular order:
         A.   Transfer of funds to the Capital Improvement Fund.
         B.   Transfer of funds to the Economic Development Fund.
         C.   Retire, or pay down, existing debt.
         D.   One-time expenses deemed necessary for the continued development
of the City.
         E.   Funding projects or objectives highlighted by City Council.
         F.   Expenses related to unanticipated, extreme, or unforeseen
liabilities such as emergencies, natural disasters, and economic downturns.
         G.   Providing short-term capital financing in anticipation of future
revenues (i.e. receipt of debt-service revenues, reimbursable grants).
      (2)   Budget Stabilization Fund uses: If a Budget Stabilization Fund is
established, City Council must authorize a transfer out of the fund and the
transfer must be used for an authorized purpose. Transfers out of this fund may
be used on a restricted basis for the following purposes:
         A.   Operating budget shortfalls, which may include replenishing the
General Fund's unrestricted reserve balance to prevent a reduction in the level
of public services.
         B.   To fully or partially support a General Fund deficit.
         C.   Other expenses related to unanticipated, extreme, or unforeseen
liabilities such as emergencies, natural disasters, and economic downturns.
      (3)   Request for use of these funds that would result in taking the
reserve below the minimum balance established in division (d) of this section
must be authorized by City Council through a budget appropriation or amendment
by a super majority (5/7) vote of the body. Authorization of use of these funds
below the minimum balance must be accompanied by a refunding plan and timeline
which shall be reviewed and approved by both the Finance Committee and City
Council, as described in division (e) of this section.
   (g)   Policy Review: This policy is meant to provide a plan for the
establishment of such General Fund reserve funds and direction for the use of
those funds. To effectively manage the intent of the policy, an annual review
of the policy shall be undertaken.

244.19 CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES; EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE.
   The evaluation of the performance of an employee on the job for the purpose
of placing him or her in one of three classes shall occur in the following
manner:
   (a)   The Supervisor and each member of the Service Department within the
classified service of the City shall, jointly, in some reasonable and
democratic manner, design a system for evaluating the performance of employees,
other than the Supervisors, in the Streets Department and the Building
Department. Such system, and any of its amended versions, shall be approved by
the Civil Service Commission prior to its implementation. The system shall
award points to individual personal and professional attributes which together
constitute the criteria for determining each class in the respective
Departments, in a manner as objectively and as similar as possible to other
departments which may have such a system. Attributes may be weighted
differently; point totals corresponding to the ranges for first, second and
third classes may be suggested. A standard form shall be prescribed for
recording points awarded according to this system, which shall include places
for:
      (1)   The Supervisor to recommend at which class the employee being
evaluated should be placed;
      (2)   Such employee to sign his or her name, acknowledging his or her
examination of the completed form;
      (3)   Such employee to indicate his or her acceptance or protest of the
evaluation and recommendation; and
      (4)   The appropriate Department Director to indicate his or her approval
or rejection of the recommendation of the Supervisor.
   (b)   The Supervisor of each Department, once each year, shall award points,
as accurately and as fairly as possible, in accordance with the system
established for his or her Department, on the prescribed standard form, to
reflect the typical performance of the employee being evaluated during the year
since the last such awarding of points. He or she shall then recommend at which
class the employee being evaluated should be placed and shall submit the form
to each employee for his or her signature and indication of acceptance or
protest of the evaluation and recommendation. The employee shall return the
form to his or her Supervisor within ten days after receipt thereof.
   (c)   Any employee protesting the evaluation or the recommendation of his or
her Supervisor may appeal in accordance with subsection (f) hereof.
   (d)   Once the Supervisor has obtained the signature of each employee in his
or her Department, he or she shall submit the form to his or her Department
Director who shall approve or reject the Supervisor's recommendations as to
which class an employee should be placed in, within ten days after receipt
thereof. The class in which an employee is placed shall become effective on the
next immediate anniversary date of such employee.
   (e)   An employee protesting the decision of his or her Department Director
may appeal in accordance with subsection (f) hereof.
   (f)   An employee appealing either the evaluation or the recommendation of
his or her Supervisor, or the decision of his or her Department Director, shall
first appear before the Grievance Committee established by the rules and
regulations of each Department. Any employee appealing the decision of the
Committee relating to evaluation, recommendation or decision as it affects his
or her class, shall then appear before the Civil Service Commission, whose
decision shall be final. Notice of appeal to either the Committee or the
Commission must be presented within ten days after the action precipitating the
appeal occurs.

248.01 REQUISITION FOR PURCHASE.
   (a)   Generally. Purchases made under the authority of the City shall be
initiated by a requisition for purchase. This form may be initiated and/or
prepared by any employee or official of the City but must be signed by the
appropriate department supervisor.
   (b)   Exemptions to the Requisition Requirement. The purchase requisition
requirement does not pertain to normal monthly purchases such as utilities,
petroleum products for Municipally owned automobiles and trucks, or other
services directed by Council during the course of business proceedings,
provided that the bid requirement, if applicable, is satisfied and a record of
such proceedings appears in the Journal of Council.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72; Ord. 89-78. Passed 1-9-78.)
   (c)   Petty Purchase Options. For a purchase of up to twenty-five dollars
($25.00) a Petty Cash Fund, a charge account, or both, may be employed.
Council, by ordinance, may establish a Petty Cash Fund in an amount not to
exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for an official or a department. However,
a Petty Cash Fund for the administration in City Hall may not exceed four
hundred dollars ($400.00). This Fund is to provide reimbursement to all
departments, boards and commissions that do not have a Petty Cash Fund. Such
Fund may be replenished either when depleted to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or
monthly. When applying to the appropriate department director to reimburse the
Petty Cash Fund, a requisition for purchase shall be submitted. This
requisition shall include a complete listing with receipts for all material
which has been procured. The appropriate department director shall present the
requisition to the appropriate committee of Council for review at such
committee’s next meeting. The requisition can become a matter of discussion but
it cannot be disapproved. The appropriate committee of Council may authorize an
official or a department to open a charge account. Such committee shall
determine the maximum amount which may be charged during one month, the person
or persons who may charge such amounts and any other rules it may deem
desirable. The department supervisor shall be responsible for recording, in a
manner of his choosing, each item purchased through a charge account, the date,
the amount and the person who charged such purchase, where the vendor from whom
such purchases are made does not provide this kind of recordation. The periodic
statements of the vendor shall be presented to the appropriate committee of
Council for review at such committee’s next meeting. Such statements can become
a matter of discussion but they or individual items upon them cannot be
disapproved. In the instance of either option, the requirements of the
requisition, the signature of the department supervisor, the verbal quotes and
approval by the appropriate department director do not pertain to individual
purchases. With a Petty Cash Fund the requisition is for requesting
reimbursement only. An itemized list of charge account items shall appear on
the next monthly payment listing, as described in Section 248.07. Such
itemization does not mean that individual checks must be issued; as much
grouping as practical is encouraged. Receipts for procured material and
statements from vendors shall constitute the documents to be assembled by the
Finance Director. See Section
248.09(b).
(Ord. 35-91. Passed 6-11-91; Ord. 21-2023. Passed 6-27-23.)
248.02 BID REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Generally. For a purchase of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000), a
minimum of three verbal quotes shall be obtained and noted on the requisition
therefor. For a purchase of over ten thousand dollars ($10,000) up to the
maximum amount stated in Section 735.05 of the Ohio Revised Code, a minimum of
three quotes shall accompany the requisition therefor, two of which shall be
written. A purchase over the maximum amount stated in Section 735.05 of the
Ohio Revised Code shall be made in accordance with Section
224.01.
   (b)   Blanket Orders. A requisition for purchase may be valid for a period
of up to one fiscal year and involve numerous goods and services from one
vendor. A single set of quotes shall satisfy the bid requirement for all of the
materials to be purchased from each vendor. The City may prepare "blanket"
certificates in accordance with R.C. § 5705.41, not to exceed current
appropriations and two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for each "blanket"
certificate.
   (c)   Waiver of Multiple Bid Requirement.  
      (1)   If the appropriate department director determines that only one bid
can be obtained for particular goods or services or that such items have been
purchased within three months for a purchase of up to ten thousand dollars
($10,000), he or she may present the reasons to City Council when he or she
presents the requisition, and Council may waive the multiple bid requirement
for the particular purchase. If City Council determines that only one bid can
be obtained for particular goods or services for a purchase of over ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), and up to the maximum amount stated in R.C. §
735.05, Council may waive the multiple bid requirement for the particular
purchase.
      (2)   In all cases of expenditures exceeding bidding threshold set forth
in R.C. § 735.05, the requirements of division (a) of this section may be
waived by Council if the expenditure falls within one of following categories.
In all cases, the purchase shall be approved by Council.
         A.   Purchase from the state under R.C. § 125.04 or 5513.01;
         B.   Purchase from a governmental body;
         C.   Purchase of a unique professional service;
         D.   Emergency purchases as described in Section
248.10;
         E.   Purchases incapable of being competitively bid, such as a sole
source providers;
         F.   Purchases from another supplier upon equivalent terms,
conditions, and specifications.
(Ord. 54-2002. Passed 4-23-02; Ord. 62-2021. Passed 12-28-21.)
248.03 APPROVALS.
   (a)   Initial Presentation. Requisitions for purchases up to five thousand
dollars ($5,000) may be approved by the supervisor without the approval of
Council. A requisition shall be presented to the appropriate department
director for a purchase of over five thousand dollars ($5,000) and up to ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), and to Council. If disapproved, the requisition
shall be so marked, signed and dated by the appropriate department director and
returned to the department supervisor. If approved, the requisition shall be so
marked, signed and dated by the appropriate department director or the Mayor.
   (b)   Council Disapproval. If Council disapproves the requisition, it shall
be returned to the department supervisor, marked "Rejected by Council", with
the date and the Clerk of Council's signature.
   (c)   Recordation. The Clerk of Council shall record the disposition of the
requisition, whether approved or disapproved, in the Journal of the Proceedings
of Council.
(Ord. 86-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 62-2021. Passed 12-28-21.)
248.04 PURCHASES.
   (a)   Verification: Purchase Order and Certification. Monthly utility
invoices and other monthly invoices already authorized by Council may be paid
immediately upon receipt by the Finance Director. All purchases may be paid for
by the Finance Director after an approval process established by the Finance
Department and a purchase order has been issued. If Council approves the
requisition, it shall be presented to the Finance Director, who shall verify
from the vendor the purchase price indicated on the requisition. If verified,
the Finance Director shall issue, within three days (excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays), a purchase order, bearing the purchase order number, in
a sequence of his or her choosing, and including a certificate. Such
certificate shall certify that the amount required for the purchase has been
appropriated and is in the Treasury or in the process of collection to the
credit of the appropriate fund free from any previous encumbrances.
   (b)   Inability to Certify. If the Finance Director cannot so certify, he or
she shall attach a statement to the requisition and shall present a copy of
that statement, other than the original, to the Mayor, the appropriate
department director and the department supervisor, and Council if the initial
requisition was approved by Council.
   (c)   Submission of Purchase Order. The Finance Director shall submit the
purchase order with certificate to the vendor. One copy of the purchase order
with certificate, other than the original, shall be retained by the Finance
Director and a second such copy shall be presented to the department supervisor
for record purposes.
(Ord. 79-2007. Passed 12-11-07; Ord. 21-2023. Passed 6-27-23.)
248.05 WAYBILLS.
   Upon receipt of the purchased material, the person receiving the material
shall sign and date the waybill. A copy of this bill shall then be presented to
the Finance Director. The department supervisor shall be responsible for
determining any discrepancy between items requisitioned and items received.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72; Ord. 89-78. Passed 1-9-79.)
248.06 INVOICES.
   (a)   Comparison of Invoice With Requisition. Upon receipt of the invoice
from the vendor, the Finance Director shall compare the amount of the invoice
with the purchase price indicated on the requisition.
   (b)   Discrepancy Between Invoice. If the Director discovers a discrepancy,
he shall report to the Mayor, the appropriate department director and the
department supervisor, and Council if the initial requisition was approved by
Council.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72; Ord. 21-2023. Passed 6-27-23.)
248.07 MONTHLY PAYMENT LISTING.
   At the normal time for the preparation of the monthly financial report, the
Finance Director shall complete a payment listing, listing all normal monthly
payments otherwise authorized by Council and all payments paid under the
provisions of this chapter, and the total of all such items. These payment
listings shall have their own numerical sequence, dollar amount, payee name,
description of payment, and date of payment.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72; Ord. 21-2023. Passed 6-27-23.)
248.08 PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE TO PAY BILLS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Section 248.08 was repealed by Ordinance 21-2023, passed
June 27, 2023.)
248.09 PAYMENT OF BILL.
   (a)   Checks to be Issued. The Finance Director shall issue checks or other
negotiable instruments to pay the bills. He shall retain a copy, other than the
original, for record purposes.
   (b)   Documents to be Assembled. The Director shall assemble all of the
documents related to each individual purchase, which shall consist of:
      (1)   The requisition for purchase, with written quotes (if any);
      (2)   The purchase order with certificate (if any);
      (3)   A copy of the waybill;
      (4)   The invoice;
      (5)   A copy of the check issued by the City to pay the bill; and
      (6)   Correspondence or any other document (if any).
   He shall then gather into one place the documents so assembled for all of
the purchases listed in each individual ordinance to pay bills and retain these
documents for record purposes.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72.)
248.10 EMERGENCY PURCHASES.
   Occasionally a purchase may be required on an emergency basis. Emergency
action is authorized when and only when the health, safety or welfare of the
people is actually in jeopardy. To authorize an emergency purchase,
requirements including, but not limited to, the requisition for purchase, the
applicable bid requirement, approval by the applicable official or groups of
officials, and verification, preparation of the purchase order, and
certification, if applicable, must be satisfied. However, to expedite the
approval by applicable groups of officials, the following steps may be taken:
   (a)   If a committee of Council is required to approve, a meeting of the
committee shall be called, and if such meeting is impractical, the appropriate
department director or the Chairman of that committee may poll all of the
members who can be reached either in person, by telephone or by other
electronic means, and proceed if a majority of the committee approves.
   (b)   If Council is required to approve, a special meeting of Council shall
be called, and if such meeting is impractical, the Mayor or the Chairman of the
appropriate committee of Council may poll all of the members who can be reached
either in person, by telephone (by conference call, if possible) or by other
electronic means, and proceed if a majority of Council approves.
   (c)   Any member of council may specifically request that any poll pursuant
to paragraphs (a) or (b), above, be conducted in person or by telephone. Such
request shall be made in writing to the Clerk of Council.
   Approval or disapproval by a majority of Council, if required, shall be
recorded by the Clerk of Council in the Journal of the proceedings of Council.
Such meetings shall be called (or such polls shall be conducted) as soon as is
reasonably possible, but if one is not called (or conducted) within three days
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays), the applicable official may
proceed as if a majority of the committee, or Council, had approved. For the
purposes of this section, the Mayor or any member of the appropriate committee
of Council shall have the power to call a committee meeting, if required, and
the Mayor or any three members of Council shall have the power to call a
special meeting of Council, if required. In either instance, if the Mayor calls
the meeting, he shall cause to be delivered written notice of that meeting to
the residence of each committee member or member of Council. Failure to obtain
a quorum, after diligent effort to do so, shall have the same effect as failure
to call a meeting.
(Ord. 11-2012. Passed 3-13-12.)
248.11 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Department supervisor” means either an employee of the City, such as
the Police Chief, the Fire Chief or the Service Director in the Service
Department.
   (b)   “The appropriate department director” mean as follows:
 
Department             Department Director
Safety (Police & Fire) Safety Director
Service                Service Director
Law                    Law Director
Finance                Finance Director
 
   These designations shall be subject to modification upon additions or
deletions of departments, boards, commissions or committees of Council.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72; Ord. 62-2021. Passed 12-28-21.)
248.12 ABSENCE OF FINANCE DIRECTOR.
   Throughout this chapter, where specific action by the Finance Director is
required, in the absence of the Finance Director, the Assistant Finance
Director so designated by the Finance Director may fulfill the necessary
functions.
(Ord. 48-2005. Passed 6-28-05.)
248.13 AUTHORITY OF FINANCE COMMITTEE.
   The Finance Committee shall, with the approval of a majority of the members
of Council, establish such other purchasing procedures and requirements as it
may deem desirable.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72.)
248.14 RETROACTIVE AUTHORIZATIONS.
   Council may retroactively authorize any purchase not made in conformity with
these rules, either separately or as part of a list of such purchases, but such
authorization shall be at the discretion of Council. Any person acting without
authorization shall be deemed personally liable for the amount of the debt
incurred, regardless of whether the City has benefitted from the purchase in
question, and such item shall be considered as having been a gift to the
Municipality from the person making it, unless Council retroactively authorizes
the purchase.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72.)
248.15 EXEMPTIONS TO THE AUTHORIZED PURCHASE PROCEDURE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall apply to purchases initiated by ordinance or
resolution, or to expenditures otherwise provided for by these Codified
Ordinances or other ordinances of the City.
(Ord. 52-72. Passed 10-10-72.)
248.16 VARIATIONS.
   (a)   Generally. The authorized purchase procedure provided in this chapter
is a general document. It does not attempt, nor can it attempt, to cover every
conceivable situation arising from its use. Certain specifics will be resolved
by control mechanisms built into the procedure. Approval of requisitions for
purchase and the amounts of items and the purposes for which such amounts have
been appropriated in the annual appropriation ordinances would be examples. In
the first example there is nothing to prevent department directors, committees
of Council or Council as a whole from formulating policies governing their
approvals of various requisitions. Such policy formulation can be expected. One
important matter of policy appears in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Preparation of Specifications Prior to Requesting Quotations. Whenever
it is practical, specifications should be prepared by the initiator of the
requisition or someone else designated by whomever will approve the requisition
before bids are requested from prospective vendors. Generally, such preparation
should occur when the purchase is for more than fifty dollars ($50.00).
Specifications should be in writing and furnished to prospective vendors if the
purchase is for more than two hundred dollars ($200.00). They should describe
the item in enough detail and in a manner so that several vendors, not just one
or two, can bid, so that the vendors are bidding on the same size, shape, type,
quality, options, etc., of such item, and so that there is a reasonable chance
the quotes are truly equivalent and, hence, comparable.
   (c)   Absence of the Finance Director. In the absence of the Finance
Director, the Assistant Finance Director so designated by the Finance Director
should be able to do any of the steps in the authorized purchase procedure
where the Finance Director is to perform the step. If there is no Finance
Committee directive to the contrary, it can be assumed that such Assistant
Finance Director can do all such steps, which are found in Sections
248.04 through
248.07 and
248.09. However, it should be noted that the Finance Director is delegating
these duties to such Assistant Finance Director and, hence, is ultimately
responsible for properly carrying out these steps.   
   (d)   Housing of Prisoners. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to
issue a purchase order for the transfer and housing of prisoners at jail
facilities operated by other governmental entities where such prisoners have
been charged with and convicted of violating a traffic or criminal ordinance or
statute within the City.
(Ord. 49-2005. Passed 6-28-05.)
248.17 ENFORCEMENT
   The Finance Director shall be responsible for the enforcement of this
chapter, except that the Director is not responsible for the enforcement of the
duties of the Clerk of Council as set forth in this chapter. Failure to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall render the affected
requisition null and void and its disposition shall be in accordance with
Section
248.14.
(Ord. 24-87. Passed 2-24-87.)
248.18 PARTICIPATION IN OHIO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING PROGRAM.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby granted authority, in the name of the City, to
participate in contracts of the Ohio Department of Transportation for the
purchase of machinery, materials, supplies or other articles which the
Department has entered into pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5513.01(B).
   (b)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to agree, in the name of the City, to
be bound by all contract terms and conditions as the Ohio Department of
Transportation prescribes.
   (c)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to agree, in the name of the City, to
directly pay the vendors under each such contract of the Department in which
the City participates, for items it receives pursuant to the contract.
   (d)   The City agrees to hold the Director and the Department harmless for
any claim or dispute arising out of participation in a contract pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 5513.01(B).
(Res. 5-97. Passed 1-28-97.)
248.19 PARTICIPATION IN OHIO DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COOPERATIVE
PURCHASING PROGRAM.
   (a)   The Mayor hereby requests authority in the name of the City to
participate in State contracts which the Ohio Department of Administrative
Services, Office of State Purchasing, has entered into for the purchase of
supplies, services, equipment and certain materials pursuant to Ohio R.C.
125.04.
   (b)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to agree in the name of the City to be
bound by all contract terms and conditions as the Ohio Department of
Administrative Services, Office of State Purchasing, prescribes. Such terms and
conditions may include a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs which
the Department incurs as a result of the City's participation in a contract.
Further, the Mayor hereby agrees to be bound by all such terms and conditions.
   (c)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to agree in the name of the City to
directly pay the vendor, under each such State contract in which it
participates, for items it receives pursuant to the contract, and the Mayor
does hereby agree to directly pay the vendor.
(Ord. 144-87. Passed 12-8-87.)

254.01 SCOPE; FULL-TIME CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE DEFINED.
   There is set forth in this chapter conditions of employment for all full-
time classified employees of the City, except those employees covered by a
current collective bargaining agreement, referred to in this chapter as
employees. As used in this chapter, "full-time classified employee" means an
employee who works more than thirty hours per week in any thirty weeks during a
twelve-month period and who has previously taken and passed a competitive civil
service examination of the type used to fill full-time positions within the
classified service of the City. "City" means the Mayor, Council and
departmental directors and supervisors.
(Ord. 59-91. Passed 7-9-91.)
254.02 EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   Council recognizes a responsibility to consult with employees covered by
this chapter for making changes in the provisions of this chapter, specifically
reserving, however, its right to make such changes and take such disciplinary
actions as are necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and
general welfare of the City. Unless otherwise changed, this chapter shall be
effective as of January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, and thereafter
until specifically amended by a following ordinance, which may be retroactive
in its effect. It is understood and agreed between the City and an employee
covered by this chapter that by the City's recognition of its responsibility to
consult with such employee prior to making changes, and by its agreement to
make any further ordinances retroactive as stated in this section, such
employee commencing work under this chapter, when it is fully effective, agrees
to be individually bound to work under the terms and conditions of this
chapter, and further agrees to be subject to injunctive action in case of any
work stoppage.
(Ord. 106-87. Passed 10-27-87.)
254.03 PAYROLL; BASE SALARY RATE.
   (a)   All employees and officials shall be paid a minimum of once each
month, not later than the last day of each month. Full-time employees and
officials, and other employees or officials whom the Director of Finance deems
appropriate, shall be paid semimonthly on the fifteenth day of each month and
on the last day of each month. Each appropriate supervisor shall submit the
payroll for his or her department to the Director not later than three working
days after the close of each payroll period. The Director shall determine and
make those payroll deductions which he or she deems appropriate or which are
otherwise authorized and directed by Council. All payroll changes shall be made
at a time and in a manner which the Director deems appropriate. When such
payday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the preceding Friday shall be the payday
and the payroll submission of those days shall be adjusted accordingly.
   The base salary rate of any full-time classified employee shall be
calculated by dividing his or her annual salary by the total number of regular
working hours per year. Such total number of regular working hours per year for
all classified employees shall be as follows: Police, 2,080 hours; Dispatch
Division, 2,080 hours; Fire, 2,756; Service, 2,080; and Building, 2,080.
   (b)   In any event, the Director may withhold the payment of overtime to
employees or officials for a period not to exceed fifteen days, or until the
pay day of the pay period immediately following the period in which the
overtime was worked, in order to obtain accurate and necessary information and
reporting from the various departments regarding such overtime.
(Ord. 40-93. Passed 5-25-93; Res. 103-95. Passed 11-28-95.)
254.04 TRANSFERABILITY OF SERVICE TIME.
   Years of service as an employee of another governmental agency shall not be
transferable, unless the employee transfers from a position which is the same
as, or, in the opinion of the Civil Service Commission, is equivalent to, the
position to which the employee is initially appointed in the City, but in no
event shall the number of years so transferred exceed five. Each year begins
with the employee's first pay period following his or her anniversary of
employment by the City, and in no event shall years of such service be
calculated from an anniversary earlier than the first anniversary of the merger
between the former Villages of Olmsted Falls and West View, namely January 1,
1972.
(Ord. 106-87. Passed 10-27-87.)
254.05 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Each employee shall be entitled, for each completed eighty hours of
service, to sick leave of 4.6 hours with pay. However, such sick leave shall
not be accumulated on overtime hours, but only on regular hours of service.
Employees may use sick leave, upon approval of the responsible administrative
officer in the employee's department, for absence due to personal illness,
pregnancy, injury, exposure to contagious disease which would be communicated
to other employees, and illness or injury in the employee's immediate family.
Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without limit. When sick leave is used it
shall be deducted from the employee's credit on the basis of one hour for every
one hour of absence from previously scheduled work. However, when sick leave is
used for injury or exposure to contagious disease received on duty from a
patient who has received emergency medical treatment, which occurs while the
employee is on duty, it shall not be deducted from the employee's credit. The
previously accumulated sick leave of an employee who has been separated from
public service may be placed to his or her credit upon his or her re-employment
in public service, provided that such re-employment takes place within ten
years of the date on which the employee was last terminated from public
service. An employee who transfers to the City from a different public agency
shall be credited with the unused balance of his or her accumulated sick leave
up to a maximum of 500 hours. Each department supervisor is authorized to
establish and publish regulations concerning sick leave and shall require the
employee to furnish a satisfactory written, signed statement to justify the use
of sick leave, provided that the same is not in conflict with Civil Service
Commission regulations. If medical attention is required, a certificate stating
the nature of the illness shall be required from the attending physician
justifying the use of sick leave. Falsification of either a written, signed
statement or a physician's certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary
action, including dismissal.
   As used in this section,"contagious disease" means a disease recorded in the
medical records of the transported patient and which is infectious in nature,
but does not include common ailments such as influenza, the common cold, etc.
 
   (b)   Any employee whose employment is terminated, for any reason
whatsoever, after five or more years of public service with the City, may
elect, at the time of termination, to be paid in cash for one-fourth of unused
sick leave credit. Such payment shall be calculated by multiplying one-fourth
of unused sick leave credit hours by the total of the previous two years of
salary of the employee and then dividing the resulting product by 4.160 if the
employee is a member of the Police Department, the Dispatcher Division, the
Service Department or the Building Department. However, such payment for an
employee of the Fire Department shall be calculated based on 5,824. Such
payment shall eliminate all unused sick leave credit accrued by the employee at
that time. Any employee who is terminated, for any reason whatsoever, after ten
or more years of public service with the City, may elect, at the time of
termination, to be paid in cash for forty percent of unused sick leave credit.
The calculation of such sick leave credit shall be computed as previously
provided. Such unused sick leave shall be payable to the surviving spouse in
the event the employee’s death.
(Ord. 106-87. Passed 10-27-87.)
254.055 LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Employees paid by the City may donate paid leave to a fellow employee
who is otherwise eligible to accrue and use sick leave pursuant to the
provisions of this section. As used in this section, “paid leave” means sick
leave, personal leave or vacation leave. The intent of the Leave Donation
Program is to allow employees to voluntarily provide assistance to their co-
workers who are in critical need of leave due to the serious illness or injury
of the employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family. As used in this
section, “immediate family” means a spouse, child, mother or father.
   (b)   An employee may receive donated leave, up to the number of hours the
employee is scheduled to work each pay period or as provided in paragraph (b)
(4) of this rule, if the employee who is to receive donated leave:
      (1)   Or a member of that employee’s immediate family has a serious
illness or injury;
      (2)   Has no accrued leave;
      (3)   Has not been approved to receive other employment related benefits;
and
      (4)   Has applied for any leave, Workers’ Compensation, or benefits
program for which the employee is eligible. An employee who has applied for
these programs may use donated leave to satisfy the waiting period for such
benefits, when applicable. After the waiting period, donated leave may be used
up to an amount equal to the benefit for which the employee applied, (e.g.,
seventy percent for disability leave benefits) while the employee’s application
is pending approval.
   (c)   Employees may donate leave if the donating employee:
      (1)   Voluntarily elects to donate leave and does so with the
understanding that donated leave will not be returned;
      (2)   Donates a minimum of eight hours; and
      (3)   Retains a combined leave balance of at least eighty hours, of which
forty- eight (48) hours must be personal days. Leave shall be donated in the
same manner in which it would otherwise be used.
   (d)   The Leave Donation Program shall be administered on a pay period by
pay period basis. Employees using donated leave shall be considered in active
pay status and shall accrue leave and be entitled to any benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Leave accrued by an employee while using donated
leave shall be used, if necessary, in the following pay period before
additional donated leave may be received. Donated leave shall not count toward
the probationary period of an employee who receives donated leave during his or
her probationary period. Donated leave shall be considered sick leave, but
shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
   
   (e)   Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
      (2)   The type of leave and number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   That the employee will have a minimum combined leave balance of at
least eighty hours; and
      (4)   That the leave is donated voluntarily and the employee understands
that the donated leave will not be returned.
   (f)   The City shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate leave.
The City shall respect an employees’ right to privacy, however, the City may,
with the permission of the employee who is in need of leave or a member of the
employee’s immediate family, inform employees of their co-workers’ critical
need for leave. The City shall not directly solicit leave donations from
employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a strictly voluntary basis.
(Ord. 84-2004. Passed 12-28-04.)
254.06 HOSPITALIZATION INSURANCE.
   Except as otherwise provided in these Codified Ordinances, the City shall
provide each full-time employee with coverage under a group insurance policy
underwritten by an insurance carrier of the City’s choice, as determined from
time to time by Council, unless an eligible employee elects not to accept such
coverage. Such policy shall provide both hospital and surgical indemnity in
such an amount and under such terms as Council may from time to time determine.
Where an employee’s family is eligible for coverage under such policy, the City
shall provide such family coverage. Each employee shall contribute the sum of
twenty dollars ($20.00) per month toward the premium of the hospitalization
insurance coverage provided herein. If the City is unable to obtain coverage
for any specific employee or group of employees due to underwriting
requirements of the insurance carrier, the City shall take such steps as
Council determines advisable, but in no event does the City guarantee the
availability of such coverage and in no event shall the employee be entitled to
any supplementary reimbursement as the result of the inability of the City to
obtain such coverage for him or her.

benefit plan as it deems fiscally affordable. (Ord. 12-95. Passed 2-28-95.)

twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000). However, coverage for the Chief of
Police, the Chief of Fire and the Dispatcher Division has a face value amount
of twenty-four thousand dollars ($24,000). Such policy shall provide accidental
death benefits to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by each employee,
or to the beneficiaries specified in the condition of such policy if no
beneficiary designation is on file. No employee contribution shall be required.
If the City is unable to obtain coverage for any specific employee or group of
employees, such employee or group of employees shall not be entitled to any
supplementary reimbursement.

explanations can be provided by the appropriate insuring organizations'
representatives.

   (g)   Reporting Requirements.
      (1)   Any employee who has knowledge that another employee is
inappropriately using it resources, must report this to his/her supervisor
immediately.
         (Ord. 27-2011. Passed 4-12-11.)
254.38 PHONE USAGE.
   (a)   Purpose. The primary purpose of this policy is to establish
fundamental rules for the use of City issued cell phones, city phones and
personal cell phones. The use of a cell phone while driving presents a hazard
to the driver, other employees and the general public. This policy is meant to
ensure the safe operation of City vehicles and equipment and the operation of
private vehicles and equipment while an employee is on work time and conducting
City business.
   (b)   Statement of Policy.
      (1)   Personal telephone calls are to be kept to a minimum. City issued
cell phones generally are to be used only for City business. Employees may not
use cell phones to conduct business for others or themselves.
      (2)   Employees assigned a city issued cell phone shall, during business
hours have the phone fully charged, turned on and with them.
      (3)   No phones are to be used for illegal activities.
      (4)   All employees are required to keep a daily log of long distance
calls made from city phones. These logs are to be turned in to the Finance
Department at the end of the month, at which time they will be checked off
against the records of the telephone company.
**Definition of Long Distance: is defined as any call that creates a charge in
addition to the basic charges for phone service.
      (5)   Unless otherwise authorized, City provided cell phones must be used
only for business purposes. In addition, employees should use a City provided
cell phone only when a less costly alternative does not exist, e.g. Check phone
voice mail from a land line.
      (6)   Employees must reimburse the City the cost of any personal use of a
city phone or personal use of a City issued cell phone.
      (7)   Cell phones and accessories (e.g., battery chargers) remain City
property. To the extent permitted by applicable law, employees will be
responsible for lost or stolen cell phones, etc. belonging to the City.
Employees must immediately report lost, stolen, damaged, or malfunctioning cell
phones to the Finance Director.
      (8)   Employees are prohibited from using cell phones while driving or
operating equipment. Should an employee need to make a city business call while
driving, he/she should locate a lawfully designated area to park and make the
call.
      (9)   Generally, confidential information is not to be discussed over
cell phones.
      (10)   Violation of this policy will subject an employee to disciplinary
action up to and including dismissal.
         (Ord. 25-2012. Passed 4-10-12.)
254.39 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   (a)   Corrective Action.
      (1)   Department Directors and supervisors, and the City Appointing
Authorities shall follow this system of corrective discipline when correcting
job behavior.
      (2)   This policy is a guide for uniform administration of discipline. It
neither delegates nor limits the powers and duties conferred upon the City, its
Departments or Appointing Authority by the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)   This policy provides standard penalties for specific offenses. The
examples of specific offenses given in each grouping are merely illustrative,
not designed to be all-inclusive.
      (4)   The inclusion of standard penalties in this policy does not
preclude the application of a more or less severe penalty for an infraction
when circumstances warrant it. In any case where a non-standard penalty is
imposed, the reason for deviation must be reduced to writing and sent by the
supervisor to the Appointing Authority administering the discipline.
      (5)   Disciplinary records shall cease to have any force and effect and
shall be removed from an employee's personnel file upon request 24 months after
the date the discipline was imposed if there has been no other discipline
imposed during the past 24 months.
      (6)   Where this policy conflicts with a relevant Collective Bargaining
Unit the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall prevail.
   (b)   Types of Corrective Action.
      (1)   Oral Reprimand/Verbal Counseling. Supervisors or Department Heads
shall address unsatisfactory behavior promptly by discussing the problem with
the employee and counseling more suitable behavior. Such counseling shall be
reduced to writing. The original shall be forwarded to the Finance Department
and placed in the employee's personnel folder and a copy given to the employee.
      (2)   Written Reprimand/Written Warning. If verbal counseling does not
resolve misbehavior or where more severe action is warranted, supervisors and
Department Heads may issue written reprimands/warnings. The original shall be
forwarded to the Finance Department and placed in the employee's personnel
folder and a copy given to the employee.
      (3)   Suspension.  If verbal counseling or written reprimands/warnings
fail or where more severe action is warranted, department heads may recommend a
working suspension or a suspension from work, without pay. Such recommendation
will be reduced to writing and the original shall be forwarded to the Finance
Department and placed in the employee's personnel folder and a copy given to
the employee.
      (4)   Demotion. If reprimands and suspensions fail, department heads may
recommend demotion. Demotion is an involuntary reduction of an employee in
classification and job duties for just cause. A demotion may or may not, result
in an immediate reduction in pay. Such recommendation will be reduced to
writing and the original shall be forwarded to the Finance Department and
placed in the employee's personnel folder and a copy given to the employee.
      (5)   Dismissal. If lesser disciplinary actions fail or the offense is
such that the most severe action is warranted, employees may be discharged.
Employees being considered for discharge may be suspended with pay. Such
recommendation will be reduced to writing and the original shall be forwarded
to the Finance Department and placed in the employee's personnel folder and a
copy given to the employee.
   Note:   Certain offenses may warrant immediate dismissal.
   (c)   Grounds for Disciplinary Action and Penalties.
      (1)   The Group I, II and III Offenses which follow illustrate the kinds
of offenses which historically warrant the penalties established for the group.
      (2)   In general, Group I Offenses are of a relatively minor nature. They
cause only a minimal disruption to the organization in terms of a slight yet
significant decrease in organizational productivity, efficiency and/or morale.
If ignored, Group I Offenses usually cause only temporary or minor impact to
the organization unless they are compounded over time.
      (3)   Group II Offenses are more serious than Group I Offenses. They
cause a more serious and longer lasting disruption to the organization. If
ignored, Group II Offenses can have a more serious and longer lasting impact
against the organization than Group I Offenses.
      (4)   Group III Offenses are very serious or, possibly, criminal. They
cause a critical disruption to the organization. If ignored, Group III Offenses
cause long lasting and serious impact against the organization.

to calculate payroll and record time and attendance.
   (b)   Employees reporting to duty must be in uniform before clocking in at
their assigned work area.
   (c)   All employees must clock in before beginning any work. Employees shall
not perform any work before they have clocked in or after they have clocked out
without approval from their supervisors. Each week, all employees will place
their signature on the weekly time records and certify that all work they have
performed for that week was done after they clocked in and before they clocked
out and that they have not performed any work off-the-clock.
   (d)   Employees must clock in no earlier than six minutes prior to the start
of their shift and no later than six minutes after the end of their shift.
Clocking in and out within the time-frame specified above, will be calculated

of the lunch break and clock in at the conclusion of the lunch break. No work

work must clock out when they leave and then clock in when they return to work.
   (h)   Any employee who performs any work prior to clocking in or after
clocking out, or who performs any overtime work without prior approval of a

254.42 REDACTION OF NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION/RECORDS.
   (a)   While the public is guaranteed access to the City's public records,
the City has a further duty to respect the privacy rights of its employees. As
such, the city recognizes that not all information contained in an employee's
personnel file is subject to public disclosure. Consequently, the City will
redact confidential or other information identified under State law as not
subject to public disclosure prior to responding to a public records request
(be it a request to inspect and/or receive a copy of the public record). To
redact information means to black-out or remove the non-public information from
an otherwise public record before public disclosure of the record.
   (b)   The following information and/or items are not subject to public
disclosure, and shall be redacted from a public record prior to disclosure of
the record.

         A.   Such information is necessary to document the employee's
compliance with an employment requirement that the employee live in a specific

rel. Nix v. City of Cleveland 83 Ohio St. 3d 379 (1998).
   (c)   Redactions.
      (1)   Redactions are considered denials and, therefore, in making such
deletions, cities should report the legal authority that serves as the basis
for the removal of this information.
      (2)   Additionally, to the extent that an item is not a public record and
is "personal information," the City is under an affirmative duty to prevent its
disclosure. "Personal information" is defined as "any information that
describes anything about a person, or that indicates actions done by or to a
person, or that indicates that a person possesses certain personal
characteristics, and that contains, and can be retrieved from a system by a
name, identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to a person.
         (Ord. 57-2012. Passed 6-26-12.)

   (a)   The City maintains a personal information ("PI") system and shall do
so in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C. Section 1347. The City is
committed to only collecting, maintaining, and using the personal information
that is necessary and relevant to it carrying out the effective operation of
the City. All personal information maintained in the PI system shall be used in
a lawful manner for legitimate purposes consistent with the function of the
City.
   (b)   Personal information is defined as "any information that describes
anything about a person, or that indicates actions done by or to a person, or
that indicates that a person possesses certain personal characteristics, and
that contains, and can be retrieved from a system by, a name, identifying
number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to a person."
   (c)   The Mayor is directly responsible for the operation of the PI system,
including preparing and implementing rules that provide for the operation of
the information system. All employees responsible for collecting, maintaining,
and/or utilizing personal information maintained in the PI system shall be
provided a copy of any rules that are promulgated and trained in how to comply
with them and the provisions of the law.
   (d)   The City shall discipline any employee who engages in the unauthorized
use or release of the personal information contained in the PI system.
Disciplinary action shall be taken consistent with State and Federal law and
any applicable collective bargaining agreements, and may include action up to
and including termination.
   (e)   Whenever a person is requested to supply personal information that
will be maintained in the PI system, the person will be informed whether he/she
is legally required to provide the personal information. If he person is not
legally required to provide the personal information, he/she may refuse to
supply the information and no adverse consequences will be imposed as a result
of that refusal.
   (f)   The City shall take reasonable precautions to protect personal

required by Ohio law and polices of the City.
   (b)   Therefore, the City authorizes the use of credit cards in the
following manner:

Finance Director must be notified immediately.
      (2)   All purchases made with a credit card shall be preceded by an
approved purchase order.
      (3)   The Supervisor shall turn in all itemized receipts and appropriate
form(s) to the Finance Department at the end of the next business day upon the
employee's return to their normal work schedule. Failure to turn in receipts
and appropriate form(s) may result in the charges being deemed unrelated or
unsubstantiated. The user shall be responsible for any unsubstantiated or
unrelated purchases.
      (4)   The applicable department supervisor is responsible for keeping a
record of all credit card use. Any repayment of any unsubstantiated or
unrelated purchases will also be the responsibility of such employee and

who are ex-officio members.
(Ord. 71-85. Passed 12-23-85; Ord. 26-2022. Passed 3-14-23.)
280.02 OFFICERS; PROCEDURES.
   The officers of the Shade Tree Commission shall be a Chairman, a Vice-

280.03 PROGRAM; GUIDELINES; BUDGET; OTHER DUTIES.
   (a)   The program of the Shade Tree Commission is to study, formulate and

   (b)   To effect regulation of the planting, maintenance and removal of trees
and shrubs in the streets of, and on public property owned by, the City, the
Commission shall establish and may subsequently amend, subject to ratification

by the developer, in such amount as determined by Council upon recommendation
of the Commission.
   (d)   The Service Director can provide to the commission, if requested, the
fiscal year's budget or remaining funds. The Service Director can inform the

trimming, and the replanting of new tree's within the City's public right-of-
way.
   (e)    The Commission shall act as trustee for any property, assets or funds
donated to the City for the planting or preservation of trees and shrubs,
whether or not the donor has designated the Commission as such trustee. The
Commission is hereby conferred the powers and duties necessary to carry out the
purposes of the trust.

trees and shrubs related to said applicant. The Commission shall issue its
findings to the requesting board or commission no later than thirty calendar
days after said board or commission's request for advice.

TITLE TEN - JUDICIAL
Chapter
290. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Olmsted Falls
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an
Olmsted Falls ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Olmsted Falls, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate shall require
the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of record in
Cuyahoga County (the Berea Municipal Court) and the magistrate shall thereupon
certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued
costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of record.
However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in
petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall
be tried by the court unless he demands a jury trial. The jurisdiction of a
Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic
Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23, and the defendant waives his right to a jury trial in writing, a mayor
may try the case only if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly
dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive
and administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the
financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be
taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Olmsted Falls ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operator's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (DWI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

(Ord. 2-75. Passed 2-11-75; Ord. 100-2000. Passed 12-27-00.)
406.03 POWERS OF CHIEF OF POLICE.
   The Chief of Police is hereby empowered to:
   (a)   Designate and mark lanes to be used by traffic moving in a particular
direction regardless of the centerline of the roadway;
   (b)   Erect signs directing slow-moving traffic to use a designated lane or
allocating specified lanes to traffic moving in the same direction;
   (c)   Designate those portions of any street, where overtaking and passing
other traffic or driving to the left of the center or centerline of the roadway
would be especially hazardous, by appropriate signs or markings on the street
to indicate the beginning and end of such zones. Such zones may be marked by an
auxiliary yellow line placed parallel and to the right of the normal centerline
or offset marked lane line;
   (d)   Place markers, buttons or signs within or adjacent to intersections
and require that a specific course of direction be traveled by vehicles
proceeding in lanes by either permitting, prohibiting or requiring turns at
such intersections,

parallel or at a prescribed angle to the curb or edge of the roadway.
      (Ord. 2-75. Passed 2-11-75.)
406.04 POSTING OF SIGNS AND SIGNALS REQUIRED.
   No provision of this chapter shall be effective until signs, signals,
markings or other devices giving notice of such local traffic regulations are

   (a)   The Chief of Police shall provide the members of Council with a true
copy of each rule or regulation he adopts, modifies or repeals. No rule or
regulation shall become effective until thirty days after Council receives such
true copy, unless, by motion, by a majority vote of its members, Council waives

414.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
404.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
414.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:

auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section

allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device.

closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle, when
traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between such vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
such space without danger. This paragraph does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.

but the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these
divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. § 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician- paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))

      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or

request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension

will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.

driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the

first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).

when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. §

4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (G)(1)(b)(ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (G)(1)(c)(ii) and if,
within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by R.C.
§ 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender’s driver’s or occupational driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to
grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(5).

assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in
addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02(f) or
R.C. § 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic

result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section.

   (i)   Penalty for operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption.
Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited
driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any jail term
imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02
(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.

section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02

         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway. Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries. The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

   (g)   Pursuant to R.C. § 4511.21(G), points shall be assessed for violation
of a limitation under subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C.

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license

not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

analyzer to a motor vehicle’s ignition system, that is constantly available to
monitor the concentration by weight of alcohol in the breath of any person
attempting to start the motor vehicle by using its ignition system, and that
deters starting the motor vehicle by use of its ignition system unless the
person attempting to so start the vehicle provides an appropriate breath sample
for the device and the device determines that the concentration by weight of
alcohol in the person’s breath is below a preset level.
      (2)   “Offender with restricted driving privileges” means an offender who
is subject to an order that was issued under Ohio R.C. 4507.16(F) as a

         B.   Division (c)(2)A. above does not apply to an offender with
restricted driving privileges who breathes into an ignition interlock device or
starts a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device for the
purpose of providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)    The Municipality, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction,
upon application in writing and for good cause shown, may issue a special
permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the
maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in
conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any highway under its
jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.    Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)    The application for a permit shall be in the form that the
Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be
imposed and collected when any permit described in this section is issued. The
permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles. For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted
by the Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is
deemed a nondivisible load.
      (4)    The Municipality may issue or withhold a permit. If a permit is to
be issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for
the vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)    Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit. No person
shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)    Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
(Ord. 59-80. Passed 6-23-80.)
   (c)    Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)    No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)    The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)    For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)    Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)    Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

(R.C. § 4511.69)
452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.    Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.    Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would
endanger the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of
liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of this

bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any
penalty otherwise prescribed by the Traffic Code for that violation.

aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. (ORC 2901.04)

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)

misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is

after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
 606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
 
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerate such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
    (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section,
he or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or
her own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24; Ord. 81-73. Passed 12-11-73.)
606.10 FALSIFICATION.

following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding or other matter within its jurisdiction, either
orally or in a written document, including, but not limited to, an application,
petition, complaint or other pleading, or an inventory, account or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any
person harmed by the violation for injury, death, or loss to person or property
incurred as a result of the commission of the offense and for reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred as a result of
prosecuting the civil action commenced under this section. A civil action under
this section is not the exclusive remedy of a person who incurs injury, death,
or loss to person or property as a result of a violation of this section.

arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
606.22 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, "drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.23 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following.
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense,
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C.2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)

degree with a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fine. Repeated offenses
constitute a misdemeanor of the third degree with a maximum fine of five
hundred dollars ($500.00). The investigating officer, as defined in Section
959.132(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code, will evaluate the situation and educate
the owners on how to take remedial action to correct the violation. In

620.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Explosives" means any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that is
intended for the purpose of producing an explosion that contains any oxidizing
and combustible units or other ingredients in such proportions, quantities or
packing that an ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion or
by a detonator of any part of the compound or mixture may cause such a sudden
generation of highly heated gases that the resultant gaseous pressures are
capable of producing destructive effects on contiguous objects, or of
destroying life or limb. Manufactured articles shall not be held to be
explosives when the individual units contain explosives in such limited
quantities, of such nature or in such packing, that it is impossible to procure
a simultaneous or a destructive explosion of such units, to the injury of life,
limb or property, by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion or by a
detonator, such as fixed ammunition for small arms, firecrackers or safety fuse
matches.

or flame resistant construction.
   (37)   Signs: Contents: Placement. The premises on which a permanent
magazine is located shall be conspicuously marked by signs containing the words
"EXPLOSIVES KEEP OFF." Such signs shall adequately warn any person approaching
the magazine of the presence of explosives, but the sign shall not be so placed
as to direct general public attention to the location of the magazine.
   (38)   Location of Signs. No sign shall be placed on surface magazines or
barricades, or be so located that a bullet passing directly through the face of
the sign will strike the magazine.
   (39)   Combustible Materials on Premises. The area surrounding a magazine
for not less than fifty feet in all directions shall be kept free of rubbish,
dry grass or other combustible material.
   (40)   Persons Present. Blasting operations shall be carried on with the
smallest possible number of persons present.
   (41)   Diameter of Cartridges. The diameter of explosives cartridges shall
be of appropriate size to permit charging drill holes throughout their lengths
without either forcing or ramming explosives.
   (42)   Removal of Explosives from Wrappers. Explosives should not be removed
from the original wrapper before being loaded into bore holes except when
irregularities of the hole make it impossible to load whole cartridges with
safety, or in block holing where small charges are desirable. This rule shall
not apply to free running explosives.
   (43)   Ramming and Tamping. Excessive ramming should be avoided in loading
or tamping explosives in a bore hole. In tamping, only wooden tools of suitable
diameter with square cut ends and without exposed metal parts shall be used.
Plastic pipe with a wooden plug at the end should be used for long, small
diameter holes. When a tamping stick is used in charging drill holes, the force
of impact shall be insufficient to penetrate explosive cartridges. Primed
cartridges shall not be tamped.
   (44)   Loading Faces: Flying Material. No activity of a continuous nature,
nor more than two men engaged in intermittent work, shall be permitted in front
of a face being loaded with explosives and within the probable range of flying
material in the case of a premature blast. When steam equipment is being
employed or when primers containing electric blasting caps are employed, the
probable range of flying material shall be considered to be not less than 100
feet to one and one-half times the height of the face of the rock cut,
whichever is greater, provided that end clearance may be reduced by one-half.
   (45)   Free Running and Bulk Explosives. When loading free running or bulk
explosives, a bronze, wooden or heavy paper funnel shall be used unless the
explosives can be poured directly from a container into the hole in such a
manner as to prevent scattering of loose explosives around the collar of the
hole. The use of mechanical or pneumatic methods of loading is prohibited.
   (46)   Primers. Primers shall not be made up until just prior to loading
into the hole.
   (47)   Electric Blasting Caps: Leg Wires. Electric blasting caps used in
churn drill holes or any small bore holes shall always be tested with a
blasting galvanometer before any stemming is placed in the hole, and also
during loading whenever any question arises as to the condition of the leg
wires. The leg wires shall be short circuited after testing and remain so until
they are connected into the circuit.
   (48)   Leg Wire Shunt; Leading Wires. In short length small diameter bore
holes containing only one electric blasting cap the leg wire shunt shall be
left in place until connection is made either into the completed circuit or the
leading wires are coiled near the blasting area and shunted at the power
connection circuit or the leading wires are coiled near the blasting area and
shunted at the power connection end. Leading wires shall always be in the
blaster's possession, uncoiled or strung toward the power source, not grounded,
and before connection is made the circuit shall be tested with a blasting
galvanometer. If the circuit is defective, the leading wires shall be reshunted
and recoiled to the blasting area before investigation for the trouble. If a
defective cap or leg wire occurs in a bore hole, the stemming shall be removed
by compressed air or a water jet and a new primer inserted.
   (49)   Brand of Blasting Caps. In any single series and in the same blast,
electric blasting caps shall be the same brand.
   (50)   Prevention of Scattering; Rock Slides. When required by the City
Engineer, the area to be blasted shall be covered with strong woven matting or
rope or wire and a number of heavy logs or timbers securely tied together by
chains or cables of sufficient weight to prevent the scattering of the loosened
or shattered material. Displacement of such matting due to detonation shall be
kept to a minimum. Extreme care shall be exercised at all times to prevent rock
slides due to excessive vibration.
   (51)   Firing. A blast shall only be fired electrically with either a power
circuit or blasting machine, except that individual holes may be initiated with
electrical firing devices or detonating fuses. The method of fire shall at all
times be maintained in good operating condition. The efficiency of the blasting
machine shall be tested periodically to make certain that it can deliver power
at its rated capacity. The power circuit shall be energized by not less than
200 volts nor more than 500 volts. For alternating current, not less than forty
cycles per second shall be used.
   (52)   Power Circuits and Blasting Machines. When firing from a power
circuit, sufficient power shall be provided to supply ample current and voltage
requirements for each blast. When firing with a blasting machine, it shall not
be used for series or parallel series circuits, unless specifically designed
for parallel circuits and approved therefor. The explosives manufacturers
instructions shall be followed for all electric blasting, regardless of the
source of power.
   (53)   Wire Safety. The power wires, leading wires and connecting wires
shall be thoroughly insulated and kept from contact with any electrical
conductor, air lines or pools of water or oil. The leg wires of detonators
shall be kept short-circuited until connected into either the circuit or to the
shunted leading wires. All bare connections shall be either taped or blocked up
in position so as to prevent current leakage or entrance of stray or active
currents. While making connections in the blast area the leading wires shall be
kept short-circuited at the power source end but not grounded and shall remain
in the possession of the blaster. The leading wires shall then be strung from
the blast area toward the source of power to make the final connections to fire
the blast. Before connecting the leading wires to the power circuit, the
blaster shall make certain by a blasting galvanometer test that an unsafe
difference in potential does not exist between the two wires of a blasting
line. If the test shows either a short circuit or no circuit, the reshunted
leading wires shall be recoiled to the blast area before investigating for the
trouble.
   (54)   Contact of Lead Wires with Power Lines. Positive steps shall be taken
to prevent lead wires from being dislodged and making contact with overhead
high voltage electric power lines. Should accidental contact be made, the
blaster shall prevent any person from touching the blasting device and he shall
clear the area of all persons immediately. No person shall enter the area until
the blaster has notified the owner of the power line and the latter has
eliminated the danger of electric shock.
   (55)   Control of Power Circuit. A power circuit used for firing shall be
controlled by a switch located at a safe distance to be determined by the
blaster but not less than 150 feet from the blast area. Such switch when in
actual use shall be firmly fastened in position, thoroughly insulated against
grounds and wholly enclosed in a tight box that shall be kept closed and locked
at all times except while firing, and no person other than the blaster shall
have access to the switch. The switch shall be provided with a short circuit in
the "off" position and shall be so arranged that the box enclosure can be
locked only when the switch is in the "off" position.
   (56)   Firing by Power Circuit. When firing by means of a power circuit the
blasting circuit shall at all times be broken in at least one place by a gap of
at least five feet on the incoming side of the switch, except during the firing
operation.
   (57)   Firing by Blasting Machine. When firing with a blasting machine, it
shall be located not less than 150 feet from the blast area.
   (58)   Blasting Machine Leading Wires. When firing by means of a blasting
machine, the leading wires shall be kept short circuited until the shot is
ready for firing, shall not be connected to the blasting machine until
immediately before the tune of firing and shall be disconnected from the
blasting machine and short circuited immediately after firing.
   (59)   Testing of Detonator and Circuits. Electric detonators and blasting
circuits shall be tested only by means of a blasting galvanometer designed for
this purpose.
   (60)   Clearing of Danger Zone. Before firing any blast, all means of access
to the danger zone, the extent of which shall be determined by the blaster,
shall be effectively guarded to exclude all unauthorized personnel. The blaster
shall then sound a warning distinctly audible to all persons within the danger
zone and all such persons shall retire to a safe shelter. The danger zone shall
then be examined by the blaster to make certain that all persons have retired
therefrom to a place of safety. No blast shall be fired while any person is in
the danger zone.
   (61)   Pedestrian and Vehicular Traffic. It shall be the responsibility of
the contractor to safeguard pedestrians and other highway users and their
vehicles from injury or damage due to blasting operations. When the blast area
is within 300 feet of a highway, the blaster shall just prior to the blast
designate a sufficient number of employees of the contractor, each carrying an
approved red warning flag or sign, to stop all vehicular and pedestrian traffic
on each possible route of travel in the vicinity of the blast area until the
blast has been fired. Qualified employees shall be dispatched to predetermined
points on the highways for the purpose of keeping vehicles from entering the
danger zone. A check shall be made of the highways in the danger zone to insure
that there are no parked vehicles or pedestrians who would be endangered by the
blast.
   (62)   Highway Barriers. When the floor of a rock cut is more than five feet
below the average grade of a public highway at any point within 100 feet of
such highway, an effective and approved barrier shall be erected by the
contractor along the property line nearest the highway for an approved distance
to provide protection against the drop or fall of vehicles or persons.
   (63)   Misfired Charges. Immediately following the blast the area shall be
examined by the blaster for evidence of misfired charges. If such is found, he
shall provide proper safeguards for excluding all personnel from the danger
zone, except for minimum personnel who, in the opinion of the blaster, are
required to remove the misfire.
   (64)   Correction of Misfires. All misfires shall be reported at once to the
blaster and inspectors who shall then determine the safe and proper method of
disposal. Each misfire presents an individual problem which shall be placed
under the supervision of a person thoroughly competent to handle such matters.
The unexploded charge shall be detonated if such can be accomplished without
risk of injury to personnel. If repriming is necessary, any stemming present in
the hole may be removed by a jet of water or air. In cases where competent
supervision is not available locally, the explosives manufacturer shall be
consulted as to the availability thereof.
   (65)   Drilling. Drilling in any hole that is known to contain or have
contained explosives is prohibited until satisfactory neutralization is
effected.
   (66)   Record of Misfires. A complete record shall be kept at the
contractors field office showing all misfires, their courses and the method of
disposal.
   (67)   Reloading Bore Holes. In case of a sprung hole or where a charge
fires but does not bring down the burden, it is permissible to reload the bore
hole, if it is in suitable condition to perform its functions, but only after
the temperature of the hole has been reduced by water or otherwise to not more
than 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
   (68)   Stemming of Blast Holes. Each blast hole shall be stemmed to the
collar or to a high enough point to provide efficient confinement of the charge
and to minimize the chance of injury to personnel from flying material.
   (69)   Toe Holes. For toe holes the collar stemming shall in no case be less
than one-third- the depth of the hole.
   (70)   Block Holes. Block holes shall contain at least eighty-five percent
of stemming material.
   (71)   Radio-Frequency Energy. The following requirements shall be complied
with to eliminate the hazards of radio-frequency energy in connection with the
use of electric blasting caps:
      (a)   Irrespective of ownership, mobile transmitting stations with
outputs of up to thirty watts, such as those of the portable type or those
installed in automobiles, shall be kept at least 100 feet away from any
electric blasting cap except when it is in its original container. Users of
such stations shall be notified by the contractor and such users shall comply
with the requirements of this subsection.
      (b)   When such radio transmitters are less than 100 feet away from
electric blasting caps in other than original containers, they will be de-
energized and should be effectively locked.
      (c)   When electric blasting caps are transported in a motor vehicle
equipped with a radio transmitter, they shall either be in their original
package or stored in a closed metal box that is lined with a cushioning
material such as wood or sponge rubber. When the electric blasting caps are
being placed into or removed from the box, the transmitter circuit shall be
disconnected.
      (d)   All blasting operations shall be conducted at no less than the
distances from any fixed or mobile radio transmitter indicated in the following
table:
 
Transmitted Power Output  Minimum Distance From Blasting Operations Using
(in watts)                Electric Blasting

50,001 - 100,000          7,000
 
When it can be demonstrated by means of approved tests that electric blasting
may be carried out at lesser distances from the transmitter than required by
the above table, the Police Chief may allow a variation from the requirements
of such table.
   (72)   Short Period Delay Firing. Short period delay firing shall be used
when necessary to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (73)   Making Up Primers: Containers: Number. Primers shall be made up near
the face, at special benches provided for the purpose. They must be kept in
insulated carriers or containers, separate from other explosives at all times
until placed in bore holes. Primers shall be made up immediately prior to their
use in the blast and the number of such primers shall not be more than is
necessary for such blast.
(O.F. Ord. 1969-16. Passed 6-23-69.)
   (74)    Penalty. Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the
provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.
620.05 RECORDS.
   (a)   Buildings and Structures. When any blasting operation is taking place
within 200 feet of any building or structure, it shall be the responsibility of
the contractor to make a pre- blasting inspection to determine the condition of

custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under 18 years of age
or a child with a mental or physical disability under 21 years of age, shall
create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a
duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,
protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian,
custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical
or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.

when there is a substantial risk that this conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child’s mental health or development.

allow the child to act, model or in any other way participate in, or be

know is obscene, is sexually oriented matter or is nudity-oriented matter.
      (6)   Allow the child to be on the same parcel of real property and
within 100 feet of, or, in the case of more than one housing unit on the same
parcel of real property, in the same housing unit and within 100 feet of, any
act in violation of R.C. § 2925.04 or 2925.041 when the person knows that the

of this division.

misdemeanor of the first degree. If the violation results in serious physical
harm to the child involved, or if the offender previously has been convicted of
an offense under this section, Ohio R.C. 2919.22 or of any offense involving
neglect, abandonment, contributing to the delinquency of or physical abuse of a
child, endangering children is a felony and shall be prosecuted under
appropriate State law.

may sentence the offender for only one of the violations.
      (2)   A.   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (c) hereof but the person is not also convicted of and does not also
plead guilty to a separate charge charging the violation of Section

of subsection (c) hereof, both of the following apply:
            1.   For purposes of the provisions of the Traffic Code penalty
that set forth the penalties and sanctions for a violation of Section
434.01(a) of the Traffic Code, the conviction of or plea of guilty to the

434.01(a) of the Traffic Code, a conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation
of Section
434.01(a) of the Traffic Code.

642.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.15 or
642.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
642.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
642.05 or
642.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being

642.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,

worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to

conditions in culverts. Upon finding any such condition, the Director shall
make a further investigation and finding stating whether the cause of the
obstruction is blockage by foreign material, undersizing of the culvert, the
deteriorated condition thereof or some other cause. If the cause of the
blockage is undersizing of the culvert, the Director shall request the City
Engineer to make a finding as to the proper sizing thereof. Within two weeks
after receiving such request, the City Engineer shall certify to the Director
the proper size of the culvert needed at that particular point in view of the
facts then observable by the City Engineer.

condition, the Director shall cause notice to be given to the owner of the
abutting property stating the existence of the condition, the action required
to correct it and the probable cost of materials thereof. The notice shall
further state that the owner is ordered to correct the deficiency within thirty
days from the date of receipt of the notice or to authorize the City, on a form
provided by the Director, to correct such deficiency.
   (d)   In the event that the owner requests the City to correct the
deficiency, the owner shall be liable only for the cost of materials actually
used and shall deposit with the City the estimated cost of such materials as
stated in the notice at the time at which the request is made for the City to
do the work. Upon completion of the work, the owner will be notified of the

days from its date, or shall receive a refund forthwith of any unused amount of
deposit.

   (e)   In the event that, within thirty days from the date of receipt of
notice by the abutting property owner, the owner has failed to correct the
deficiency and has failed to file a request and deposit with the City for the
correction of the deficiency, the Director is authorized to cause the work to
be done at the expense of the City. He shall keep accurate records of the cost
of materials and labor used in the project which shall become a lien on the
abutting lands. At the completion of the work, the Director shall certify the
total amount of labor and materials involved to Council. Council, shall
forthwith pass an ordinance assessing the total cost thereof plus interest at
the rate of ten percent per year until such amount is paid and a penalty of
fifteen percent of the cost thereof to cover additional expenses to the City
caused by the owner’s failure to abate the nuisance. Upon passage of such
ordinance, the Law Department shall take such action as is necessary to recover
the total amount, either by causing a certification to be made to the County
Auditor in such circumstances as that may be done, by recovery in a court of
competent jurisdiction or by enforcement of the lien.

owned by the City, the Director or the Inspector, upon finding that the
nuisance exists, may cause a written notice or order to be served on the owner
of the real estate. The notice or order shall set forth the nature of the
nuisance, the estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by the City, a
reasonable time determined by the Director or the Inspector within which the
owner shall abate the nuisance or pay the estimated cost to the City, and a
statement that unless the nuisance is so abated or payment made within the
stated time, it may be abated by the City and the cost of abatement assessed on
the real estate involved. Such order shall not preclude the City from
prosecuting the owner for failure to comply with the notice or order within the
stated time.
      (2)   The notice may be served by delivering it personally to the owner,
by leaving it at the owner’s usual place of business or residence, by sending
it by certified mail to the owner’s usual place of business or residence, by
posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved or by publishing
it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City if notice cannot be
served in any other manner provided in this paragraph.
      (3)   If the nuisance is not abated within the time provided, the
Director or the Inspector may cause its abatement and report the cost thereof
to Council, which may assess the same on the real estate on which the nuisance
existed in accordance with Section
1472.02. Only one notice to the property owner, as provided in this subsection,
shall be necessary in any one growing season. The Director or the Inspector may
cause such nuisance to be abated or removed more than once in any growing
season as conditions may require. No property owner who is ordered to abate
such nuisance or to pay the City the estimated cost of abatement shall fail to
comply with such order.
      (4)   When the cause or source of a nuisance exists on property owned by
the City, the Director or the Inspector shall cause the nuisance to be abated
forthwith at the expense of the City. No notice shall be required preliminary
to the abatement.
   (c)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. A violation or noncompliance shall be deemed to exist only
after the final date given for compliance. Thereafter, a separate offense shall
be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
continues. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. (Ord. 23-2011. Passed 4-12-11.)

sidewalk in the right of way of any public street, or on any tree lawn or
driveway, except on the premises from which the snow is removed.
   (b)   No owner, occupant or person in control of the motorized device on the
premises from which snow is so removed shall knowingly cause or allow any
person, by hire or otherwise, to deposit such snow in violation of this
section.
   (c)   This section does not apply to snow placed on another’s premises if
the person depositing the snow has first obtained the consent of the owner of
the premises. Consent of the owner shall be an affirmative defense to the
charge of such violation, and it shall not be incumbent upon the City in any
prosecution of such violation to first prove that no such consent was obtained.
   (d)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.

by the investigative process shall be paid by the property owner.
   (d)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
section is guilty of creating a nuisance, and the abatement process shall be as
follows:

an inspection program for the purpose of discovering and alleviating such
nuisance conditions.
      (2)   Upon determination of the action required to correct the condition,
the Director shall cause a notice to be given to the owner of the abutting
property stating the existence of the condition and the action required to
correct it. The notice shall further state that the owner is ordered to correct
the deficiency within five days from the date of the receipt of the notice, or
to authorize the City, on a form provided by the Director, to correct such
condition. A conditional extension may be granted by the Director.
      (3)   If the owner requests the City to correct the condition, the owner
shall be liable for the cost of the use of City personnel and equipment as
outlined in Chapter
1068. The owner shall file with the City a deposit in the amount of the
Director’s estimated cost of the use of City personnel and equipment at the
time the request for the City to do the work is filed. Upon completion of the
work, the owner will be notified of the actual cost and will receive either a
bill for additional costs not covered by the deposit, which bill shall be
payable within thirty days from its date, or a refund forthwith for any unused
amount on deposit.
      (4)   If, within five days from the date of receipt of the notice by the
abutting property owner, such owner has failed to correct the condition and has
failed to file a request and deposit with the City for the correction of the
condition, the Director is hereby authorized to cause the work to be done at
the expense of the City. He or she shall keep accurate records of the costs of
the project which shall become a lien on the abutting lands. At the completion
of the work, the Director shall certify the total amount of the cost involved
to Council. Council shall forthwith pass an ordinance assessing the total cost
thereof, plus interest at the rate of ten percent per annum until such amount
is paid, and a penalty of fifteen percent of the cost thereof to cover
additional expenses to the City caused by the owner’s failure to abate the
nuisance. Upon passage of such ordinance, the Law Department shall take such
action as is necessary to recover the total amount, either by causing a
certification to be made to the County Auditor, in such circumstances as
authorize the same to be done, by recovery in a court of competent jurisdiction
or by enforcement of the lien.
   (e)   Nothing in this section is intended to supersede the right of the City

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

impose upon the offender a class four suspension of the offender’s probationary
driver’s license, restricted license, driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit or probationary commercial driver’s
license that then is in effect from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4)

state, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the nonresident
operating privilege of the offender from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(4).
      (2)   If the offender shows good cause why the court should not suspend
one of the types of licenses, permits or privileges specified in division (d)
(1) of this section or deny the issuance of one of the temporary instruction
permits specified in division (d)(1) of this section, the court in its
discretion may choose not to impose the suspension, revocation or denial
required in division (d)(1) of this section, but the court, in its discretion,
instead may require the offender to perform community service for a number of
hours determined by the court.
   (e)   As used in this section, “object that is indistinguishable from a
firearm” means an object made, constructed or altered so that, to a reasonable
person without specialized training in firearms, the object appears to be a
firearm.

         (ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (a) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (a) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (a), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (a) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
(ORC 2929.24)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by
division (G) of Section 1547.99, division (B) of Section 4510.14, division (G)
of Section 4511.19 of the Ohio Revised Code, or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code a court that imposes a sentence under this Code upon an offender
for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion to determine the most
efficient way to achieve the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in
Section 2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections 2929.23 to 2929.28 of
the Ohio Revised Code, a court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions
under Sections 2929.24 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code. The court shall not
impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government
resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall determine whether the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense and, to the extent applicable,
shall proceed as follows:
         A.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense, regardless of whether the
offender knew the age of the victim or knew of the victim’s disability, and if
the offense is a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, the court shall
consider that fact in favor of imposing a jail term on the offender, but that
fact shall not control the decision of the court.
         B.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission
of the offense, regardless of whether the offender knew the age of the victim
or knew of the victim’s disability, the court shall consider that fact in favor
of imposing a financial sanction of restitution on the offender under Section
2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code, but that fact shall not control the decision
of the court.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court shall
consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding th offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   The criminal history and character of the offender in general, in
addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and C. of this
section.
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and
C. of this section.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the court
may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under R.C. §§ 2929.25, 2929.26,
2929.27, and 2929.28. A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under
§ 698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or
upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Sections 2743.51 to 2743.72 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
      (3)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.           (ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, division (E) of
Section 2929.14, or division (D) or (E) of Section 2971.03 of the Ohio Revised
Code, a prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment shall be served
concurrently with any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment
imposed by a court of this state, another state, or the United States. Except
as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, a jail term or sentence of
imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or
sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal correctional
institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively, or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Section
2907.322, 2921.34, or 2923.131 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   When consecutive sentences are imposed for misdemeanor under this division,
the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, except
that the aggregate term to be served shall not exceed eighteen months.
      (2)   If a court of this state imposes a prison term upon the offender
for the commission of a felony and a court of another state or the United
States also has imposed a prison term upon the offender for the commission of a
felony, the court of this state may order that the offender serve the prison
term it imposes consecutively to any prison term imposed upon the offender by
the court of another state or the United States.
      (3)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Section 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for
a felony violation of Section 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code or a felony violation of Section 2903.04 of the Ohio Revised Code
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively.
   When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms
are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty
to a violation of a municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to a
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period of time
the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the municipal ordinance shall not exceed the period of suspension
that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the provision
of the Ohio Revised Code to which the municipal ordinance is substantially
similar.

   (a)   There is hereby established the position of Cable Television Community
Programming Coordinator.
   (b)   The duties of the Coordinator include, but are not limited to,
arranging the programming content of the cable television franchisee’s
community programming access channel(s). Such arrangements shall be made in
tandem with the Olmsted Falls City School District and the Township of Olmsted,
through, at such time as either appointments, their counterpart to this
position and any other appropriate entity. There shall be a conscientious
attempt to achieve an optimum balance and timeliness of programming content
among activities of the Administration, issues before Council, recreation and
senior citizen programs and clubs and organizations in the community.
Initially, a new program, approximately thirty minutes in duration, shall be
arranged each month throughout the year, consisting of two or three segments,
followed by a listing of upcoming events, activities and announcements in the
community.
   (c)   The Coordinator shall serve at the pleasure of the Mayor and a
majority of Council and under the technical supervision of the cable television
franchisee and the general supervision of the Olmsted Falls Cable Television
Advisory Board, as provided for by Section 29 of Ordinance 77-79, if
constituted; otherwise, under the supervision of the Community Development
Committee of Council.
   (d)   There shall be no compensation for the Coordinator.
(Ord. 67-84. Passed 5-14-84.)
806.02 REGULATION OF BASIC CABLE TELEVISION RATES.
   The City hereby adopts the rate regulation rules promulgated by the FCC
pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of
1992 (“1992 Cable Act”), 47 C.F.R., Part 76, Subpart N. The determination of
the lawfulness of any cable television rate within the City’s jurisdiction will
be made pursuant to these FCC rules or any successor FCC regulations. All terms
used herein have the same meaning and application as in the FCC’s cable rate
regulation rules. (Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.03 ESTABLISHMENT AND DUTIES OF CABLE REGULATORY STAFF.
   (a)   A cable regulatory staff ("the Staff") for the City will be organized
by the Mayor with the assistance, as desired, of the Cuyahoga County Mayors and
Managers Association, in order to administer the regulation of basic cable
service and equipment rates pursuant to FCC's cable rate regulations and the
1992 Cable Act, with the aid of counsel and other consultants as may be needed.
The Council may at any time delegate additional duties to the Staff.
   (b)   In all instances involving the determination of the lawfulness of a
cable television service rate or rates, the Staff will present to the Council a
recommended decision based on the record. The Council may adopt, amend or
remand for further review a recommended decision of the Staff. The Council may
also direct the Staff at any time to investigate issues pertaining to cable
rate regulation and provide a recommended decision. Any adoption by the Council
of any recommended decision by the Staff regarding the lawfulness of a cable
television service rate or rates shall be considered a final decision. The
Staff shall communicate the results of final decisions to the affected cable
operators in writing.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.04 COMPUTATION OF TIME.
   This section only applies to time periods that need to be computed for
participation in cable rate regulation proceedings administered by the Staff or
the Council.
   (a)   The term "day" shall apply to all days, regardless of holidays.
   (b)   The term "business day" means all days which are not "holidays."
   (c)   If the date for any event specified in these rules falls on a holiday,
the relevant date will be the next business day.
   (d)   The term "holiday" means Saturday, Sunday, officially recognized legal
holidays and any other day on which the Staff offices are not open. For
example, a regularly scheduled Staff business day may become a "holiday" if its
offices are closed for all or part of regular working hours due to adverse
weather or emergency conditions.
   (e)   The first day to be counted in any period of time is the day after the
event which initiates the period. For example, if comments are to be filed
within five days of a public notice issued on November 12, the deadline for
filing the comments would by November 17.
      (Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.05 EFFECTIVE DATE OF RATE REGULATION FOR BASIC SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.910(e)(2) and 76.922, the initial date of
regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which local notice
is given to the cable operator that the provision of the basic service tier is
subject to rate regulation. This local notice will be in the form of a letter
sent by the Staff to the cable operator.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.06 INITIATION OF REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT RATES.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.930(a), a cable operator shall file its schedule of
rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the Staff within
thirty days of receiving written notification from the Staff that the City has
been certified by the FCC to regulate rates for the basic service tier. To
comply with this provision, a cable operator must file a Form 393 regarding
rates that were charged since September 1, 1993, or one year prior to the
commencement of the City's rate regulation, whichever is the shorter period,
and a second Form 393 regarding any proposed rate increases.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)

in a newspaper of general circulation as described in Ohio R.C. 7.12.
   (b)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.935, the Staff shall, within a reasonable
time, but in any case within the twenty-one days after receiving the cable
operator's Form 393 and any related material, issue a public notice stating
that it has received this information.
   (c)   The notice will provide the address of the City or Staff office where
the operator's Form 393 and any related material will be available for public
viewing within specified times. The notice will also provide the address and
telephone number of the cable operator. The cable operator is required to
provide interested parties, upon request, with copies of the Form 393 and any
related materials filed with the Staff.
   (d)   After the Staff issues the public notice described in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this section, interested parties will have five business days to
file written comments with the Staff. There is no prescribed format for these
comments.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.08 STAFF AND COUNCIL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES AND EQUIPMENT COSTS.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933(a), after a cable operator has submitted
for review its existing or past rates for the basic service tier and associated
equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in
the baseline channel change that results from reductions in the number of
channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed
rates will become effective after thirty days from the date of submission,
provided, however, that the Staff may toll this thirty-day deadline for an
additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (b)
hereof within thirty days of the rate submission explaining that it needs
additional time to review the rates.
   (b)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933(b), if the Staff is unable to determine,
based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the past,
existing or proposed rates are within the FCC's permitted basic service tier
charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in 47 C.F.R. 76.922 and 76.923,
or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to 47
C.F.R. 76.937(c) and 76.924, seeking to justify a rate above the FCC's basic
service tier charge as defined in 47 C.F.R. 76.922 and 76.923, then the Staff
may toll the thirty-day deadline set forth in subsection (a) hereof to request
and consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested
parties as follows:
      (1)   For an additional ninety days in cases not involving cost-of-
service showings, for a total of 120 days from the filing by the cable operator
of the Form 393; or
      (2)   For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service
showings, for a total of 180 days from the filing by the cable operator of the
Form 393.
   (c)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933(c), if the Staff has availed itself of
the additional ninety or 150-days permitted under subsection (b) hereof,
whichever is applicable, and has taken no action within these additional time
periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the ninety
or 150-day period, whichever is applicable, or, if no new rates have been
proposed, then the existing rates will remain in effect at such times. All
rates allowed into effect under this subsection will remain subject to refunds
if the Staff subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of
such rates, provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the Staff must
have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the
ninety or 150-day period permitted under subsection (b) hereof, whichever is
applicable, directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were
paid.
   (d)   If the Staff does not seek additional time, the Staff will, within the
thirty-day deadline, submit a recommended decision to the Council about the
reasonableness of the cable operator's rates. If, within the thirty-day period,
the Council does not act upon the Staff's recommended decision, then the
recommended decision will be considered a final decision.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.09 ADDITIONAL TIME FOR REVIEW OF RATES FOR BASIC SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   If the Staff has availed itself of the additional ninety or 150 days
permitted in 47 C.F.R. 76.933(b), whichever is applicable, then the Staff shall
publish a schedule for the issuance of a recommended decision within the
additional time and for the submission of comments by interested parties.
   (b)   Thirty days before the ninetieth day or the 150th day, whichever is
applicable, the Staff shall publish a draft of its recommended decision.
Interested parties will then have five business days to file comments with the
Staff regarding the recommended decision.
   (c)   Upon the expiration of the comment period set forth in subsection (b)
hereof, the record for the cable rate regulation proceeding will close. The
Council will then have an opportunity to review the recommended decision and
any comments or documents filed in the rate proceeding. Nothing in this
subsection prohibits the Council from reviewing the Staff's draft recommended
decision or documents filed with the Staff at any time.
   (d)   If the Council does not act upon the Staff’s recommended decision by
the ninetieth or the 150th day, whichever is applicable, then the recommended
decision will be considered the final decision.
   (e)   Within the ninety or 150-day period, whichever is applicable, the
Council may remand the recommended decision to the Staff for further review
based on the Council's recommendations.
   (f)   If the period for additional review by the Staff extends beyond the
applicable period specified in subsection (a) hereof, then the proposed rates
will go into effect at the end of the ninety or 150-day period, whichever is
applicable, or, if no new rates have been proposed, then the existing rates
will remain in effect at such times. All rates allowed into effect under this
subsection will remain subject to refunds in the event that the Staff
subsequently issues a written decision, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933(c),
disapproving any portion of such rates.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.10 SMALL SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.934, the Council may permit a small system,
as defined in 47 C.F.R. 76.901, to certify that the small system's rates for
basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 C.F.R. 76.922.
   (b)   A system seeking the certification described in subsection (a) hereof
must file a petition to this effect with the Staff.
   (c)   Within a reasonable time of receiving such a petition, the Staff shall
issue a public notice, as described in Section
806.07, stating that it has received such a petition. The notice will provide
the address of the Staff office where the petition will be available for public
viewing within specified times. The notice will also provide the address and
telephone number of the cable operator. The cable operator is required to
provide interested parties with copies of the petition. In addition, the notice
will also provide a date for the presentation of a recommended decision by the
Staff to the Council and shall set a date by which the Council must act upon
the recommended decision, which shall be at least thirty days after the
submission of the Staff's recommended decision. If the Council takes no action
by the date designated by the Staff, then the recommended decision shall be
considered a final decision.
   (d)   After the Staff issues the public notice described in subsection (c)
hereof, interested parties will have five business days to file written
comments with the Staff. There is no prescribed format for these comments.

806.11 WRITTEN DECISION.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.936, the Staff will issue a written decision in a
ratemaking proceeding whenever it or the Council disapproves an initial or past
rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part,
disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or approves a
request for an increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested
parties. In the event that the Council has taken action which constitutes a
final decision of such nature, the written decision will not issue until
approved by Council. The Staff is not required to issue a written decision that
approves an unopposed past, existing or proposed rate for the basic service
tier or associated equipment. The written decision may follow the announcement
of a final decision by a period not to exceed thirty days, unless additional
time is necessary for Council approval as required in this section.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.12 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.938, the Staff may require the production of
proprietary information by the cable operator to make a rate determination and
in such cases the Staff will devise and apply procedures analogous to those set
forth in 47 C.F.R. 0.459 regarding requests for confidentiality. If no request
for confidentiality is made, or if the Staff denies a request for
confidentiality, the information will be made available for public inspection
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43. A cable operator may appeal to the Council a
denial by the Staff of a request for confidentiality. The material which is
subject to the request for confidentiality will not be made available for
public inspection pending a Council decision on the request.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.13 FORFEITURES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.943(a), Council hereby authorizes the Mayor to
impose a civil monetary forfeiture on any cable operator that does not comply
with a rate decision or a refund order directed specifically at the cable
operator. In his or her decision to impose such a forfeiture, the Mayor may
consider the pendency of any appeals or legal action involving the rate
decision or refund order, the amount of the refund or rate reduction, and the
intentional or unintentional nature of the noncompliance. Such forfeitures may
be imposed pursuant to the following schedule:
   (a)   Failure to implement a rate reduction or refund within sixty days of
the date of the communication to the cable operator of the written decision
ordering such rate reduction or refund: $10,000.
   (b)   Failure to implement a rate reduction or refund after sixty days of
the date of the communication to the cable operator of the written decision
ordering such rate reduction or refund: $1,000 per day for each day of
noncompliance.
      (Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.14 BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.937(a), a cable operator has the burden of
proving that its past, existing or proposed rates for basic service and
associated equipment comply with 47 U.S.C. 543 and 47 C.F.R. 76.922 and 76.923.
   (b)   For a past, existing or proposed rate for basic tier service or
associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost
of equipment, as set forth in 47 C.F.R. 76.922 and 76.923, the cable operator
must submit the appropriate FCC form.
   (c)   For a past, existing or proposed rate for basic tier service that
exceeds the permitted tier charge, as set forth in 47 C.F.R. 76.922 and 76.923,
the cable operator must submit a cost-of- service showing to justify the
proposed rate.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.15 NOTIFICATION OF PROPOSED RATE INCREASE.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.932, a cable operator shall provide written notice
to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic
service tier or associated equipment at least thirty days before any proposed

Council and the Staff.
(Ord. 27-94. Passed 2-22-94.)
806.16 CHANGE IN STATUS OF CABLE OPERATOR.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.915, a cable operator may petition the City
for a change in its regulatory status based on a showing of effective
competition. The operator bears the burden of proving the existence of
effective competition.
   (b)   Within a reasonable time of receiving a cable operator's petition for
a change in regulatory status, the Staff shall issue a public notice stating
that the City has received such a petition. The notice will contain a date for
the presentation of a recommended decision by the Staff to the Council. The
notice will also contain the address of the Staff office where the operator's
petition will be available for public viewing within specified times. The
notice will also provide the name and address of the cable operator. The cable
operator is required to provide interested parties with copies of the petition
upon request.
   (c)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.915(a), oppositions to the operator's
petition may be filed with the Staff within fifteen days of public notice of
the filing of the petition, and must be served on the operator. The cable
operator may reply within seven days of filing of oppositions.
   (d)   The initial public notice issued by the Staff will contain a schedule
for the presentation of a recommended decision to the Council. Pursuant to 47
C.F.R. 76.915(b), decisions on petitions for change in status must be made
within thirty days after the pleading cycle set forth in subsections (b) and
(c) hereof closes. The Staff must notify the FCC within ten days of any
decision changing regulatory status. Unless the FCC receives an opposition to
such change in status, the decision will become effective thirty days after
adoption by the Council.
   (e)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.915(c), if there is a final determination by
the Council that effective competition exists, then the Council and the Staff
will cease regulating basic cable service rates. A final determination that
there is no effective competition may be appealed to the FCC pursuant to the
FCC's rules.

   The Building, Housing and Zoning Administrator shall issue a permit to drill
a gas or oil well, or to install tanks, upon receipt of the application and
after a review by the Planning Commission, which permit shall be conditioned on
the following:
   (a)   The applicant shall furnish a surety bond in the sum of two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000), approved by the Law Director, ensuring the
faithful performance of all the laws, rules and regulations of the City, and
further ensuring protection to the City for any damage occurring to the City or
to public property. The bond shall be in force and effect during the entire
operation of the drilling, until such time as the well is capped and for thirty
days thereafter, at which time the applicant may discontinue the bond if he or
she has complied with all conditions thereof. If the applicant chooses to
discontinue his or her bond, as herein provided, he or she must deposit with
the Administrator his or her insurance policies for property damage and
personal injury as specified in Section
836.03(a)(6). Such policies shall not only protect the City as an additional
insured for property damage or injury to third persons, but must also protect
the City for damage to City property or injury to City employees.
   (b)   Prior to any drilling operation, a suitable driveway of 100 feet in
length and capable of supporting fire equipment shall be installed and
maintained as such during the operating life of the well or tank site. When the
driveway crosses an open roadway ditch, a culvert pipe, approved by the
Administrator as to size, material and location, shall be installed to ensure
proper drainage. The spreading of mud and debris upon City streets is
prohibited and the driller shall clean any mud or debris from the streets to
the satisfaction oi the Administrator, the Service Director or the Safety
Director. If it is not completed to the satisfaction of the appropriate
authority, the City shall clean the area and all charges shall be paid by the
permittee.
   (c)   The applicant shall faithfully observe all provisions of law relating
to drilling a gas or oil well.
   (d)   The applicant shall restore all streets, sidewalks, utilities, public
grounds and private grounds, and all places in the City which may be damaged,
to their former condition.
   (e)   The applicant shall clear the area of all litter, machinery, derricks,
buildings, oil or other substances accumulated in the drilling operation.
   (f)   The applicant shall pay any and all damages for property damage or
personal injury arising out of the drilling operation.
   (g)   Fresh water wells located within a radius of one-fourth of a mile
(1,320 feet) of any well shall be tested prior to drilling. Residents may waive
this requirement. Such testing is the responsibility of the permittee, shall be
at the permittee's expense and shall be conducted by a person approved by the
City. Test results shall be filed with the City. If any fresh water well
located within a radius of one-fourth of a mile is disturbed or altered, a new
test will be taken for the presence of deleterious materials, such as
chlorides, sulphates, hydrocarbons and dissolved solids, etc. Such testing is
the responsibility of the permittee, shall be at the permittee's expense and
shall be conducted by a person approved by the City. Test results shall be
filed with the City. If the test shows the fresh water well was not altered by
the well or tanks, the cost of the testing will be paid by the complainant.
         If the fresh water well is proven to have been disturbed by the well
or tanks, the permittee shall immediately correct the problem. Potable water,
in amounts needed by the well user, shall be provided by the permittee, and a
new fresh water well shall be drilled immediately to ensure an adequate potable
fresh water supply to those injured parties. If a new fresh water well is not
drilled within thirty days, the permittee shall suspend his or her operation
and be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day until a new fresh water well
is drilled. The fine shall be in addition to any other penalty provided in this
chapter.
   (h)   No permit shall be issued for the drilling of a well except upon the
ground owned by the applicant, or upon the ground held by the applicant under
an oil and gas lease or drilling contract from the owner, giving permission to
drill the well. Nothing contained in this chapter, nor any permit issued
pursuant to this chapter, shall be deemed to grant any right or license to the
permittee to enter upon or occupy, in any respect, for drilling or production
operations, any land, except by written permission of the owner thereof. Any
permittee entering upon or occupying, in any respect, for drilling or
production operations, any land, without the written permission of the owner
thereof, shall be charged under Section
642.12 (Criminal Trespass) of the General Offenses Code.
      (Ord. 29-83. Passed 3-29-83.)
836.06 TERMINATION OF PERMIT.
   When a permit is issued pursuant to this chapter, the same shall terminate
and become inoperative, without any action on the part of the City, unless,
within six months from the date of issuance, actual drilling of the well has
commenced. The cessation of the drilling operation for six months shall operate
to terminate and cancel the permit, and the well shall be deemed abandoned.
Thereafter, no person shall drill or operate any such well within the City
without the issuance of another permit.
(Ord. 29-83. Passed 3-29-83.)
836.07 LIMITATIONS ON LOCATION.
   No person shall act or use any drilling rig or storage tank, or build any
related structure, nearer than 500 feet from any inhabited private dwelling
house, without first obtaining written consent from the private property owner;
or nearer than 500 feet from any public building which may be used as a place
of resort, assembly, education, entertainment, lodging, trade, manufacture,
repair, storage, traffic or occupancy by the public, without first obtaining,
in writing, the consent of all the owners of public buildings within that
radius as measured from the center of the proposed well. No person shall act or
use any drilling rig or storage tank nearer than 500 feet from any private
water supply, or nearer than 500 feet from any other gas or oil well. However,
where a unique or unusual condition exists, and undue hardship will result by
compliance with these requirements, Council may, at its discretion, amend the
distance requirements.
(Ord. 29-83. Passed 3-29-83.)
836.08 MODIFICATION OF EXISTING WELLS; REMOVAL OF DEBRIS.
   (a)   No person shall extend, deepen or enlarge any existing gas or oil well
without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Building, Housing and Zoning

(W.V. Ord. 446. Passed 8-25-47.)
870.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until it
is paid to the Finance Director as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed by this chapter who fails to collect the same or,
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Director in the
manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his
own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place
and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Director in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the
tenth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which
the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected
may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the
Director, but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax
from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Director unless the
check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person receiving
any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms and set
forth such information as the Director may require, showing the amount of the
tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director with a remittance for such
amount. However, the Director may, at his discretion, require verified annual
returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such
additional information as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show,
exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is
subject to the tax herein levied, and the same is of a temporary or transitory
nature, of which the Director shall be the judge, the Director may require the
report and remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of
the same, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the
conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such other times
as the Director determines. Failure to comply with any requirement of the
Director as to report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a
violation of this chapter. The books, records and accounts of any person
collecting the tax herein levied shall, as to admission charges and tax
collections, be at all reasonable times subject to examination and audit by the
Director. If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall
be added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month
from the time the tax became due until paid.
(W.V. Ord. 446. Passed 8-25-47.)
870.05 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Finance Director,
make application to and procure from the Director a Certificate of
Registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00), which Certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued.
Such Certificate, or duplicate original copies thereof, to be issued by the
Director without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(W.V. Ord. 446. Passed 8-25-47.)
870.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
870.04 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the amusement. The applicant for a Certificate for such purpose shall furnish
with the application therefor the name and address of the owner, lessee or
custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted, and such
owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Finance Director of the
issuance of such Certificate and the joint liability for collection and
remittance of such tax.
(W.V. Ord. 446. Passed 8-25-47.)
870.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Finance Director shall have power to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied, and a copy of
such rules and regulations shall be published by posting the same in the manner
provided by Section
5.06 of the City Charter for the posting of ordinances and resolutions. Failure
or refusal to comply with any of such rules and regulations shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.

880.03 LEVY OF TAX.
   An annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
880.01 shall be imposed on and after March 1, 1982, at the rate of one and one-
half percent per year, upon the following:
   (a)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on
and after March 1, 1982, by residents of the City;
      (Ord. 31-96. Passed 6-11-96.)
   (b)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on
and after March 1, 1982, by nonresidents of the City for work done or services
performed or rendered in the City. A nonresident individual who works in the
City twelve (12) or fewer days per year shall be considered an occasional
entrant, and shall not be subject to the City’s municipal income tax for those
twelve days. For purposes of the twelve-day calculation, any portion of a day
worked in the City shall be counted as one day worked in the City. Beginning
with the thirteenth day, the employer of said individual shall begin
withholding the City’s income tax from remuneration paid by the employer to the
individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the City in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter. Since the individual can no longer be
considered to have an occasional entrant, the employer is further required to
remit taxes on income earned in the City by the individual for the first twelve
days. If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the responsibility of the
individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the City. The twelve-day
occasional entrant rule does not apply to entertainers or professional
athletes, their employees or individuals who perform services on their behalf,
or to promoters and booking agents of such entertainment events and sporting
events. (Ord. 83-2004. Passed 12-28-04.)
   (c)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned on
and after March 1, 1982, of all resident unincorporated business entities or
professions or other activities derived from sales made, work done, services
performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in the City;
   (d)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned on
and after March 1, 1982, of a resident partner or owner of a resident
unincorporated business entity not attributable to the City and not levied
against such unincorporated business entity by the City;
   (e)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned on
or after March 1, 1982, of all nonresident unincorporated business entities,
professions or other activities derived from sales made, work done, services
performed or rendered and business and other activities conducted in the City,
whether or not such unincorporated business entity has an office or place of
business in the City;
   (f)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned on
or after March 1, 1982, of a resident partner or owners of a nonresident
unincorporated business entity not attributable to the City and not levied
against such unincorporated business entity by the City;
   (g)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned on
and after March 1, 1982, of all corporations, derived from sales made, work
done, services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted
in the City, whether or not such corporations have an office or place of
business in the City; and
   (h)   On the portion attributable to the City pursuant to this chapter,
including:
      (1)   Royalty income, which is income earned by a taxpayer from a royalty
interest in the production of an oil or gas well, whether managed, extracted or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through an agent or other
representative, and which shall be included in the computation of net profits
from a business activity to the extent that such royalty interest constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer. Where the gross income received by a
taxpayer from a royalty interest in the production of an oil or gas well in a
taxable year, exceeds three thousand dollars ($3,000), it shall be prima- facie
evidence that the income was derived from a business activity of such taxpayer
and the net income from such royalty interest shall be subject to the tax.
      (2)   The employer’s income derived from finance and carrying charges
associated with its consumers’ accounts receivable.
   (i)   On all winnings from lotteries, gaming, wagering or other schemes of
chance by residents of the City on and after July 1, 1996.
      (Ord. 31-96. Passed 6-11-96.)
880.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax provided for in this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid
with respect to the salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation, and
with respect to the net profits of businesses, professions or other activities,
earned on and after January 1, 1969.
(W. V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.05 ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination. The portion of the entire net profits of a
taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within and without the
boundaries of the City to be allocated as having been derived from within the
City, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. For the purpose of this
paragraph, real property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer and
the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental
price thereof by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever those
services are performed; and
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period for sales made and services
performed, wherever so made or performed.
   (b)   Alternate Methods. Should the above allocation formula produce an
inequitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations promulgated by
the Administrator, be substituted so as to produce such result.
   If the Administrator approves the use of books and records as a substitute
method, the following shall apply:
      (1)   The net profits allocable to the City from business, professional
or other activities conducted in the City by corporations or unincorporated
entities (whether resident or nonresident) may be determined from the records
of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that
part of his activities conducted within the City.
      (2)   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining the
manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the
Administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the City are
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
      (3)   In determining the income allocable to the City from the books and
records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution made to
the production of such income by headquarters activities of the taxpayer,
whether such headquarters is within or without the City.
         (Ord. 83-2004. Passed 12-28-04.)
880.06 DEFINITION OF “SALES MADE IN THE CITY.”
   As used in Section
880.05(a)(3), the term “sales made in the City” means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a stock of
goods within the City;
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a point
outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion, but mere advertisements in
published media shall not be deemed to be such solicitation or promotion as
falls within the purview of this subsection;
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title
passes, if the taxpayer is not, through his own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made, as
the term solicitation or promotion is used in subsection (b) hereof.
      (W.V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.07 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
880.05 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the particular
taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the number of percentages used in
deriving such total in order to obtain the percentage business allocation
referred to in Section
880.05. A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside of the City.
(W.V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.08 RENTAL INCOME .
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under Section
880.03(c) to (g), only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are
derived, whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or
through agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity in
whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima- facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to the
tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month. In the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged
in a business activity when he shares in crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not
such gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, and
the same shall be true of greenhouse property. The person who operates a
licensed rooming house shall be considered in the business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   Property owners who are considered to have a business activity under the
provisions of this section shall submit or cause to be submitted to the
Administrator a list of names, addresses and tax identification numbers of all
persons, firms, corporations or other entities occupying, leasing or renting
any premises belonging to the property owner within the Municipality. The
required list shall be prepared as of December 31 of each year and submitted on
or before January 31 of the following year. In addition to the annual filing
requirement stated herein, any changes to the information contained in the list
as filed with the Administrator shall be reported by way of a supplemental
filing within thirty days after such change occurs.
(Ord. 85-94. Passed 7-14-94.)
880.09 OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained subsequent to January 1,
1969, in any taxable year, if allocable to the City, may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the City until
exhausted, but in no event for more than five years immediately following the
taxable year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss
shall be carried back against the net profits of any prior year.
   (b)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
   (c)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner in
which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
(W.V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.10 EXEMPTIONS; SOURCES OF INCOME NOT TAXED .
   The tax provided by this chapter shall not be levied on the following:
   (a)   The pay or allowance of active members of the Armed Forces of the

the operation of a business);
   (j)   Salaries, wages, commission and other compensation and net profits,
the taxation of which is prohibited by the Constitution of the United States or
any act of Congress limiting the power of states or their political
subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from interstate
commerce; or

04.)

   Each taxpayer, except as provided in this section, shall, whether or not a
tax is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 30 of each year

end of such fiscal year or period. Any person who has no income need not file
an annual return. Any person who has exempt income must file a return and

the request of the taxpayer for a period not to exceed six months, or one month
beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service
for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return. The Administrator may require
a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due
thereon, by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or interest shall
be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.
   The extension request may be made by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s request
for a federal filing extension, or by filing a written request. The
Administrator may deny the extension if the taxpayer’s income tax account with

(W. V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68; Ord. 83-2004. Passed 12-28-04.)

accordance with rules and regulations permitted and prescribed by the
Administrator.
   (b)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City,
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Administrator
finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.
(W. V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
   (c)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the City. However, once the affiliated group
has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return with the City,
the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in any subsequent
tax year without written approval from the City.

880.15 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
880.31 to
880.35, inclusive. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request
from the Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended return showing income subject to the City tax based upon
such final determination of Federal tax liability and pay any additional amount
of tax due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(W. V. Ord. 1968-42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.16 PAYMENT OF TAX ON FILING RETURN.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon. However, where
any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to
Section
880.17, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to Section
880.18, or where an income tax has been paid on the same income to another
Municipality, credit for the amount so deducted or paid, or credit to the
extent provided for in Section
880.34, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable, at the time of filing the return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which this City is
entitled under this chapter may have such overpayment applied against any
subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election, indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (c)   If an employer who is liable for tax obligations imposed by this
chapter undergoes a fundamental change, then the employer and its manager shall
be liable for taxes due up to the date of the fundamental change. Taxes and
final tax returns shall be due immediately after the fundamental change. Any
successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the successor
owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes, interest
and penalty which the predecessor employer owes pursuant to this chapter. The
successor employer shall make such withholding until such time that the
predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and penalties. If the
successor fails to withhold such amounts, then the successor and, in a personal
manner, the successor’s manager, shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of such taxes, interest and penalty.
(Ord. 104-84. Passed 9-25-84.)
880.17 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the City, shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of a salary, wage, commission or other
compensation, the tax of one and one-half percent per year of the gross salary,
wages, commission or other compensation due by that employer to the employee,
and shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return and pay to
the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month.
However, if the amount of the tax so deducted by an employer in any one month
is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the employer may defer the filing
of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the month
following the end of the calendar quarter in which such month occurred.
   (b)   Returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the
Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefore by the Administrator. The employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has, in
fact, been withheld.
   (c)   The employer, in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the City as a trustee for the benefit
of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or her
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person’s residence, even though such residence is in the City, but
such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Every manager’s obligations shall be as follows:
      (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of the City in collecting
and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and the funds
so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Every manager is
liable directly to the City for payment of such trust, whether or not actually
collected by the employer. Any tax deducted and withheld shall be considered
paid to the City, whether or not the employer actually remits the tax to the
City, for purposes of determining employee payments or credits.
      (2)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer’s
return or to pay the employer’s tax interest and penalty as required by this
chapter.
      (3)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees’ or manager’s
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon if any. However, if a person’s income is wholly from
wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the City in
accordance with Section
880.17, such person need not file a declaration. If the estimated tax for the
current year, less the tax to be withheld and less the tax credit allowed in
Sections
880.34 and
880.35 amounts to not more than ten dollars ($10.00), no declaration or payment
of estimated tax is required.

880.34 and
880.35 credit may be taken for tax to be paid or to be withheld and remitted to
another taxing municipality.
   (b)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be increased

      (Ord. 26-2004. Passed 5-11-04.)
880.26 EXCEPTIONS.
   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made by the
Administrator against a taxpayer when a return has been filed in good faith and
the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator. In the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after a
final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   No penalties or interest shall be assessed on estimated payments if the
taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to one hundred percent of the previous
year’s tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a twelve-month

declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making any
information return, return or declaration, nor from filing such form, nor from

(W.V. Ord. 1968 42. Passed 10-22-68.)
880.31 COLLECTION PROCEDURES; UNPAID TAXES TREATED AS OTHER DEBTS.
   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with any
interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount would be
recoverable at law. Except in the case of fraud, of omission of a substantial
portion of income subject to this chapter and tax, or of failure to file a
return, additional assessment shall not be made after three years from the time
the return was due or filed, whichever is later. However, in those cases in
which a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a

dollar and fifty-one cents (51¢) being calculated as the next higher even
dollar.

880.34 RESIDENT SUBJECT TO TAX ELSEWHERE.

to the municipal income tax of another municipality, or of a joint economic
development district created pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.70, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, on the same income taxable under this chapter,
such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income tax paid on
such taxable income to such other municipality or joint economic development
district equal to one-third of this Municipality's tax rate. As used in this
section, "taxable income" includes the distributive share of net profits of a
resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business entity.
   (b)   If a City resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid in another
municipality or joint economic development district, such resident is required
to file a return on such forms and in such manner as the Administrator may
prescribe. If such resident fails, neglects or refuses to file such return or

such credit and shall be considered to be in violation of this chapter for
failure to file a return and make payment of taxes when due hereunder.

   Any claim for credit for income taxes paid to another municipality or to a
joint economic development district created pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.70, as
the same exists or may be hereafter amended, on the same income taxable
hereunder, or claim for or assignment of any refund due to the credit provided
for herein, must be filed with the Administrator on or before December 31 of
the year following that for which such credit is claimed. However, when such
claim for reciprocity refund is assigned to the municipality of residence, such
municipality of residence shall file a claim for refund with the Administrator
of the City on or before January 31 following. Failure to file such claim for
reciprocity credit or refund, or assignment thereof, within the time prescribed
herein shall render such credit, claim for refund or assignment null and void.

   (b)   Execution of Return. If any taxpayer fails to file a tax return which
is required by this chapter within the time prescribed therefor, or makes,
willfully or otherwise, a false or fraudulent return, then the Administrator
shall make in a reasonable manner such return from his or her own knowledge and
from such information as he or she can obtain through testimony or otherwise.

whenever the Administrator has knowledge derived from any source, including the
taxpayer's financial data that any executed tax return or assessment is
imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.

   (A)   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)   The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)   As used in this chapter:
      (1)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as

corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this section, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)   Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)   Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply to the

carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         (i)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section

respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,

Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City of Olmsted Falls shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of Olmsted
Falls. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
881.03 or (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at the rate,
specified in Section
881.01 of this chapter, of 1.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in (B)(2) of this section, an employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of the City
of Olmsted Falls the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the
income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City of Olmsted Falls in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Olmsted Falls in any month of
the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the payment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of
each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Olmsted Falls. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
section shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Olmsted Falls as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Olmsted Falls income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City of Olmsted Falls the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Olmsted Falls income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Olmsted Falls until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Olmsted Falls during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of Olmsted
Falls income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this section,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this section shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this section, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with (C)(2)(b) of this

employer is not required to withhold the City of Olmsted Falls income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City of Olmsted Falls if the employee performed such services in the
City of Olmsted Falls on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City

worksite locations in the City of Olmsted Falls. For the purposes of this

temporary worksite in the City of Olmsted Falls at which the employer provides
or provided services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by
the employer to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can
"reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of
the following applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;

has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying
wages as provided in Section
881.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of (C)(2)(a) of this section, an employee shall
be considered to have spent a day performing services in the City of Olmsted
Falls only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City of Olmsted Falls than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in (C)(2)(a) of this section shall apply
only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that
section, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in (C)(4)(b) of this section, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in the City of Olmsted Falls exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Olmsted Falls for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Olmsted
Falls.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Olmsted Falls under (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
City of Olmsted Falls for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Olmsted Falls.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City of Olmsted Falls and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
881.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Olmsted Falls, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Olmsted Falls.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Subsections (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Olmsted Falls' income
tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the

the filing of the City of Olmsted Falls' income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except

circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This section shall not

of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.

the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Olmsted Falls,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Olmsted Falls or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the City of Olmsted Falls' ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of
Olmsted Falls for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the City of Olmsted Falls
during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this section are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City of Olmsted Falls before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
chapter are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

section the application of subsections (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of Olmsted Falls in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under (P)(2)
(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Olmsted Falls' income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning

file a consolidated City of Olmsted Falls income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Olmsted Falls. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated City of Olmsted Falls income tax return for a

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Olmsted Falls
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in subsections (R) through (Y) of
Section
881.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the

entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Olmsted Falls. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the

income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in subsections (R) through (Y) of
Section
881.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Olmsted Falls;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to City of Olmsted
Falls income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on
the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated City of Olmsted Falls income tax
return shall make the computations required under subsections (R) through (Y)
of Section
881.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.

refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered

reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
881.18 (A)(4).

federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
881.09.

a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This section does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 53-2015. Passed 12-22-15.)
881.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment shall be
served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Olmsted Falls
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under (C)(1)(a) of this section. A
person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under this section
in accordance with (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
(C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
       (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to collection and
is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60 days after the
initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of Olmsted Falls
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this section
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under (C)
(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been delivered for
collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 53-2015. Passed 12-22-15.)
881.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Olmsted Falls that arises pursuant to the City of Olmsted Falls'
income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter/ordinance.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Olmsted Falls:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 53-2015. Passed 12-22-15.)
881.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Olmsted Falls as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the City of Olmsted Falls from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 53-2015. Passed 12-22-15.)
881.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Olmsted Falls
ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with intent to defraud the City of Olmsted Falls or
the Tax Administrator.

         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required

2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City of Olmsted Falls to which the return is to be filed or the payment is

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by

such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

881.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
881.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

881.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

issued shall, at his own expense, install and maintain such signs, warning
devices, lights, barricades, drums, cones or flagmen, as shown on the traffic

ultimately to the City's formal acceptance of the dedication of a specific
right of way and to the furnishing of complete City services to the properties
abutting thereto.
   (a)   A majority of the owners of property abutting a given right of way
desirous of the City's acceptance of the dedication or improvement of the
condition thereof may prepare and submit to Council a petition setting forth
such desire and stipulating the roadway classification desired. If requested,
the Law Director shall suggest a form and wording for such petition.
   (b)   Council, reacting to such petition of abutting property owners
requesting the acceptance of the dedication of a specific right of way may
direct the City Engineer to proceed with a thorough examination of documents
applying thereto along with an on-site inspection of such right of way and
submit a report to Council in writing within thirty days after the issuance of
such direction. Council shall, immediately after issuance of such direction,
cause notice to be given to all affected property owners of the commencement of
such study and the procedure set forth in this chapter.
   (c)   The report so directed shall recommend confirmation or revision of the
right of way and roadway classes tentatively fixed hereby, shall fix the
presence or lack of all right-of-way improvements and shall present a
preliminary estimate of the cost of the improvements required to produce a
right of way consistent with the applicable petition and according to the
provisions hereof along with a recommended distribution of the cost thereof.
   (d)   Council may, by motion, establish the involved classifications and
improvements thereto by accepting the findings of the City Engineer or by
modifying his findings. Council shall have the further right to resubmit the
matter to the City Engineer or to any committee of Council or such other body
or official as Council deems desirable for the purpose of making further
findings. In such case, Council shall establish time limits for the
resubmission of the report to Council for further action.
   (e)   Upon Council's acceptance of the findings and recommendations of the
report covered in subsections (c) and (d) hereof, all affected property owners
will be advised of the result thereof and Council shall decide that further
activity pursuant to final acceptance of the involved right-of-way dedication
shall, or shall not, proceed.
   (f)   Upon Council's decision that further activity shall proceed, all
affected property owners shall be notified and the Law Director and City
Engineer shall be directed to proceed with the preparation of documentation
leading to the eventual dedication acceptance of the involved right of way.
   (g)   Upon Council's decision that further activity shall not proceed, all
affected property owners shall be notified and such decision, along with the
reasoning applying thereto, shall be recorded in the written record of Council
proceedings.
   (h)   Nothing herein is intended to preclude the right of the City to accept
for dedication to public use the rights of way of the City without petition of
abutting property owners requesting such dedication acceptance. Council may, in
an effort to protect the health, safety and welfare of all community residents,
force such dedication acceptance along with the assessment of costs accruing
thereto, and in this case the foregoing procedure shall also apply to the
extent that it is not inconsistent with this subsection. (Res. 18-74. Passed 2-
26-74.)
1022.06 ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
   In determining the cost of improving or maintaining a right of way, the
following procedure shall be followed:
   (a)   In the event that the acceptance of the dedication of the right of way
involved includes the construction of improvements therein, the City shall
exclude from any assessment not 1ess than two percent of the total cost of the
project, plus the cost of intersections. In the event that the involved right
of way classification is finally determined to be (a) Arterial or (b)
Collector, then the City's participation shall be increased to compensate for
this factor. The specific percentage of such City participation shall be fixed,
prior to actual improvement construction, by Section
1022.05.
   (b)   After the completion of the procedure included in subsection (a)
hereof and the construction of the improvements resulting therefrom, the entire
cost of routine maintenance of the involved right of way is intended to be
borne by the City.
   (c)   In the event that the acceptance of the dedication of the right of way
involved does not include the construction of improvements therein and the
maintenance thereof is the total extent of the City's involvement therein, then
the entire cost of routine maintenance is intended to be borne by the City.
   (d)   Specific point is made of the fact that the City maintenance referred
to in subsections (b) and (c) hereof contemplates the maintenance of the right
of way improvements in the same quality and to the same extent as is existing
at the time of the acceptance of the dedication of the involved right of way.
      (Res. 18-74. Passed 2-26-74.)
   
1022.07 ACCEPTANCE; COMPLIANCE WITH PAVING SPECIFICATIONS; BOND.
   Prior to acceptance of any right of way in the City for dedication by
Council, the person requesting such acceptance and dedication shall comply or
cause compliance with the paving specifications established by the City
Engineer for such projects in conformity with the Subdivision Regulations
(Ordinance 47-73, passed October 23, 1973) or such other standards established
by Council and shall give or cause to be given a maintenance bond in favor of
the City as required by the Subdivision Regulations unless Council waives or
modifies this requirement.
1022.08 REMEDIAL MAINTENANCE.
   With regard to any right of way accepted for dedication pursuant to Section
1022.07, if remedial maintenance is, in the judgment of the City Engineer,
approved by simple motion in Council, necessary for the health and safety of
those persons using the right of way, then the City Engineer shall direct the
guarantor, in writing by certified mail, to repair the defects or to replace
the section of right of way in question within thirty days. If such remedial
action is not taken, the City Engineer shall notify Council of such failure at
which time Council may order repairs by some other party, for which the
guarantor shall be liable in full.

      (3)   Upon receipt of an application by a Service Provider for approval
to occupy or use the Public Right-of-Way, the City shall forthwith refer the
application to its Police Department for review and determination of the impact
of the proposed Facilities or System on the pedestrian and traffic safety, and
schedule a hearing on the Service Provider's application for approval on the
agenda of the Planning & Zoning Commission, so that the matter is heard within
forty-five (45) days of the date on which the application was filed with the
City.
      (4)   Within fifteen (15) days of said hearing the Planning & Zoning
Commission shall issue its findings and report as follows:
         A.   To determine compliance of this code section by the Service
Provider through its application to occupy or use the Public Right- of-Way
based on whether the Service Provider possesses the financial, technical and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, or based upon the report of the Police Department concerning
pedestrian or safety factors, for other reasons based on the health, safety and
welfare of the City and in accordance with Ohio law or applicable regulation.
                     1.    If the Planning & Zoning Commission determines non-
compliance by a Service Provider in its application to occupy or use the Public
Right-of-Way, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall provide its reasons in
writing for its determination of non- compliance, and shall identify any
additional information necessary in order for the Service Provider to
demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this code section and to occupy
or use the Public Right-of-Way.
         B.   If the Planning & Zoning Commission determines compliance of the
provisions of this code section through the application of a Service Provider
to occupy or use the Public Right-of-Way, the City shall provide the Service
Provider with a Right-of-Way occupancy permit which shall set forth the
specific terms and conditions of its occupancy and use.
      (5)   Each Service Provider submitting an application for approval to
occupy or use the Public Right-of-Way shall pay a fee to reimburse the City for
its actual administrative costs related to the application as provided in
Section
1032.07. A Service Provider may exercise its right of review of such fee as
provided by PUCO regulation.
   (b)   Application to Existing Franchise Ordinances, Agreements, or Operation
Under a PUCO Tariff.  For purposes of this Chapter, any Service Provider who
operates under either a franchise ordinance, written agreement, or PUCO tariff,
shall be deemed to be in compliance with a Service Provider's occupancy or use
of the Public Right-of-Way to the extent described in the agreement, franchise
ordinance, or PUCO tariff. The Service Provider's use of the Public Right- of-
Way beyond that authorized by the agreement, franchise ordinance, or PUCO
tariff shall require compliance under this section for such additional
occupancy or use. Service Providers shall comply with the registration
provisions and construction standards to the extent that the provisions of this
Chapter do not directly conflict with the agreement, franchise ordinance, or
PUCO tariff. If there is a direct conflict between an agreement, franchise
ordinance, or PUCO tariff in effect prior to the adoption of the provisions of
this Chapter, the agreement, franchise ordinance, or PUCO tariff shall control.
   
   (c)    Service Provider Insurance. As a condition of the approval to occupy
or use the Public Right-of-Way, a Service Provider must secure and maintain, at
a minimum, the following liability insurance policies insuring both the Service
Provider and the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, employees and representatives as additional insureds:
      (1)   Comprehensive general liability insurance with limits not less than
         A.   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each Person;
         B.   Five million dollars ($ 5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         C.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability.
      (2)   The liability insurance policies required by this Section shall be
maintained by the Service Provider throughout the period of time during which
the Service Provider is occupying or using the Public Right-of-Way, or is
engaged in the removal of its Facilities, with proof thereof furnished to the
City. Each such insurance policy shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after receipt by
the City, by registered mail, of a written notice addressed to the City of such
intent to cancel or not to renew."
      (3)   Within sixty (60) days after receipt by the City of said notice,
and in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to said cancellation, the
Service Provider shall obtain and furnish to the City replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this Section.
      (4)   Upon written application to, and written approval by, the City, a
Service Provider may be self-insured to provide all of the same coverages as
listed in this Section; however, a public utility subject to jurisdiction of
the PUCO and operating under its tariff that has established a self-insurance
fund that complies with the laws and regulations of the State of Ohio shall
satisfy this requirement by simply providing information to the City relating
to such self-insurance fund and the appropriate contact point for matters
relating to that fund.
  
   (d)    General Indemnification. Each application for approval to occupy or
use the Public Right-of-Way, and each annual registration, shall include, to
the extent permitted by law, the Service Provider's express undertaking to
defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors harmless from
and against third party claims (including all damages, losses and expenses,
including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense), arising out
of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent,
careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the
Service Provider or its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors (for the construction, installation, operation, maintenance,
repair or removal of its System or Facilities, and in providing or offering
Services over the Facilities or System), whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or in accordance with federal
and/or state regulation. (Ord. 49-2018. Passed 7-24-18.)

         (ORd. 49-2018. Passed 7-24-18.)
1032.04 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities.  All Facilities shall be constructed,

underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such
Facility.
      (2)   A Service Provider with permission to install Overhead Facilities
shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles
only, and then only if surplus space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a Service
Provider with permission to occupy the same Public Right-of-Way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities, must also
locate its Facilities underground to the extent technologically feasible.
      (4)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the City.
   
   (b)   Above Ground Facility Location Protocol.
      (1)    Any Facility located or to be located above, including any doors,
shall maintain an unobstructed sidewalk width of five (5) feet to provide for
unimpeded pedestrian and wheelchair passage, except where the existing sidewalk
width is less than six (6) feet, and a minimum of two (2) feet unobstructed
distance from the perimeter of the above ground Facility to the roadway curb
face and to the closest edge of the public sidewalk.
      (2)   No above ground Facility shall create a safety hazard by being
installed:

         H.   Immediately in front of buildings, houses, structures, or public
stairs such that it causes a violation of ADA guidelines for pedestrian passage
between private property and the Public Rights- of-Way.
   (c)   Excess Capacity. To reduce excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the City's goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way.
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and such construction is in an area
in which other Service Providers would likely construct Facilities in the
future, the City may request the Service Provider to construct the conduit in
the Public Right-of-Way with excess capacity in the Public Right-of-Way,
subject to existing contracts and/or legal requirements concerning existing
third party Service Providers.
   
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following

determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary, or warranted as follows:

City or other public improvement in or upon the Public Right-of-Way.

be in accordance with state law and regulations of the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio.

1032.07 RECOVERY OF CITY COSTS IN MANAGING THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (a)   Purpose.  It is the purpose of this Section
1032.07 to provide for the recovery of all direct and indirect costs and
expenses actually incurred by the City and associated with a Public or Private
Service Provider's occupancy or use of the Public Right-of-Way and related to
the enforcement and administration of this Chapter. All fees related to the
occupancy or use of the Public Right-of-Way shall be assessed in a manner to be
determined by the City.
   (b)   Fee Determination Criteria.  The fee shall be based only on costs that
the City both has actually incurred and can clearly demonstrate are or can be
properly allocated and assigned to the occupancy or use of the Public Right-of-
Way. Such costs shall be reasonably and competitively neutrally allocated among
all Service Providers occupying or using the Public Right- of-Way owned or
controlled by the City. Consistent with Ohio R.C. 4939.06, if a Service
Provider does not accept a fee levied against it, the Service Provider may
appeal the fee to the PUCO within thirty (30) days after the fee is actually
assessed.
   (c)   Regulatory Fees and Compensation Not a Tax.  The regulatory fees and
costs provided for in this Chapter are separate from, and additional to, any
and all federal, state, local and City taxes as may be levied, imposed or due

installed in association with a small cell facility, the following materials
and information must be provided:
      (1)   Non-Residential Right-of-Way Permit application and fee as
specified in these Supplemental provisions.
         (Ord. 49-2018. Passed 7-24-18.)
1032.15 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS
   (A)   Permit Application Review Timeframes.
      (1)   Eligible Facilities Request (Type I). The City shall process
Eligible Facilities Requests in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, 47
C.F.R. 1.40001, and Sections 913.11 through 913.20 herein not later than sixty
(60) days after the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)   Collocation with Substantial Modifications (Type II). The City
shall grant or deny its consent for requests to collocate, or to replace or
modify a small cell facility on an existing wireless support structure where
substantial modifications are required to the wireless support structure not
later than ninety (90) days after the date of filing by a person of a completed
application.
      (3)   New Wireless Support Structure (Type III).  The City shall grant or
deny its consent for requests to construct, modify, or replace a wireless
support structure associated with a small cell facility not later than one
hundred twenty (120) days following the date of filing of a complete
application by an entity.
      (4)   Wireless Support Structure Removal (Type IV). The City shall grant
or deny its consent for requests to remove wireless support structures
associated with small cell facilities from the right-of-way typical to the
review timeframes for the Non-Residential Right-of-Way Permit required for this
activity.
   (B)   Failure to Grant or Deny Within Prescribed Timeframes. If the City
fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section or a request
for a relevant work permit within the required time period, provided the time
period is not tolled under sub-section (D) below, the request shall be deemed
granted upon the requesting entity providing notice to the City that the time
period for acting on the request has lapsed.
   (C)   Application Denials.
      (1)   The City shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent for small
cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-way.
      (2)   If a request for consent is denied, the City shall provide in
writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)   Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the City,
for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any person
based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   
   (D)   Tolling of Required Timeframes.  
      (1)   The time periods required in this Section may be tolled only:
         (a)   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and
the City;
         (b)   In cases where the City determines that the application is
incomplete; or
         (c)   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth in this Section due to
the lack of resources of the City, then the City may toll the time limits as
follows:
            (i)   As a community population of 30,000 or less individuals, the
time period may be tolled for up to twenty-one days for fifteen or more small
cell facility or wireless support structure requests received by the City
within any consecutive thirty-day period.
            (ii)   Further, for every additional fifteen requests that the City
receives above the thresholds provided above the City may toll the time period
for those requests for up to fifteen days in addition to the time period
provided in division (1)(c)(1) of this section.
            (iii)   In no instance shall the City toll the time period for any
small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than ninety
consecutive days. Upon request, the City shall provide an owner or operator
written notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless support
structure request.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the City shall provide
written notice to the person requesting consent not later than thirty days
after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all missing
documents or information. The missing documents or information shall be
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described
herein and in accordance with state and federal law or documentation intended
to illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for
the request, does not toll the time period.
      (3)   The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of
incompleteness.
      (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the City shall notify
the entity not later than ten days after receiving the supplemental submission
that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in
the original notice delineating missing documents or information. The time
period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices under the
procedures identified in divisions (1) to (3) of this section. Second or
subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or
information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
   (E)   Timeframe for Completion of Permit.
      (1)   Permits granted for an Eligible Facilities Requests, Collocations
with Substantial Modifications and New Wireless Support Structures shall be
completed by the owner or operator or its agent within one hundred eighty days
after issuance of the permit, unless:
         (a)   The City and the owner or operator agree to extend this period;
or
         (b)   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a City-owned wireless
support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial power or
backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            (i)   The owner or operator has made a timely request within sixty
days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul
services; and
            (ii)   The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
three hundred sixty days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If divisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in writing to the
owner or operator.
   (F)   Consolidated application for multiple small cell facilities and/or
wireless support structures.
      (1)   Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure may
file at the applicants discretion, a consolidated application for up to 15
small cell facility requests or up to 15 wireless support structure requests in
a single application and receive a single permit for the construction,
modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell facilities or
wireless support structures subject to the following:
         (a)   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         (b)   The City may separately address small cell facility collocations
or wireless support structures for which incomplete information has been
received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
section 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code and Section 1032.19 may be
cumulative. However, the City, at its discretion may opt to reduce such fees in
order to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)   In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell facility
or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified, collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under section 4939.036 of the Ohio
Revised Code. A request by a single owner or operator for a new or replacement
support structure and associated small cell facility constitutes one request.
   
   (G)   Small Cell and Wireless Support Structure activities not requiring
consent.
      (1)   City consent shall not be required for either of the following
activities conducted in the right-of- way:
         (a)   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities; (b) The replacement
of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are consistent with the
City's current design requirements and guidelines and that are either:
            (i)   Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
            (ii)   The same size or smaller than the existing wireless
facilities.
      (2)   The City requires a Non-Residential Right-of-Way Permit for any
activity described in division (1) of this section and for any activity for

1040.01 AUXILIARY PUMPING SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Any person who attaches auxiliary pumping equipment to the Water
Distribution System, either directly or indirectly, shall first obtain a permit
for the attachment of such equipment from the Service Director.
   (b)   Such permit shall be obtained upon application to the Service Director
on forms prescribed by him, which application shall then be submitted by the
Director to Council at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Council. Upon
approval by Council the permit shall be issued by the Director within five
days.
   (c)   The application for the auxiliary pump permit, required by this
section, shall state that the applicant agrees to be subject to the continuing
regulation of Council and its lawful delegates, who may from time to time
establish and adopt, by resolution of Council, rules and regulations for the
use of auxiliary pumping equipment, a copy of which shall be sent by the
Director by ordinary, certified or registered mail, to each permit holder. The
permit, as issued, shall state that it is subject to revocation for failure to
comply with any of such rules and regulations. (Adopting Ordinance)

pressure and volume as provided by the City of Cleveland are exempted from the
requirements of this section.
(W.V. Ord. 1968-30. Passed 6-25-68.)
1040.02 SPRINKLING BAN.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to place in effect, at such times as he
may deem proper, a "sprinkling ban" by which the use of the water supply
facilities provided by the City of Cleveland for purposes of watering lawns,
gardens, crops or other growing vegetation or for other noncommercial purposes
shall be prohibited. No person shall violate such ban.
   (b)   The sprinkling ban shall only be placed in effect when, at the sole
discretion of the Mayor, the available supply and pressure of water is too low,
or threatens to become too low, to provide for the adequate use of sanitation
facilities or to allow adequate volume and pressure for combating fires which
might occur.
   (c)   Use of sprinkling equipment, hoses and facilities of a similar nature
shall be conclusively deemed to be for such purposes if the waterfall created
has the apparent primary effect of accomplishing such purposes, even though the
user purports to have another intention.
   (d)   The sprinkling ban may contain such terms as the Mayor may deem
necessary, but shall not serve to discriminate among or against any of the
residents of the City in its application insofar as its overall application is
concerned. Subjective requirements of individual water users shall not be
considered in determining the fairness of the application.
   (e)   The Mayor shall take such steps as are reasonable to notify the
residents of the City of the ban when it is in effect. Publication in the same
manner as for ordinances or in the political advertisements of the local
newspaper shall be deemed sufficient notice.
(W.V, Ord. 1968-28. Passed 6-25-68.)
1040.03 LAYING OF PIPES; FIRE HYDRANTS REQUIRED.
   Wherever, pursuant to Ohio R. C. 743.23 or the City Charter or the
ordinances of the City, particularly the Subdivision Regulations, water pipes
are being laid in streets or highways under construction or about to be paved
or otherwise permanently improved, fire hydrants shall be provided on the water
line in a number equal to at least one hydrant for each 500 feet of pipe being

particle of sewage (including the transporting medium), or any other
interference with the safe and comfortable use of surrounding property.
   (b)   Any police officer, fireman, building inspector or service employee of
the City who finds a condition prohibited by subsection (a) hereof existing
within the City shall immediately report such condition to the Mayor, who shall
designate and direct any proper officer or employee to make a complete
investigation of such condition and certify the results of such investigation
in writing to Council within forty-eight hours.

the premises or, if none is found, by mailing a copy by certified or registered
mail to the owner of record indicated in the records of the County Recorder at
the taxing address listed for such owner, in which case the date of service
shall be determined by the date of delivery to such address.
   (e)   Upon failure of the offending property owner to cause such condition
to be corrected and abated within the aforesaid twenty-four hour period,
Council may direct and cause the necessary action to be accomplished which will
immediately correct and abate such condition. Whether such action is performed
by an independent contractor or by City employees and equipment, the actual

   (a)   Whenever an ordinance of the City establishes charges for the
operation of a sewage collection, pumping or treatment facility to be billed by

charges shall reflect a discount from the normal rate, which would otherwise be
applicable, based on savings to the City as a result of being able to bill
directly and collect, as opposed to assessing.

becomes due, is billed and is not paid within thirty days after its normal due
date, the Finance Commissioner, in addition to any other action, shall notify
the owner or user prior to August 1 of each year of the charges which are
overdue and of the fact that if not so paid, an amount of ten dollars ($10.00)
per month shall be added to such charges and assessed, to reflect the loss of
discount for prepayment. If, on August 1, the bill remains unpaid, the full

quarter for each lot upon which an improvement exists and twenty dollars
($20.00) per quarter for each unimproved lot, commencing with the second
quarter of 1983.

   (b)   The assessments set forth in subsection (a) hereof shall be due and
payable at the office of the Director of Finance within thirty days after the
close of each calendar quarter for each year for which such assessment is

Auditor and the County Treasurer and shall be collected in the same manner as
other City taxes upon the tax duplicates for the relevant years. The Director
shall furnish to the Auditor and the Treasurer such other information as is
necessary to permit the identification of the property against which the sewer
maintenance assessment has been made and remains unpaid.
   (c)   The amounts specified in subsection (a) hereof, as restricted, shall
be deposited and maintained in a restricted fund to be established by the
Director, the proceeds from which may be used only for capital improvements
necessitated by the depreciation, aging and inadequacy of the originally
installed sewerage system. If there is an existing indebtedness for such
capital improvements at the time such funds are actually collected, such funds
may also be used to retire such existing indebtedness. The remainder of the
funds collected shall continue to be maintained in the sewer maintenance fund
established by Ordinance 68-77, passed December 13, 1977, to be used for
current management, maintenance, operation and repair of the sewerage system.
Whenever Council deems the amount thus on deposit to be in excess of the amount
reasonably necessary for such purposes, Council may transfer all or part of the
excess amount to the restricted capital improvement fund, which transfer shall
be permanent, and after which the sewer maintenance fund may be used for the
same purposes as the capital improvement fund. (Ord. 83- 80. Passed 10-13-80.)

which the basic charge is made and/or the number of the ordinance enacting this
section (Ordinance 10-84, passed February 13, 1984). A list showing the nature

which they are being levied, shall be kept on file in the office of the
Director for inspection by any person interested therein.

section.

waste contractor, unless the property owner requests both a commercial and

letter of delinquency by regular United States mail and the fourteen day time
period established herein shall commence on the date of such mailing. At any
time any delinquent fees for the City trash collection, plus penalties, and

1216.01 PURPOSE.
   Regardless of the facilities, sites, or open space to be privately or
commercially owned and operated, all residential developments, including
single-family subdivisions in D-1 through D-4 Districts, single-family attached
developments in D-4 and D-5 Districts, multi-family developments in the D-
5 District, planned residential developments, and residential developments in
an MUPD District, shall be required to provide for public parks and public open
space in accordance with the regulations set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1216.02 PUBLIC FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   The requirements for providing for public parks and public open space may,
at the Planning Commission's discretion, be met in one of the following ways:
   (a)   The applicant (developer) shall offer for dedication 1,200 square feet
of land area per dwelling unit;
   (b)   The applicant (developer) shall pay to the City the per dwelling unit
fee established by Council based on the total number of dwelling units proposed
in the development plan or subdivision; or
   (c)   The applicant (developer) shall pay the fee for a portion of the
dwelling units and offer land for dedication for the remaining dwelling units.
   The Planning Commission shall determine the manner in which the public parks
and public open space requirement will be met. The Planning Commission shall
use the Comprehensive Plan as a guide in determining whether to accept the
dedication of land or the payment of the fee in lieu of the land for dedication
as a public park or public open space site and shall consider the topography,
drainage, soil conditions, and accessibility of the parcel. Prior to making a
determination, the Planning Commission shall refer the proposal to the Parks
and Recreation Board for its advice and recommendation.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1216.03 WAIVER OF REQUIREMENT.
   The Planning Commission (with guidance from the Parks and Recreation Board)
may determine that private recreational facilities or common open space
provided as part of a planned residential development or MUPD, or associated
with a single-family attached or multi-family development, are of equivalent
value to provide adequate open space opportunities for the residents of the
proposed development that would otherwise need to be provided by the City. In
such case, the Planning Commission may waive all or a portion of the
requirement set forth in Section
1216.02.
   (a)   In making such a determination, the Planning Commission shall consider
the type and size of facilities provided, the availability of the facilities to
the residents, and the likelihood that such facilities will lessen the need for
additional public parks and public open space for the residents.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (b)   Any private recreation facilities or common open space accepted as
meeting the requirements of this chapter shall be improved, (including grading,
seeding, drainage, etc.) as recommended by the City Engineer, and approved by
the Planning Commission.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1216.04 USE OF FUNDS COLLECTED.
   The payments made by the developer in accordance with Section
1216.02(b) or (c) shall be deposited in a special account and shall be used
solely for the acquisition and improvement of the public parks and public open
space facilities required to meet the need for such facilities created by the
population increase caused by the new development. Such account shall utilize
full and adequate accounting procedures.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)

1218.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare through the preservation, replacement, and planting of trees in
order to lessen air pollution, intercept airborne particulate matter, reduce
noise and light glare, moderate air temperature, moderate storm water runoff,
reduce erosion and sedimentation, maintain wildlife habitats, provide visual
screening, provide natural shading, protect property values, and enhance the
natural beauty of Olmsted Falls.
(Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.02 APPLICABILITY.
   The regulations of this Chapter shall apply to all lands in the City except
as exempted in subsection (d) hereof.
   (a)   No land shall be cleared of trees nor shall any tree with a DBH of
eight (8) inches or greater be cleared or removed without first obtaining a
permit pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter.
   (b)   All development plans, subdivision plans, and new construction shall
comply with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (c)   No building permit or grading plan shall be approved without
conformance with this Chapter.
   (d)   The following shall be exempt from the regulations of this Chapter and
from the requirement for a tree removal permit:
      (1)   The removal of dead, diseased, or damaged trees.
      (2)   Any tree on public property or within street rights-of-way.
      (3)   The removal of trees necessary for construction, operation, and
maintenance of public streets, water lines, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and
drainage facilities.
      (4)   The removal of trees necessary for the installation, maintenance,
and repair of overhead utilities or underground utilities.
      (5)   The removal of trees in time of emergency or which pose a potential
danger.
      (6)   The removal of trees by an individual single-family homeowner on
their individual single-family lot.
         (Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.03 DEFINITIONS.
   The following terms are defined for the purposes of this chapter:
   (a)   Buildable area:  The area of construction for a building and parking
area, including a distance of fifteen feet around the perimeter of the
foundation of the building.
   (b)   Clearing:   Any act that causes a tree or other vegetation to decline
and/or die. Such acts shall include, but not be limited to, damage inflicted
upon the root system of the vegetation by the application of toxic substances,
by the operation of equipment and vehicles, by the storage of materials, by the
change of natural grade due to unapproved excavation or filling, or by the
unapproved alteration of natural physical conditions.
   (c)   Criticalroot zone (CRZ): This is the circular area surrounding a tree
in which the tree's roots critical to its survival usually will be found, and
which should be protected. The radius of the CRZ in feet is, typically, 1.5
times the DBH in inches. For example, if a tree's DBH is 10 inches then the CRZ
is 1.5 times 10, resulting in a CRZ radius of 15 feet. This formula is
particularly useful in dealing with trees that have been growing in a forest or
that naturally have a narrow growth habit. Recognizing that the root zone
varies with tree variety, the actual radius for the critical root zones shall
be approved by the City Arborist.
      (Ord. 73-2018. Passed 1-8-19.)
   (d)   DBH:   Diameter-at-breast-height is tree trunk diameter measured in
inches at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground.
   (e)   Protective barriers:    Structural measures, such as fencing or berms,
installed prior to construction for the purpose of preventing damage to trees
during construction.
   (f)   Tree:   Any self-supporting woody plant growing upon the earth that
usually provides one main trunk and produces a more or less distinct and
elevated head with many branches.
   (g)   Trees of quality: These are trees within a natural wooded area that
can be expected to be a future asset to the property as determined by the City
Arborist.
   (h)   Trees, unacceptable species:   Trees designated as such by the City's
Shade-Tree Commission.
   (i)   Wooded areas:  A grouping of trees and other woody plants covering a
land area of 10,000 square feet or greater, with at least ten trees per 10,000
square feet (or an average of at least 40 trees per acre) having a two inch or
greater DBH.
      (Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.04 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR WOODED AREAS.
   It is recognized that there are three different ways in which wooded areas
may be utilized within new developments. These different uses require different
management and preservation approaches. It is further recognized that existing
wooded areas may consist of quality trees mixed with undesirable trees and
undesirable underbrush. The three utilization methods are as follows:
   (a)   Natural undisturbed.   Some developments may include, when completed,
large wooded areas that are appropriate to have remain in their natural state.
These areas shall be shown on the Tree Preservation and Management Plan and be
approved by the Planning Commission as "Natural Undisturbed" areas after review
and comment by the City Arborist.
   (b)   Buffer zones or screening.   In some cases, the trees of a wooded area
may be utilized to provide (or contribute to providing) a required buffering or
screening function. It will be necessary to identify specific trees or groups
of trees that are appropriate for the screening/buffering purpose, with the
balance to be removed without damaging those to be saved. Additional trees or
other landscaping approaches may need to be added to achieve the intended
purpose. The quality of the existing trees and their suitability, either
individually or as a group, for the screening or buffering plan shall be
proposed by the developer, documented in the TP&M Plan, and reviewed and
recommended to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the City Arborist.
(Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.05 REGULATIONS FOR ALL DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   All proposed subdivisions and developments shall be designed to
preserve, where possible, healthy trees and woodlands, especially trees
providing natural buffering and trees having a caliper of eight (8) inches or
greater, according to the following provisions:
       (1)   Design and layout criteria.
         A.   Existing trees of quality, including but not limited to, trees in
areas that are located outside the approved buildable area, in street rights-
of-way, and in drainage ways and utility easements, shall be preserved to the
extent practicable.
         B.   Building elevations and street elevations shall be designed to
minimize the change in the existing natural grade.
         C.   Buildings and parking areas should be located to fit into the
existing topography and preserve the natural amenities of the site.
      (2)   Canopy Replacement. All new developments shall preserve, relocate,
or plant trees on the site in order to create a future tree canopy cover in
accordance with the following schedule:
         A.   D-1, D-2, D-3 = 40%
         B.   D-4, D-5 = 35%
         C.   PRD = 30%
         D.   MUTND, P-1, P-2 = 25%
         E.   C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1, I-2 = 20%
Future canopy cover shall be calculated based upon tree maturity at thirty (30)
years using the criteria set forth in the Street Tree Fact Sheets as calculated
by the City Arborist and Street Tree Commission who shall make report their
findings and analysis to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
 
   (b)   TP&M Plan Required.  A TP&M Plan, as described in Section
1218.06, shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission at the time
of the submittal of the Overall Conceptual Plan, the Preliminary Plat, or the
Preliminary Development Plan, as appropriate. In addition, "street trees" are
required along all streets as stated in the Improvement Standards of the City
of Olmsted Falls .
(Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.06 TREE PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT (TP&M) PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   Before any clearing or disturbance of the property pursuant to the
requirements of this Chapter, a TP&M Plan shall be presented to and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (a)   The submission and approval of the TP&M Plan can be a phased process
if the project itself is phased.
         (1)   Initial Overall TP&M Plan. An Initial Overall TP&M Plan shall be
provided at an appropriate scale that shows wooded areas within the total area
and that provides some of the details required by Section
1218.07 by identifying in a general way the condition of the trees in those
areas that are to be cleared for roadways, utilities, etc. The roadways and
utility areas shall be located so as to preserve desirable trees insofar as is
practicable. In addition, , the planned uses of the wooded areas shall be
indicated in terms as defined in
1218.04, at least for those portions to be utilized as "Natural Undisturbed" or
for "Buffer Zones or Screening".
         (2)   Detailed TP&M Plan. A detailed TP&M Plan shall be prepared by
qualified individual and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission as
part of a request for Preliminary Plat Approval for a subdivision or
Preliminary Development Plan Approval. The Tree Protection and Management Plan
shall comply with Subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   The Tree Protection and Management Plan shall be drawn at an
appropriate scale and shall indicate the following:
      (1)   Specific wooded areas that are proposed for use as "Natural
Undisturbed", or "Buffer Zones or Screening as defined in Section
1218.04 shall be delineated
      (2)   All individual trees greater than eight (8) inch caliper that are
not part of a wooded area to be preserved and counted in the tree canopy
replacement;
      (3)   All new trees to be planted on the site to meet the minimum canopy
replacement requirements set forth in Section
1218.05(a)(2); and
      (4)   The location and outline of all existing and proposed buildings,
driveways, parking lots, and drainage ways on the property.
      (5)   Tree aeration systems if proposed.
   (c)   The TP&M Plan(s) must be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and receive its approval prior to any clearance or disturbance of
the property. The Planning and Zoning Commission may request review comments
from the Shade Tree Commission for street areas and /or public property and may
request additional review from the City Arborist and/or City Engineer.
      (Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.07 TREE PROTECTION METHODS.
   All existing trees to be retained shall be protected during construction
according to the following tree-protection methods.
   (a)   Tree Protection Zones. The development plan or subdivision plat shall
show the number and location of existing trees as required by these regulations
and shall further indicate all those marked for retention. All trees to be
retained shall be designated in identified tree protection zones on the
landscape plan submitted as part of the development plan or subdivision plat.
(Tree protection zones for trees on adjacent properties whose critical root
zones extend into the subject property must also be delineated.) The plan may
include multiple zones, which do not need to be contiguous. The tree protection
zones shall at a minimum encompass the critical root zones of all existing
trees to be retained.
   (b)   Placement of Tree Protective Barriers. Tree protection zones shall be
protected according to the following:
      (1)   Prior to construction, clearing, or other disturbance of the
property, all trees or groups of trees to be preserved shall be marked with a
blue ribbon or blue paint-stripe and tree protective barriers located so as to
totally encompass the perimeter of the tree protective zones. Such barriers
shall be of orange plastic construction fencing that is at least four and one-
half (4 ½) feet in height and held in place by seven (7) foot poles placed on
no more than eight (8) foot centers.
      (2)   Protective barriers shall remain in place until construction is
complete, landscaping is installed, and an occupancy permit has been issued.
      (3)   No land disturbance, including grading or filling, shall occur
within the tree protection zone except as may be approved by the City Engineer
when a tree aeration system is installed. Tree aeration systems, if recommended
by the City Arborist and required by the Planning Commission, shall be shown on
the TP&M Plan and their installation shall be monitored by the City Arborist.
      (4)   Areas within the tree protection zones shall not be disturbed in
any way. They shall be kept free of all building materials, dirt, chemicals
(including fuels and lubricants), contaminated water or other foreign
materials, construction debris, and vehicles. Personnel shall not enter those
zones except to perform essential tree and landscaping functions.
         (Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.08 TREE INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   New trees required to be planted in order to meet the minimum tree
requirements set forth herein shall be installed according to an approved
landscape or tree preservation plan within six months of completion of the
building and prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit, unless otherwise
approved by the City Engineer. Performance and maintenance bonds shall be
provided per Section
1224.09(a) and (b). If the weather makes planting impractical, an extension, if
requested in writing, may be granted by the City Engineer. Failure to install
the trees within the required time shall result in forfeiture of the bond to
the City to be used for the installation of required trees.

fulfillment of this requirement.
(Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1218.09 INSPECTIONS, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   The City may inspect the site during construction to insure that, in
accordance with the approved Tree Protection and Management Plan, the trees and
their root- zones are being properly protected and remain undamaged. If
violations or damage is found, the construction may be stopped until remedies
are provided.
 
   (b)   Any tree in excess of eight (8) inch caliper that is damaged, or whose
critical root-zone is imperiled to such extent as to seriously injure the tree
and/or make its survival for two years uncertain, is to be replaced with a tree
having a minimum caliper of two and one-half (2.5) inches for deciduous trees
and a minimum height of eight (8) feet for evergreen trees.

1224.01 PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this chapter are established to achieve effective,
efficient, and uniform administration of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1224.02 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF MINOR SUBDIVISIONS OR OF A COMBINATION OR
REALIGNMENT OF LOTS.
   No minor subdivision or combination or realignment of lots shall be recorded
prior to Planning Commission approval. The procedure for such approval is as
follows:
   (a)   Definitions. As used in this section:
      (1)   A minor subdivision is the subdivision of a parcel of land which
abuts an existing public street, and which does not involve the opening,
widening, or extension of any street, and which does not include more than five
lots after the original parcel has been completely subdivided. A lot split in
which one parcel is split into two parcels is considered a minor subdivision.
      (2)   A lot combination means the joining of two or more lots into one
lot or parcel.
      (3)   Lot realignment means an alteration of the boundaries between or
among existing lots that does not result in an increase in the number of lots.
   (b)   Application. An application for approval of a minor subdivision or a
combination or realignment of lots shall include the following items, with the
number of copies as determined by the Zoning Administrator:
      (1)   An application for approval of a minor subdivision or combination
or realignment of lots (Form S-1) certified by the developer along with the
required filing fee and review deposit;
      (2)   A sketch plan at a scale of one inch equals fifty feet, showing:
         A.   Original lot and parcel number;
         B.   Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of owners and subdivider;
         C.   Sketch of parcel(s) proposed to be subdivided showing bearings
and distances and all contiguous land of same ownership and land within 100
feet therefrom, all based on available record data; and
         D.   Existing zoning districts, lot size and yard requirements, and
proof of any variance or special exceptions which may have been granted, or
deed restrictions.
      (3)   If this is an application for a minor subdivision, the applicant
shall also include:
         A.   A sketch plan of the existing streets, utilities, easements, and
other conditions on or within 100 feet of the proposed subdivision, such as
watercourses, marshes, structures, or other significant features; and
         B.   A statement and sketch of how sewage disposal and water supply
will be provided. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
         C.   Before any construction on, or clearing of, the property, a Tree
Protection and Management Plan shall be submitted pursuant to Chapter
1218. In addition, if, at any time, one or more of the lots is to have a
structure built upon it for other than single-family detached dwellings, then a
Development Plan pursuant to Section
1232.06(a) shall be provided.
   (c)   Referral. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Zoning
Administrator shall place it on the agenda of the next regular Planning
Commission meeting that is more than ten days from the Zoning Administrator’s
receipt of the application. The filing date of the application shall be the
date of the meeting.
If a TP&M Plan and/or Screening Plan and Landscaping Plan have been required,
they shall be referred to the City Arborist, Shade Tree Commission (for street
areas and/or public property), and the ABR [see
1206.04(b)(4)] for comment and action as appropriate. (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-
11-05.)
   (d)   Engineer's Report. Prior to Commission action, the Commission shall
require the Engineer to certify his or her findings on Form S-1 and return it
to the Secretary.
   (e)   Commission Action. Following a review of the application and the
Engineer's report, the Commission shall, at or before the next meeting
following the filing meeting, approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the
application. The Secretary shall certify the action on Form S-1 and forward it
to the Zoning Administrator for return to the developer. Approval shall be
granted if:
      (1)   The parcel to be subdivided abuts a public street and does not
involve the opening, widening, or extension of any street;
      (2)   Not more than five lots will be included after the original parcel
has been completely subdivided; or
      (3)   The subdivision conforms to these Subdivision Regulations, the
Zoning Code, other applicable Municipal, County, and State law, and the
Comprehensive Plan.
   (f)   Plat Submission. Following Commission approval of a minor subdivision,
the developer shall submit a plat thereof to the Zoning Administrator, or the
Engineer as appropriate.
      (1)   Plat requirements. The plat shall be prepared by a professional
surveyor at a scale of one inch equals fifty feet and shall include the
following:
         A.   Original lot and parcel number;
         B.   Boundary line survey and control points showing all dimensions,
angles, and bearings to control points; and
         C.   Building setback lines accurately shown with dimensions.
      (2)   Plat certification. If the Zoning Administrator, or the Engineer as
appropriate, finds that the plat conforms to the approved subdivision, he or
she shall certify approval on Form S-1 and on the original tracing of the plat.
Following recording, the developer shall furnish the Zoning Administrator with
a duplicate linen or mylar tracing at no cost to the City. Planning Commission
approval of a minor subdivision or a combination or realignment of lots shall
become void after 120 days if the approved subdivision has not been recorded by
the County Recorder. At any point in the process outlined in this section, the
Zoning Administrator may, if he or she deems it necessary, request the
assistance of the Engineer to accomplish the certification called for in this
section.
      (3)   Waiver of standards. Whenever the Planning Commission, in reviewing
an application for minor subdivision approval, determines that the strict
enforcement of standards for curbs and gutters, sidewalks, or other
improvements specified in improvement standards would be unreasonable or
unfeasible, it may, by majority action, waive such requirements as it deems
necessary.
          A.   Such actions may include requirements for improvements in a
minor subdivision which are located so as to preclude timely connection with
similar existing improvements. The Zoning Administrator or the Engineer shall
recommend such waiver of improvements if his or her studies indicate the
necessity or desirability of such waiver. Such waiver action by the Planning
Commission shall be so noted on the final record plat.
         B.   No such action shall be taken which would impair the objectives
of these Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Code, or other applicable
ordinances of the City.
             (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
1224.03 ACTION ON MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   The steps to approval of a major subdivision are summarized in this section.
The specific requirements involved in each of these steps are set forth in
Sections
1224.04 through
1224.12. In the event there is a discrepancy between the summary below and the

discuss the proposed subdivision. Upon review of the sketch plan, the
Commission shall determine whether or not the subdivision is in keeping with
these Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Code, other applicable Municipal,
County, and State laws, and the Comprehensive Plan. If necessary, the
Commission shall make recommendations which shall be incorporated in the
preliminary plat of the subdivision. If the developer contemplates dividing the
proposed subdivision into two or more phases, such phasing, together with a
time schedule therefor, shall be submitted with the sketch plan. If the
proposed project is part of, or associated with, a planned development, the
developer shall disclose the manner in which he or she proposes to submit the
planned development; either simultaneously with or subsequent to the procedures
for the subdivision.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)

portion thereof has not been approved by the Commission and recorded by the
County Recorder. Preliminary plat approval shall remain in effect so long as
the developer presents every year thereafter final plats for portions thereof
which comply substantially with phases of the subdivision approved by the
Commission when the preliminary plat was approved.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1224.06 PROCEDURE FOR IMPROVEMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   No improvement of any subdivision shall commence, and no final plat of the
subdivision shall be approved, prior to certification by the Engineer of
approval of improvement plans and approval by the Planning Commission. The
procedure for such approval is as follows:
   (a)   Application. Applications for improvement plan approval shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator who shall then forward them to the
Engineer. Applications shall include:
      (1)   Two copies of the Application for Improvement Plan Approval. (Form
S-3) certified by the developer along with the required review deposit; and
      (2)   The improvement plans drawn in ink on tracing cloth or mylar by a
professional engineer with two sets of identical prints showing:
         A.    Subdivision identification. Subdivision name, original lot and
parcel number;
         B.   Identity of owners, subdivider and engineer. Names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of owners, subdivider, and professional engineer (and
seal);
         C.   Certification. City Engineer's Certification of Approval of
Improvements as specified on Form S-3;
         D.   Drainage plans. A complete drainage study shall be made using the
rational method with the variable adjusted to suit the particular locality
which shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer. A complete computation
sheet shall be submitted showing pipe or sewer sizes selected. Consideration
shall be given to the theory of critical flow, and the grades of storm sewers
and culverts shall not be arbitrarily increased in order to reduce required
pipe size. Methods used in calculating sizes of pipe and structures and the
design and location shall be acceptable to the City Engineer. On the
topographic map to be included with the plans, the area in acres draining to
each inlet shall be shown. Each area shall be numbered or lettered with its
outline clearly shown together with the acres per manhole-to-manhole increment
employed to arrive at the pipe size of such increment. Should site conditions
be encountered within the subdivision, a bridge or sectional plate culvert may
be designed, subject to approval of the City Engineer. Separate sheets for such
structure shall be included in the plans, completely detailed and indicating
the highway roading for which it is designed.
         E.   Plans and profiles. Plans and profiles of all streets shall be
prepared on half-plan and half-profile cloth, with the street plan at the top
of the sheet and the profile at the bottom. Horizontal scale shall not be less
than one inch equals fifty feet, and vertical scale shall not be less than one
inch equals five feet or one-tenth of the horizontal scale. Plan sheets shall
show the street centerline, centerline stationing, street names or letter
designation, sublot numbers, right- of-way lines, pavement lines, storm and
sanitary sewer lines, inlets, manholes, culverts, gutterlines, guard rails,
monuments, P.C. and P.T. of all horizontal curves, together with curve data,
appropriate notes covering construction, a title block and north point. Sheets
shall be numbered in an orderly, consecutive manner so that one sheet is
numbered in order for one sheet to follow the preceding sheet in a logical
sequence. The profile portion of the sheet shall show the original ground
profile at the centerline and at both building setback lines and the proposed
profile grade with all vertical curve data, including the calculated nonpassing
sight distance for all convex curves.
         F.   Stationing. Stationing, corresponding to plan stationing, shall
be shown on the profile, and sea level elevations shall be indicated thereon.
The location and description of the U.S.G.S. bench mark used shall be shown in
a box, either on the plan or profile portion of the sheet.
         G.   Typical sections. The typical section of the proposed roadway
selected from these Subdivision Regulations shall be included, preferably on
the sheet with other details of construction. The typical section shall show
the right-of-way width, pavement width, berm width, and location of gutters,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water mains, inlets, guard rails, etc. The
vertical scale may be exaggerated to show the thickness of each layer of
roadway material, its kind and covering specifications. Appropriate notes for
each type of material proposed to be used shall be placed directly below the
section.
         H.   Construction details. Construction details for all special types
of construction proposed shall be included, preferably on the separate sheets
with the typical section. Included shall be special ditch checks, headwalls,
concrete aprons, unusual size inlets and manholes, guard rails, barricades,
cut-off walls, cradles, etc.
         I.   Landscaping and tree details for non-PRD single family
developments. A landscaping plan shall be submitted, showing all existing and
proposed trees and screening along streets and including details regarding
spacing; the distance of trees from curbs, street intersections, private
driveways, and street lights; and the minimum size of each tree and the minimum
distance from the ground to its lowest branch. The plan shall be in accordance
with the objectives of Policy No. 29 (January, 1964) of the American Society of
Landscape Architects, as amended.
   (b)   Engineer Action. Upon receipt of a complete application, the Engineer
shall approve the application if it conforms to the approved preliminary plat,
these Subdivision Regulations, Planning Commission policies, and other
applicable Municipal, County, and State laws. The Engineer's approval and
findings shall be certified on Form S-3 which shall then be forwarded to the
Law Director. The Engineer will define the amount of the performance bond to
insure completion of the improvements by the required date, and the amount of
the deposit for the inspection of improvements and for the maintenance of the
completed improvements for the appropriate period. Approval shall not be made
by the Engineer subject to conditions or notations specified by him or her on
the improvement plans.
   (c)   Law Director Action. Upon receipt of Form S-3, the Law Director may
approve the application if all of the provisions specified on Form S-3, have
been complied with. The Law Director shall certify his or her approval on Form
S-3 and return it to the Engineer.
   (d)   Zoning Administrator Action. The Zoning Administrator will be
responsible for reviewing improvement plans relative to subsection (a)(2)(I)
above to confirm consistency with prior approvals.
   (e)   Certification. Following approval by the Law Director, the Engineer
shall certify approval on the original tracings of the improvement plans. The
developer shall furnish the Engineer with a set of duplicate linen or mylar
tracings at no cost to the City.
   (f)   Approval by Planning Commission. Approval of improvement plans by the
Planning Commission is required and shall be a part of the action of approval
of the final plat.
   (g)   Modification. If modification to the approved improvement plans is
requested by the developer, written authority by the Engineer shall be received
by the developer before the modification is made. If any modification to the
originally approved plans is granted by the Engineer, the developer shall
furnish the Engineer with a duplicate mylar tracing of any modified tracing at
no cost to the City. The Engineer shall advise the Planning Commission of all
modifications. If the modifications affect or modify a final plan in any
significant manner, the reapproval of the plat by the Planning Commission shall
be obtained.
   (h)   Construction of Improvements. Only after approval of the final plat as
set forth in Section
1224.07 and the deposit of the proper amounts for bonds and inspections, shall
the improvements be installed. It is not necessary, at this time, to install
those specific minor improvements (such as sidewalks, street light fixtures,
tree lawns, and the planting of trees) that would be adversely affected by the
subsequent construction of buildings; however, a bond in an amount which
insures the completion of these minor improvements must remain on deposit.
Acceptance of completed improvements shall be certified by the Engineer on the
original tracings of the improvement plans.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1224.07 PROCEDURE FOR FINAL PLAT APPROVAL.
   Following approval of a preliminary plat and improvement plans, the
developer may, within the time and phasing limits specified, make application
to the Planning Commission for final plat approval. Where the approved
preliminary plat encompasses phasing, final plats and improvement plans may be

plat shall be certified by Chairperson of the Commission on the original
tracing of the plat, which shall be for record purposes only and shall not
indicate acceptance of dedication. Such final plat approval shall become void
after sixty days if the final plat has not been recorded by the County
Recorder. If, in the Commission’s judgment, the proposed final plat differs
significantly from the approved preliminary plat, reapplication for reapproval
of the preliminary plat shall be required. Approval of the final plat shall be
granted if both of the following are true.
         A.   The general layout of streets, lots, open spaces, and other
features of the final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plat.
         B.   Conditions of approval of the preliminary plat have been met.
   (d)   After approval of the final plat and the deposit of the proper amount
for bonds and inspections, the plat shall be recorded with the County and the
construction of improvements may begin. As set forth in Section
1224.06(g), minor improvements such as sidewalks, street light fixtures, tree
lawns, and the planting of trees, etc., that would be adversely affected by the
subsequent construction of buildings, shall not be required to be constructed
until the appropriate time. However, a bond in an amount which insures the
completion of these improvements must remain on deposit after completion of the
required major improvements.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1224.08 PROCEDURE FOR DEDICATION.
   No building permit in a major subdivision shall be issued by the Zoning
Administrator prior to acceptance or rejection by Council of all public land,
public streets, etc., shown on the final plat for dedication (with the
exception that the Planning Commission may approve the construction of model
homes prior to dedication, provided an occupancy permit shall not be issued
until after dedication), and no plat shall be accepted for dedication
consideration until all improvements are in (see Section
1224.06(g)) and certified as complete by the City Engineer. The procedure for
dedication is as follows:
   (a)   Application. Applications for acceptance of dedication shall include:
      (1)   Two copies of Form S-5 certified by the developer, the Engineer and
the Law Director;
      (2)   The original tracing of the final plat approved by the Engineer,
the Law Director and the Planning Commission; and
      (3)   The required review deposit.
   (b)   Referral. Upon receipt of an application certified as stated above,
the Clerk of Council shall place it on the agenda of the next regular Council
meeting. The filing date of the application shall be the date of the meeting.
   (c)   Council Action. Following review of the application, Council shall,
within thirty days, accept or reject for dedication all or part of the public
land, public streets, etc., shown on the final plat. The Clerk shall certify
the action on Form S-5 and return it to the Engineer. The Clerk and the
President of Council shall certify acceptance of dedication on the original
tracing of the final plat. Following recording, the developer shall furnish the
Engineer with a duplicate tracing at no cost to the City. The Engineer shall
then notify the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that building permits in the
subdivision may be issued.
   (d)   Completion of Improvements. The remaining minor improvements,
described in Section
1224.06(g), shall be completed and any required maintenance bonds must be
posted with the Finance Director before occupancy permits are issued for any
new structures.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1224.09 PERFORMANCE BONDS, MAINTENANCE BONDS AND INSURANCE.
   (a)   Performance Bonds.
      (1)   The developer shall be primarily liable for completion of the
approved public and private improvements for which he or she has filed an
application. Upon failure of completion within the specified time, or any
extension granted by Council or by the Planning Commission for good cause
shown, the City may, at its option, complete all or any portion of the
improvements, and the developer shall be liable to the City for the costs of
such completion, plus an additional twenty-five percent of such costs to cover
City overhead.
      (2)   To secure such performance, the developer shall file with the Law
Director, in a form approved by the Law Director, a construction performance
bond or letter of credit covering the satisfactory and timely completion of
improvements. No extension granted to the developer shall operate as a release
of such bond. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the Engineer, who
shall require of the developer such information as the Engineer deems necessary
to reasonably estimate the cost of performance. The amount of the bond shall be
100 percent of such amount.
      (3)   Should the City exercise its option to complete all or any portion
of the improvements, the bond amount shall be declared forfeited and the costs
of completion, plus overhead, shall be charged against such amount. Upon
expiration of the maintenance bond at no cost to the City, as provided in
subsection (f) hereof, the balance of the bonded fund shall be returned to the
surety.
      (4)   No bond shall be accepted unless it is provided in the form of cash
or a bond written by a surety company licensed to write such bonds in the
State.
   (b)   Maintenance Bonds.
      (1)   Prior to the acceptance of improvements by the Engineer, the
developer shall file with the Law Director, in a form approved by the Law
Director, a maintenance bond guaranteeing the developer's obligation to repair
or replace any such improvements which have been found to require maintenance
or which have failed for any cause whatsoever. The amount of the bond shall be
determined by the Engineer, who may require of the developer such information
as the Engineer deems necessary to reasonably estimate the potential cost of
maintenance, and who shall then evaluate such data and other information
available to him or her and estimate the maximum amount, barring unforeseeable
circumstances, that such maintenance should cost. Should the developer fail to
provide adequate maintenance, repair, or replacement within a twenty-four month
period following acceptance of the improvements by the Engineer, the City shall
have the option of providing, either through its own employees or independent
contractors, such maintenance, repair, or replacement, or any part thereof. In
such event, the bond shall be declared forfeited, and the costs of such work,
plus twenty-five percent to cover the costs of City overhead, shall be deducted
therefrom. The balance of the bonded fund shall be retained by the City until
released as provided in this section, and shall, while retained, be the subject
of further maintenance, repair, or replacement charges.
      (2)   At the end of the twenty-four-month period, the developer shall
apply in writing to the Engineer for an inspection of the improvements.
Alternatively, such inspection may be requested not more than thirty days in
advance of such expiration date. Upon receipt of an application, the Engineer
shall inspect the improvements. Any corrections reasonably deemed by the
Engineer to be necessary shall be made by the developer, or the maintenance
bond fund shall be used to make such corrections.
      (3)   When the Engineer finds that all necessary maintenance, if any, has
been completed, and that the improvements are in a condition satisfactory to
him or her, then the bond, or the balance of the bond fund, shall be released,
upon proper certification of such facts by the Engineer.
      (4)   Any bond required by this section shall be in the form of cash or a
bond written by a surety company licensed to write such bonds in the State.
   (c)   Combined Bonds. Guarantees for performance and maintenance may be
combined into a single instrument, provided it is in an amount approved by the
Engineer and in a form approved by the Law Director. At any time during the
existence of approved performance and/or maintenance bonds, the developer may
exchange one form of guarantee for another, provided that the substitution is
approved by the Law Director.
   (d)   Insurance. In accordance with Section 1452.01(F) of the Codified
Ordinances, the developer agrees to hold the City harmless from any and all
claims of any type, nature, and description whatsoever, arising from the
provision of improvements or other activities covered by these Subdivision
Regulations. In addition, the developer shall defend and pay costs and
judgments resulting from such claims upon reasonable notification of the
pendency of the claim by the City or by any party. The developer shall not be
responsible for claims arising from the sole negligence of an employee of the
City.
      (1)   The developer shall furnish the Law Director with a certificate of
insurance, or, at the option of the Law Director, a certified copy of the
insurance policy, as proof that the developer and his or her subcontractors are
covered by general liability insurance for all activities contemplated by the
project, including products liability coverage, in sufficient amounts
established by Council. Such policy shall contain no unusual exclusions, shall
name the City as an additional insured, and shall not be cancelable as to the
City on less than thirty days written notice in advance of such cancellation.
      (2)   The developer shall further produce and keep on file with the Clerk
of Council evidence that he or she has fully complied with the provisions of
the Ohio Workers Compensation Act.
      (3)   The Law Director shall promptly certify his or her findings in this
regard in Form S-3. In the event of later cancellation of any insurance
required by this subsection, the developer shall cease all work not covered by
insurance as of the time and date of lapse of coverage, and the Zoning
Administrator or the Law Director may take any necessary action to enforce such
work stoppage until coverage resumes.
         (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
         
1224.10 CONFORMITY WITH MAPPED STREET PLANS; ISSUANCE OF BUILDING AND ZONING
PERMITS.
   No subdivision within an area shown on a duly adopted mapped street plan
shall be approved unless it substantially conforms thereto. No building or
zoning permit involving a structure within any street right of way shown on
such mapped street plan shall be issued for 120 days after the filing date of
the permit application, such period of time being deemed necessary for Council
to initiate appropriation proceedings.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1224.11 REVOCATION OF PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   Upon the effective date of these Subdivision Regulations, or any amendment
thereto, the Secretary of the Planning Commission shall notify the developer of
any subdivision for which a preliminary plat has been approved that such
approval shall become void one year after the date of the notice if improvement
plans which conform to the previous Subdivision Regulations of the City have
not been approved by the Engineer.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1224.12 RESUBDIVISION AND VACATION.
   Application for resubdivision and vacation of subdivisions shall be made by
the developer to the Planning Commission according to the same procedures as
for an original subdivision. The original lots shall be shown by dotted lines,
and lot numbers and other references made on the previously recorded
subdivision shall also be shown. Any resubdivision shall contain an abandonment
of any claim, right, title, or interest in the original subdivision and any
vacation shall be approved by Council and noted in the same manner as a
dedication.

1226.01 PURPOSE.
   The planning standards in this chapter are established to achieve the
objectives of these Subdivision Regulations. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1226.02 IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Defined: The standards for construction of the required improvements
are contained in a document separate from this Code and shall be prepared by
the City Engineer, reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission, and
adopted by Council. Such construction standards shall be referred to in this
Planning and Zoning Code as the Improvement Standards. The Planning Commission,
under certain conditions, may waive some of the requirements of the Improvement
Standards as stated within those standards.
   (b)   Responsibilities of Developer: The developer shall provide the
improvements specified below within his or her proposed subdivision and shall
provide off-site and oversized improvements required to serve the proposed
subdivision, as determined by the City Engineer. All off-site and oversized
improvements shall be available to serve adjoining land.
   The following improvements shall be furnished, constructed, and installed
according to improvement plans approved by the City Engineer, which shall
comply with the construction specifications in the Improvement Standards:
      Grading and drainage;
      Streets, including pavement; curbs and gutters; and sidewalks;
      Street name signs;
      Street trees and screening;
      Communication systems;
      Street lights;
      Telephone and cable lines;
      Gas fuel services and electric lines;
      Sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and water service systems, including storm
water
      management systems; and
      Survey monuments.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1226.03 CONFORMITY TO COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND ZONING CODE.
   The arrangement and character of subdivisions shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan and to the regulations set forth in this Planning and Zoning
Code.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1226.04 NATURAL FEATURES.
   Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the existing natural
features on the site in a manner which results in an attractive environment and
which minimizes grading and the removal of trees and topsoil.
   (a)   Topography. Subdivisions on land which is relatively flat shall be
planned so that streets follow natural drainage courses. On more irregular
topography, streets shall generally parallel natural contours to avoid
extensive cut and fill. Where practical, lots shall be above street grade.
Other standards for grading are set forth in the improvement standards.
   (b)   Natural Drainage. Subdivisions shall be designed to take advantage of
natural contours so that the land can be drained with a minimum of reshaping.
Rear lot lines shall be parallel to drainage courses so that, where practical,
open drainage courses do not parallel side lot lines. Such restrictions do not
apply to enclosed drainage courses. Drainage courses, marshes, and areas which
are subject to flooding shall not be utilized as building sites. Other grading
and drainage standards are set forth in the improvement standards.
   (c)   Flood Areas. Due consideration shall be given to any portion of land
within a proposed subdivision which is subject to flooding. Such land shall not
be platted for development which may increase danger to health, life, or
property or which may aggravate flooding (see Chapter 1477 of these Codified
Ordinances).
   (d)   Other Natural Features. Natural features, such as substantial tree
cover, waterways, lakes, hills, and open spaces, within a proposed subdivision
or related thereto, shall be integrated into the design of the subdivision to
obtain natural variety and interest in each neighborhood and the most
attractive views possible. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1226.05 TREE PRESERVATION AND MANAGEMENT.
   Editor’s Note: See Chapter
1218.
1226.06 STREETS.
   Streets shall be designed to implement the Comprehensive Plan and shall
comply with the following standards:
   (a)   Arterial Streets. The arrangement, size, and location of arterial
streets shall be based on the Comprehensive Plan and shall be planned for
continuity and interconnection with other arterial streets at the same width
as, or at a greater width than, the width of the other arterial street in
accordance with City, County, and State standards. Access to arterial streets
shall be controlled in the interest of public safety and to maintain traffic
flow. Wherever a subdivision abuts an arterial street, one or more of the
following may be required:
      (1)   Marginal access streets parallel to the arterial street;
      (2)   Double-frontage lots between arterial and parallel streets with
landscaping located in a nonaccess reserve strip along the right-of-way line of
the arterial street;
      (3)   Corner lots that have extra width and are required to front on
local perpendicular streets; and/or
      (4)   Extra width for lots fronting on an arterial street and required to
share access drives with adjacent lots.
   (b)   Collector Streets. The arrangement, size, and location of collector
streets and their relationship to arterial and local streets shall be based on
the Comprehensive Plan. Collector streets shall be oriented to one or more
focal points of traffic generation and shall be planned for continuity and
interconnection with arterial streets or other collector streets. Other
collector street standards are set forth in the improvement standards.
   (c)   Local Streets. The primary function of local streets is to provide
direct access to lots and development. Local streets shall be designed to
minimize through traffic movement, but shall provide convenient access within
and between subdivisions. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins undeveloped
land, provision shall be made for the future interconnection of streets in a
logical street pattern. The local street pattern shall be related to topography
and natural features, as well as to the arrangement of blocks, lots, and
development. Traffic generators, such as schools and playgrounds, shall serve
as focal points in the pattern and there shall be a minimum number of
intersecting local streets. Local streets extended to the boundary of a
subdivision shall be coterminous with existing streets or be provided with a
temporary turn-around. Cul-de-sac streets shall be terminated with a permanent
turn-around and shall not exceed 800 feet in length. Other local street
standards are set forth in the improvement standards.
   (d)   Street Intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point
unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a
street shall coincide with an existing or proposed intersection on the opposite
side of such street. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an
intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall not be less than 150 feet.
      (3)   Except where no other alternative is practicable or legally
possible, no two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side
at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of
the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the
distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.
   (e)   Private Streets. Private streets may be permitted in an approved
planned residential development in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Section
1268.07(g).
   (f)   Temporary Turn-Arounds. Streets which are extended over 500 feet from
a street intersection to the boundary of a proposed subdivision which adjoins
undeveloped land shall be provided with a temporary turn-around. Turn-around
design standards are set forth in the improvement standards. Provision shall
also be made for the future extension of such streets and for the reversion of
any resulting excess right of way to abutting properties.
   (g)   Nonconforming Streets. Whenever undeveloped land abuts an existing
street which does not conform to the width required by these Subdivision
Regulations, or by County or State requirements, whichever width requirement is
greatest, the additional width shall be provided when such land is subdivided.
   (h)   Reserve Strips. A division of land to prevent access to, or the
extension of improvements to, another property, shall not be permitted, except
where the control and provision for disposal of such a division have been
assigned to the City.
   (i)   Access Drives. The centerline of access drives shall be located at
least sixty feet from the nearest intersection of right-of-way lines of the
nearest intersecting streets. Access drives along arterial streets shall be
spaced, insofar as possible, at intervals of not less than 200 feet.
   (j)   Street Names. All street names shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review and approval. Names shall be selected which will not
duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets in the City or
surrounding area. The following system shall be used whenever practical:
 
GENERAL DIRECTION LONG       SHORT
                  CONTINUOUS DISCONNECTED
North-south       Streets    Places
East-west         Avenues    Courts
Diagonal          Roads      Ways
Curving           Drives     Lanes, circles or trails
 
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1226.07 BLOCKS.
   The arrangement, size, and location of blocks shall be designed to conform
to topography and natural features, as well as to contemporary street planning
standards, and to accommodate lots, developments, and open spaces of a size and
character specified in the Comprehensive Plan or required by this Planning and
Zoning Code.
   (a)   Size. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated. In
residential subdivisions, block lengths should be designed to provide
convenient and safe traffic circulation. In long blocks, the Planning
Commission may require the reservation of an easement through the block to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. Generally,
the width of blocks should be planned to accommodate two tiers of lots. A
single tier of lots may, however, be required to separate a development from
arterial streets, adjoining developments, or open space.
   (b)   Coordinated Development. If the subdivision of a single parcel would
result in fractional or odd-shaped lots or lack of street frontage, or would
otherwise not conform to these Subdivision Regulations or this Planning and
Zoning Code, the developer may be required to submit a plan for adjoining
undeveloped or partially developed land to ensure eventual coordinated
development thereof. The City may adopt mapped street plans for such areas and
may require the reservation of rights of way.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1226.08 LOTS.
   Each lot shall be designed to form a functional site for the type of
development proposed, and its ancillary open space and lot lines shall not
merely be considered as a geometric shape enclosing minimum requirements.
Generally, lots shall be rectangular in shape. Triangular, elongated, or other
shapes that restrict the development or utilization of yards shall be avoided
where possible.
   (a)   Area and Width. The area and width of lots shall conform to the
regulations set forth in the Zoning Code. Such provisions, however, shall be
construed as minimum standards and not as optimum dimensions. Each lot shall
have frontage on a public street unless otherwise permitted by the Planning
Commission in a planned residential development.
   (b)   Depth. The depth of a lot shall not exceed three and one-half times
its width. This ratio may be increased when the rear lot line abuts an arterial
street, nonresidential development, or unusual topography or natural features.
   (c)   Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have extra width and depth to comply
with the required front, corner-side, side and rear yard requirements, and to
obtain appropriate orientation to both streets.
   (d)   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be designed to be at right angles
to front lot lines, or radial to curved front lot lines, whenever practical. In
the case of a T intersection, the lots that are directly opposite the
terminating street shall be designed so that the side lot lines are located
approximately on the projected centerline of the terminating street.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1226.09 PUBLIC PARKS AND PUBLIC OPEN SPACE.
   All residential subdivisions shall provide for public parks and public open
space in compliance with the requirements set forth in Chapter
1216.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1226.10 EASEMENTS.
   Easements shall be designed to implement the Comprehensive Plan and to
comply with the following standards:
   (a)   Pedestrian Ways. Pedestrian easements, when provided, shall be at
least twelve feet wide. Such easements shall be required across blocks or at
the end of cul-de- sac streets to provide access to business areas, schools,
open spaces, or other public facilities to which convenient pedestrian
circulation has not been provided by the street pattern. Landscaping,
sidewalks, fencing, and screening of pedestrian ways may be required by the
Planning Commission.
   (b)   Utility Easements. Where utilities are not located in a street right-
of-way, an easement at least fifteen feet wide, but preferably twenty feet
wide, shall be located on the center of rear lot lines, or on side lot lines
where necessary. Easements in a front yard may be approved by the Engineer and
the Planning Commission and shall not be more than ten feet wide.
   (c)   Drainage Ways. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage way,
channel, or stream, a drainage easement which includes such a watercourse shall
be provided. Such easement shall be at least twenty feet wide, or an additional
width determined by the City Engineer, so as to adequately contain the top of
the banks on either side, and shall provide adequate maintenance accessibility.
Insofar as possible, rear lot lines shall be planned along such drainage ways.
The area of a lot which is devoted to drainage easements shall not be included
in the calculation of the minimum lot area. Other drainage standards are set
forth in the improvement standards.
   (d)   Easement Layouts. Easement layouts shall conform with lot lines where
possible. On easements granted to the City, no structures or features of any
kind shall be constructed that may be damaged by or hinder normal City access
thereto or maintenance thereof, unless the City is held harmless for any
subsequent damage thereto by reason of the City's actions.

1232.01 PURPOSE.
   In order to accomplish the purposes for which this Zoning Code is adopted,
it is essential that its regulations be soundly and consistently applied, and
that this Code be vigorously administered. This chapter stipulates the
procedures to be followed in obtaining certificates of zoning compliance
(including conditional use certificates, development plan approval, and

      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1232.04 CONDITIONAL USE CERTIFICATES.
   (a)   Initial Application. When a proposed use, or an existing use for which
modification, enlargement, or alteration is proposed, is permitted in a zoning
district as a conditional use as set forth in the zoning district regulations,
a conditional use certificate is required and the application for such
conditional use certificate shall be submitted and reviewed according to the
following:
      (1)   Submission of Application. The owner, or agent thereof, of property
for which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Zoning
Administrator an application for a conditional use certificate. Such
application shall be accompanied by payment of the required fee established by
Council, a development plan and associated documentation as required in Section
1232.06(c) (when determined applicable by the Zoning Administrator), and the
following additional information:
         A.   The names and addresses of all property owners of record within
500 feet of the proposed development boundaries shall be submitted for public
hearing notification.
         B.   A preliminary market analysis indicating the number and type of
dwelling units, or the approximate square footage of office or commercial floor
area proposed. Such information shall be compared to like information for
existing uses of the same kind within the proposed market area or surrounding
communities.
         C.   A preliminary traffic analysis showing estimated traffic volumes
to be generated by the proposed use and the methods of handling such traffic,
including access points, signalizations, and other similar mechanisms for
traffic control.
         D.   A preliminary cost analysis indicating proposed construction
costs of public and private improvements, buildings, and landscaping.
         E.   When applicable, an overall conceptual plan for a proposed PRD or
MUPD, as set forth in Section
1232.05.
      (2)   Acceptance of Application. The Zoning Administrator shall review
the application for compliance with the submission requirements. After the
Zoning Administrator has determined the application includes all the required
information, the Zoning Administrator shall place the application on the agenda
of the Planning Commission's next regular meeting.
      (3)   Staff Review. After the application is determined complete, copies
shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission, the City Engineer, and the
City Planner.
      (4)   Planning Commission Review of Conditional Uses. During its review,
the Planning Commission may distribute the application to additional
appropriate administrative departments for review and comment. Administrative
review should be completed and any reports or comments submitted to the
Planning Commission prior to the time of the Commission's decision.
      (5)   Public Hearing and Notice by Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of such
public hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation
in the City at least once a week for at least two consecutive weeks, the last
of which shall occur at least one week before the date of said public hearing.
Written notice shall be given by first class mail, at least five days prior to
the date of the hearing, to each owner of record of property within 500 feet of
the boundaries of the proposed development. All notices shall set forth the
time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed conditional
use. Failure of delivery of a mailed notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
      (6)   Review Criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed
conditional use as presented on the submitted plans and specifications, review
and consider any staff reports, and ascertain whether or not the proposed use
will be consistent with the following conditions and criteria:
         A.   The proposed use will be consistent with the purpose and intent
of this Zoning Code and with the intent of the district in which it is located
and complies with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. In making such
a determination, the Planning Commission must find that both the general
criteria established for all conditional uses and the specific requirements
established for that particular use, as set forth in Chapter 1264, will be met
by the establishment and operation of the proposed use.
         B.   The Planning Commission shall, when applicable, review the
development plan for the proposed conditional use according to the development
plan review criteria set forth in Section
1232.06(h).
         C.   The Planning Commission may require such additional information
as the Commission deems necessary and may request the carrying out of special
studies and the provisions of expert advice.
      (7)   Action by Planning Commission. After reviewing the proposed
application and any of the various reports submitted as set forth in this
section, the Planning Commission shall, within sixty days from the date of the
Public Hearing, take one of the following actions:
         A.   If the proposed conditional use is found to be appropriate, the
Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use certificate. As part of
the approval, the Planning Commission may prescribe additional conditions,
stipulations, safeguards, and limitations on the duration or operation of the
use as it may deem necessary and in conformance with the intent and purposes of
this Code for the protection of nearby property and the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the community.
         B.   If the proposed use is found to be not in compliance with the
specifications of this Zoning Code, or not appropriate to or in keeping with
the purpose, policies, and intent of the Comprehensive Plan, the Planning
Commission shall recommend denial of the conditional use certificate.
   Failure of the Planning Commission to act within sixty days from the date
the application was filed, or within an extended period agreed upon with the
applicant, shall be deemed a denial of the conditional use application. With
the concurrence of the applicant, the Planning Commission may take such
additional time as may be necessary to further study the proposal and consider
modifications thereto.
      (8)   Issuance of Conditional Use Certificate. After approval by the
Planning Commission of a conditional use application, the Zoning Administrator
shall issue a conditional use certificate stating thereon the Commission action
and additional restrictions, if any, imposed on the application. A conditional
use certificate shall be deemed to authorize a particular conditional use on a
specific parcel for which it was approved.
      (9)   Time Limit on Construction. Approval of any conditional use shall
remain effective, provided that construction related to such use is commenced
within 12 months from the date of such approval by the Planning Commission.
      (10)   One Conditional Use Plan to be Effective. There shall not be more
than one conditional use plan relating to the same site in effect at any one
time.
   (b)   Revocation of Conditional Use Certificate. A conditional use
certificate may be revoked under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Discontinuance. If the conditional use is discontinued for six
consecutive months, it shall not be reinstated without action by the Planning
Commission pursuant to the review procedures of this section.
      (2)   Noncompliance. The breach of any condition, safeguard, or
requirement, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, shall automatically
invalidate the conditional use certificate granted.
   (c)   Reapplication. An application for a conditional use certificate which
has been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission and is resubmitted
to the Planning Commission shall comply with all the requirements of this
section, including payment of the required fee. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (d)   Alteration or Change of An Existing or Previously Approved Conditional
Use. A new conditional use certificate shall be obtained for any change that
proposes to alter, reconstruct, or otherwise modify a use or site in any one of
the following ways:
      (1)   Expanding the floor area of the permitted use;
      (2)   Increasing the number of dwelling units in a residential
development project;
      (3)   Changing the use in such a way that requires an increase in the
amount of parking spaces;
      (4)   Changing the site’s vehicular or pedestrian circulation system;
      (5)   Any change that, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, would
alter compliance with the general criteria for conditional uses as stated in
 1264.02.
   If an application under this requirement is not approved, the original
conditional use certificate shall continue to be valid under the prior
conditions. The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for a public
hearing set forth in
1232.04(a)(5) if it deems the proposed modifications to be of minor impact.
   (e)   Appeals to Council. Any person, including, but not limited to, the
applicant or an affected property owner, who is aggrieved by an action of the
Planning Commission in approving or denying an application for a conditional
use permit may, within thirty days after such approval or denial is rendered,
appeal to Council. After reviewing the action of the Planning Commission,
Council may reverse or modify the decision by an ordinance approved by a two-
thirds majority vote of its membership. If Council does not take action to
reverse or modify the action of the Planning Commission within thirty days
after an appeal is filed, the action of the Planning Commission shall be deemed
to have been ratified. (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1232.05 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES.
   Both Planned Residential Developments (PRD) and Mixed Use Traditional
Neighborhood Developments (MUTND) are conditionally permitted uses and their
approval as a conditional use shall follow the administrative provisions
(including the deposit of fees) set forth in Section
1232.04(a) for conditional uses. In addition PRDs and MUTNDs require the
submission and approval of an overall conceptual plan:
   (a)   Overall Conceptual Plan: Following preliminary discussions by the
applicant with the Planning Commission, an overall Conceptual Plan shall be
submitted formally for the entire tract of land proposed to be developed as a
PRD or MUTND. The overall Conceptual Plan, in addition to the requirements of
Section
1232.04(a)(1)A. through
1232.04(a)(1)D. shall clearly indicate the following:
      (1)   Topography, at ten-foot intervals;
      (2)   Location, type and general arrangement of residential uses,
indicating the acreage and proposed density for each area;
      (3)   Location, type and general arrangement of nonresidential uses,
indicating the acreage for each area and proposed square footage for each
building;
      (4)   Area(s) to be set aside to meet the common open space requirement;
including the natural area corridor required for a MUTND;
      (5)   Vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems;

      (8)   Initial overall Tree Preservation and Management Plan.
   (b)   Public Hearing. Prior to granting approval of an overall Conceptual
Plan as a PRD or MUTND conditional use, the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing following the notification requirements and procedures required
for conditional uses in Section
1232.04(a)(5).
   (c)   Effect of Overall Conceptual Plan Approval. Once the overall
Conceptual Plan is reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission as
described above and according to the conditional use procedures set forth in
Sections
1232.04(a)(1) through
1232.04(a)(6), it will become the approved Master Development Plan. Subsequent
approval of the preliminary development plan and the final development plan
shall comply with the procedures for development plan review set forth in
Section
1232.06.
   (d)   Project Developed in Phases. If the project is to be developed in
phases, each phase shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the
procedures for development plan review set forth in Section
1232.06. If, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, any phase differs
significantly from the approved Master Development Plan or results in an
alteration of the Master Development Plan, the Planning Commission shall
approve a revised Master Development Plan, and may, depending on the
significance of the proposed changes, require a public hearing prior to
approving the revised Master Development Plan and the specific phase. This
public hearing, if required, shall follow the procedures described in Section
1232.04(a)(5) and shall occur prior to approval of the preliminary development
plan for the phase. (Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28- 16.)

Code and any other applicable City ordinance;
         B.   Represents a detailed and precise expansion of the preliminary
development plan, as previously approved; and
         C.   Complies with all conditions, which may have been imposed at the
time of the approval of the preliminary development plan.
      (8)   Decision on application.  If it is found that the final development
plan complies in all respects to this section, the Commission shall approve
such final development plan. The Chairperson of the Commission shall affix his
or her signature and the date of the adoption of such plan to the plan
document, attesting to such approval. The approval of the final development
plan shall be documented in the following three places: in the minutes of the
Commission; on an appropriate City form that shows the signature (dated) of the
officials and/or commissions that provided review and approvals for the
Commission; and on the velum of the plan, if appropriate. The Chairperson of
the Commission and/or the Commission Secretary shall sign such forms.
   (l)   Performance and Maintenance Bonds. The developer shall post a
performance and maintenance bond(s) for the site development portion of a
project. The form of the bond(s) shall be as approved by the Law Director. The
amount and terms of such bond(s) shall be as specified by the City Engineer.
   (m)   Combined Preliminary and Final Development Plans. An applicant may
request a waiver of the preliminary development plan. If, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, such a waiver would not affect the efficient processing of
such plan, it may approve such request. The single final development plan,
however, is subject to all requirements and review procedures set forth for
both preliminary and final development plans.
   (n)   Certificate Issued. Upon approval of the final development plan by the
Planning Commission, the Building Department shall issue a certificate of
zoning compliance.
   (o)   Significance of an Approved Final Development Plan.  An approved final
development plan shall become for the proposed development a binding commitment
of the specific elements approved for development. The approved final
development plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or group of
individuals or corporations prior to the issuance of a building permit. All
construction and development under any building permit shall be in accordance
with the approved plan. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for
revocation of the zoning certificate.
   (p)   Final Development Plan Revisions. Any changes in an approved final
development plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance with this
section. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the
zoning certificate.
   (q)   Lapse of Approval.  An approved final development plan shall remain
valid for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of its
approval or for a period so specified by the Planning Commission. If at the end
of that time construction has not begun, then such plan shall be considered as
having lapsed and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and reapproved by
the Planning Commission. Construction is deemed to have begun when all
necessary excavation and piers or footings of one or more principal buildings
included in the plan shall have been completed.
      (Ord. 54-2016. Passed 2-28-17.)
1232.065 AMENDMENT OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   No development agreement or other agreement between the developer and the
City, that is made a condition of development approval by the Planning
Commission, shall be substantially amended without additional hearings and
public notice like those required for the consideration and approval of the
original agreement.
(Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1232.07 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Planning and Zoning Commission may be taken by any person,
firm, or corporation, or by any officer, board, or department of the City,
deeming himself, herself or itself to be adversely affected by the decision of
any official administering or enforcing the regulations in this Zoning Code.
   (a)   Filing. Notice of appeal shall be filed in the office of the Zoning
Administrator within thirty days after the date of any adverse order,
requirement, decision, or determination. Such written notice of appeal shall
specify therein the grounds and reasons for the appeal and shall be accompanied
by all necessary plans, documents, or other descriptive material pertinent to
the case. Upon the filing, such notice of appeal shall be transmitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission at its next meeting.
   (b)   Notice of Public Hearing. When a notice of appeal has been filed in
proper form with the Commission, the Secretary of the Commission shall set the
date for a public hearing of such appeal. Notice of such hearing shall be given
to property owners within 500 feet of the boundaries of the tract or lot under
appeal, by first-class mail, at least five days prior to such hearing. Notices
shall state the time, place, and object of the hearing. All notices shall be
sent to addresses given in the application; otherwise to the addresses given in
the last assessment roll.
   (c)   Public Hearing. The appellant may be represented in person or by his
or her agent at the hearing. A report of the facts in the case shall be
presented by the Zoning Administrator. Any resident or property owner affected
or potentially affected by the appeal shall be given the opportunity to be
heard. The Commission shall make a determination on such appeal within a
reasonable period of time according to the criteria specified in this section.
   (d)   Recess of Hearing. The Commission may recess such hearings in order to
permit additional information to be presented, or to cause further notice to be
given to other property owners likely to be affected by such appeal. If the
time and place of the continued hearing is publicly announced at the time of
adjournment, no further notice shall be required.
   (e)   Stay of Proceedings. Once an appeal is filed concerning any type of
action being undertaken, such action shall be stopped and shall not be
continued until further directed by a decision of the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   (f)   Decision of the Commission. Within its powers, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the requirement
to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom
the appeal is taken. The Commission shall render a decision on the appeal
without unreasonable delay. If the Commission fails to act within sixty days
from the date the appeal was filed, or an extended period of time as may be
agreed upon, the appellant may assume the appeal has been denied.
   (g)   Notification of Commission’s Decision. A certified copy of the
Commission’s decision shall be transmitted to the appellant, the Zoning
Administrator, and the Clerk of Council within three days after the Commission
makes its decision. Such decision shall be binding on the Zoning Administrator.
For applications that are approved, the Zoning Administrator shall incorporate
any conditions attached by the Commission into the certificate to be issued. No
decision of the Commission shall become final until thirty days from the date
such decision is transmitted to the appellant, unless the Commission finds that
the immediate effectuation of such decision is necessary for the protection of
the public health, safety, and general welfare, and the Commission shall so
certify on the record.
   (h)   Appeals to Council. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the
Planning and Zoning Commission may, within thirty days after such decision is
rendered, appeal to Council. After reviewing the Commission’s decision, Council
may reverse or modify the decision by an ordinance approved by a two-thirds
majority vote of its membership.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14- 97; Ord. 63-2019. Passed 9-10-19; Ord. 25- 2021.
Passed 4-13-21.)
1232.08 VARIANCES.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize upon appeal in specific
cases such variance from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary
to the public interest according to the following procedures:
   (a)   Application Requirements. An application for a variance shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator for review by the Planning and Zoning Commission
upon the forms provided, and shall be accompanied by the following requirements
necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested variance:
      (1)   The name, address, and phone number of applicant(s), and the names
and addresses of all property owners within 500 feet of the boundaries of the
tract or lot under appeal;
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest, or written authority;
      (3)   A description of the property or portion thereof;
      (4)   A description or nature of the variance requested;
      (5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) below;
      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, elevations, and other drawings at a
reasonable scale to convey the need for the variance;
      (7)   Payment of the application fee as established by Council; and
      (8)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
   Upon receipt of a written request for a variance, the Zoning Administrator
shall, within a reasonable amount of time, make a preliminary review of the
request to determine whether such application provides the information
necessary for review and evaluation. If it is determined that such application
does not provide the information necessary for such review and evaluation, the
Zoning Administrator shall so advise the applicant of the deficiencies and
shall not further process the application until the deficiency is corrected.
   (b)   Public Hearing by the Commission. According to the procedures
established for appeals in Section
1232.07, the Commission shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the
same.
   (c)   Criteria and Findings for Granting of Variances. The Commission may
authorize variances from the literal or exact enforcement of the requirements
and specification of this Zoning Code, in accordance with the following
criteria. There are two categories of variances: those relating to use and
those relating to area requirements.
      (1)   Use variances. In the case of a variance for use, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may authorize a variance if it determines that the variance
will result in no substantial detriment to any surrounding property, that the
intent and purpose of this Zoning Code are not impaired, and when one or more
of the following apply:
         A.   Unnecessary hardship. Where the literal interpretation of this
Zoning Code would result in unnecessary hardships peculiar to the property
involved and not based on conditions created by the owner, the Commission may
grant relief therefrom. For purposes of this paragraph, the limiting of
possibilities of economic advantage do not constitute unnecessary hardship.
         B.   Exceptional circumstances. Where there are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question
that do not apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in the same
zoning district. If there is a general or recurrent condition or situation, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may determine that there be a general rule or
regulation for such situation.
      (2)   Variances relating to specific area requirements. For the purpose
of this Zoning Code, an area variance shall include any variance related to a
numerical requirement governing building setbacks, building height, yards,
signs, parking, landscaping, and other similar standards regulating the bulk of
buildings and structures. An area variance shall not include an increase in the
maximum density. The Commission shall review each application for an area
variance to determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of this Code
and shall review the evidence to determine if such demonstrates that the
literal enforcement of this Code will result in the following:
         A.   Practical difficulty. The factors to be considered and weighed by
the Commission in determining practical difficulty include (but are not limited
to) the following:
            1.     Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge (or would be expected to have known) of the zoning restriction. And
whether the special circumstances noted by the applicant exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
            2.     Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return under the strict interpretation of this Zoning Code;
            3.     Whether there can be any beneficial use of the property
without the variance;
            4.     Whether the property owner's predicament can be obviated
through some method other than granting the variance;
            5.     Whether the variance is substantial;
            6.     Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered as a result of the variance; or
            7.     Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup.
         B.   Cumulative Effect. The Commission shall consider what the
cumulative effect would be if all lots with the same situation as the applicant
for the variance were to be granted the requested variance.
         C.   No detrimental effects. The Commission must find that there will
be no substantial detriment to any surrounding property and that the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Code are not impaired.
   (d)   Conditions. The Commission may attach conditions regarding the
location, character, or size of a structure or the location, character, size,
or hours of operation of a use, prior to granting a variance, as it deems
necessary for the public interest.
   (e)   Guarantees. In granting a variance, the Commission may require a
guarantee or a performance bond to ensure that such variance or attached
conditions are and will be complied with.
   (f)   Action by the Commission. The Commission shall either approve, approve
with supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (e) hereof, or
disapprove the request for a variance. The Commission shall further provide a
statement in writing describing the criteria, findings, and/or issues of
“unnecessary hardship” or “practical difficulty” pursuant to subsection (c)
hereof that justify the granting or denial of the variance.
   (g)   Term and Extension of Variance. Variances shall not be assignable and
shall expire twelve months from the date of their enactment or at a time
specified as a condition of the variance, unless prior thereto, the applicant
commences actual construction in accordance with the granted variance. There
shall be no modification of variances except by further consideration of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Requests for renewal of expired variances shall
be considered to be the same as an application for a variance and shall meet
all requirements for application and review pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14- 97; Ord. 63-2019. Passed 9-10-19; Ord. 25- 2021.
Passed 4-13-21.)
1232.09 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in this
Zoning Code, the Planning and Zoning Commission may make a determination that
the proposed use is of the same general character as the uses permitted in the
district in which the use is proposed, or is similar to a particular use
permitted in the district in which the use is proposed, and is determined to be
consistent with the purpose statement for the district in which such use is
proposed. Such additional uses shall not include those uses which are permitted
or prohibited in any other district, or which, in the judgment of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, would likely be objectionable in the district in which
such use is proposed. If the Commission determines that a use is substantially
similar to a specific use listed in this Code, the substantially similar use
may be permitted in those districts which allow the principal or conditional
use that is most similar. The initial determination of a similar use shall be
approved in accordance with the conditional use procedures set forth in Section
1232.04, including the requirement for a public hearing. Following such a
determination, the similar use shall be considered to be added to the permitted
use list for the district, either as a permitted principal use or as a
conditional use, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 63- 2019. Passed 9-10-19.)
1232.10 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   Land shall not be occupied or used and a building which has been erected or
altered shall not be reoccupied or the use of such building changed until a
certificate of occupancy has been applied for and issued as follows:
   (a)   Certificate of Occupancy Required.
      (1)   Occupancy of a building. A certificate of occupancy shall be
required before occupancy of a building which has been constructed, or before
occupancy of an existing building which has been altered, moved, changed in
use, or changed as to off-street parking or loading requirements. The
certificate of occupancy shall only be issued after the completion of the
erection or alteration of such building, and after such building is found, upon
inspection, to be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Occupancy of land. A certificate of occupancy shall be required
before occupancy of land or where the use of land has been changed to a use
different than the prior use. A certificate of occupancy shall be issued when
it has been found, by inspection, that the use is in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Change in use of nonconforming building or use. A certificate of
occupancy shall be required whenever a nonconforming building or land is
changed, and shall not be issued until the Planning Commission has approved the
change in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1280.
   (b)   Record of Certificates Issued. A record of all applications and
certificates of occupancy issued shall be kept on file in the office of the
Zoning Administrator and copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any person
having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the land or building affected.

1234.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish zoning districts in order to
realize the general purpose set forth in this Zoning Code, to provide for
orderly growth and development, and to protect the property rights of all
individuals by assuring the compatibility of uses and practices within
districts.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
   To carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code, the entire land and
water area of the City is hereby divided into five categories and thirteen
district classifications, as follows:
Category     District Classification
Residential  D-1      Single-Family Attached Dwelling District
             D-2      Single-Family Dwelling District
             D-3      Single-Family Dwelling District
             D-4      Single-Family Attached Dwelling District

Industrial   I-1      Administrative Offices, Industrial Research and Special
                      Nonmanufacturing District
             I-2      Industrial Manufacturing District
 
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.03 SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   General. Where appropriate, supplemental districts may be established
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Zoning Code. Any such
supplemental district shall be considered an additional land use restriction
and/or provision to be enforced over and above the standard zoning district or
districts upon which it may be superimposed. Supplemental districts may be
established according to the following classifications:
 
Category District Classification
Historic (H)      Historic Area Conservation District
 
   (b)   Designations. Any part of a standard zoning district, which is
superimposed by a supplemental district, shall be designated by the standard
district classification followed by a supplemental district designation in
parenthesis, such as D-3 (H).
   (c)   Zoning Map. All supplemental district boundaries shall be shown on the
Official Zoning Map.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.04 ZONING OF ANNEXED AREAS AND AREAS NOT INCLUDED IN DISTRICTS.
   In any case where property has not been included within a district, such
property shall be considered to be in the D-1 Suburban Dwelling District until
otherwise classified. Any property which is hereafter annexed to the City shall
retain the zoning classification which it bore prior to such annexation, until
the Council either adopts such existing classification, or by ordinance, places
such property in a classification specified in this chapter. For 180 days
following the annexation, no zoning certificates shall be issued and no
development shall be permitted, except for development according to a valid
permit issued prior to the annexation, unless such property is zoned to a
classification specified in this chapter prior to the expiration of the 180
days.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.05 ADOPTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the districts established in Section
1234.02 are hereby established and shown on the Official Zoning Map, which,
together with all explanatory notations and references thereon, is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Zoning Code, thereby
having the same force and effect as if herein fully described in writing. The
map is entitled Zoning Map of the City of Olmsted Falls and, with all its
future additions, amendments, changes, and supplements, designates the area
assigned to the respective use districts and their boundaries.
   (b)   The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signatures of the
Chairperson and Secretary of the Planning Commission and the Mayor of the City.
Such Map shall be attested to by the Clerk of Council and shall bear the seal
of the City under the words: "This is to certify that this is the Official
Zoning Map referred to in Section
1234.05(a) of Ordinance Number 44-75 of the City of Olmsted Falls, State of
Ohio," together with the date of the adoption of said Ordinance.
   (c)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning
Map which may, from time to time, be published, the Official Zoning Map, which
shall be located in the facilities of the Zoning Administrator, shall be the
final authority as to the current zoning status of land in the City.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.06 AMENDMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   If, in accordance with this Zoning Code, changes are made in district
boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, the Zoning
Administrator shall cause such changes to be made on such Map promptly after an
amendment has been adopted by Council. No change of any nature shall be made on
the Map, except in conformity with this section. A notation shall be made on
the Map as to the date and ordinance number of such amendment.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.07 REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to
interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, Council may
adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the previous Map. Such
new Map may correct drafting errors or other omissions and may add new lots or
subdivisions, but it shall not have the effect of amending original Ordinance
44-75, passed May 11, 1976, or any subsequent amendments thereto. The new Map
shall be identified by the same officers as the prior Map and shall bear the
seal of the City under the words: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning
Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption
of original Map) as part of Ordinance No.44-75 of the City of Olmsted Falls,
State of Ohio.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1234.08 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of zoning districts shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Streets and Roads. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of highways, streets, roads, or railroad lines, shall be construed
to follow such centerlines.
   (b)   Lot Lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot
lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (c)   City Limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following City
limits shall be construed as following such City limits.
   (d)   Creeks or Streams. Boundaries indicated as approximately following
centerlines of creeks, streams, or other such bodies of water shall be
construed as following such centerlines. If such watercourses change location,
the boundary line shall be construed as changing therewith.
   (e)   Extensions of Other Features. Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or
extensions of, features indicated in subsections (a) through (d) hereof, shall
be construed as being parallel thereto or an extension thereof, and at such
distance therefrom as indicated on the Official Zoning Map of the City of
Olmsted Falls. Distances not specifically indicated on the Map shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Map.
   (f)   Discrepancies.  Where physical or cultural features existing on the
ground are at variance with those shown on the Map or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections (a) through (e) hereof, the Planning Commission
shall interpret district boundaries. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)

1240.01 PURPOSE.
   The dwelling districts set forth in this Zoning Code are established to
accomplish the general purpose of this Planning and Zoning Code as stated in
Chapter
1202, and to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)   To regulate the density and distribution of population in accordance
with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, to avoid congestion, and to
maintain adequate services;
   (b)   To preserve and enhance those elements of the natural environment that
give Olmsted Falls its essential character;
   (c)   To protect the desirable characteristics of existing residential
development, to promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land, and
to bring about the eventual conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and other
plans of the City;
   (d)   To establish the D-1 Suburban Dwelling District to promote the most
desirable and beneficial use of land in suburban and semirural areas of the
City. The minimum lot size of one acre is intended to preserve the natural
environment of the areas where this district is applied.
   (e)   To establish the D-2 Single-Family Dwelling District to provide low
density single- family residential uses, with a minimum lot size of 20,000
square feet;
   (f)   To establish the D-3 Single-Family Dwelling District to provide
single-family detached dwellings, with a minimum lot size of 12,000 square
feet;
   (g)   To establish the D-4 Single-Family Attached Dwelling District to
provide single- family detached and single-family attached dwellings in
suitable locations at a density of 4.8 units per acre, as set forth in Section
1240.04;
   (h)   To establish the D-5 Multi-Family Dwelling District to provide for
multi-family dwellings, with ample open space and parking, in areas with
sanitary sewer and water distribution facilities and where the thoroughfare
pattern and street pavement construction will accommodate such uses; and
   (i)   To encourage flexible planned residential development, as a
conditional use in appropriate areas of the City, which promotes creative and
efficient use of land in a unified development.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1240.02 PERMITTED USES.
   In the D Dwelling Districts, land shall be used or occupied, and structures
shall be erected, reconstructed, enlarged, moved, or structurally altered only
in accordance with the schedules and use regulations of this Zoning Code.
   (a)   Principal Uses.
      (1)   Permitted by right: The principal uses, buildings, and structures
listed in Section
1240.03 and designated with a P are permitted by right in the districts
indicated, provided that all requirements of other City ordinances and this
Zoning Code have been met.
      (2)   Permitted as conditional uses: The principal uses, buildings, and
structures listed in Section
1240.03 and designated with a C, may be permitted in the districts indicated,
provided they conform to the conditions, standards, and requirements of Chapter
1264, and are approved for a particular zoning lot in accordance with the
administrative procedures of Section
1232.04.
      (3)   Not permitted: A principal use, building, or structure listed in
Section
1240.03 that is not designated with either a P or a C for a particular district

1240.11 DAY-CARE HOMES.
   This Zoning Code recognizes that the availability of safe and affordable,
good-quality child day-care is important to the well-being of parents and
children in the City. Furthermore, it is the purpose of this section to
regulate the operation of child day-care homes in a manner that preserves the
residential character of neighborhoods.
   (a)   Type B Day-Care Home. A Type-B day-care home is a permanent residence
of the provider where child care is provided for one to six children and where
no more than three children are under two years of age. For the purposes of
this definition, any children under six years of age who are related to the
provider and who are on the premises of the day-care home shall be counted.
Type-B child day-care homes are a permitted accessory use in residential
districts, and do not require a zoning certificate.
   (b)   Type A Day-Care Home. A Type A day-care home is a permanent residence
of the provider where child care is provided for seven to twelve children, or
four to twelve children, if four or more of them are under two years of age.
For the purposes of this definition, any children under six years of age who

establishment of any Type A day-care home.
         (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1240.12 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations which control the
establishment and operation of home occupations. The intent of these
regulations is to allow limited business use of a residential dwelling unit in
such a manner that the nonresidential use is limited to an accessory use, and
does not in any way whatsoever disrupt or alter the residential character of
the neighborhood in which it is located. Compliance with these regulations
should result in all home occupations being located and conducted in such a
manner that their existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside
the dwelling unit.
Type A Home Occupation means a home occupation as an accessory use in which the
home is used by those residing therein as a place of work and no customers or
non-resident employee comes to the home.
Type B Home Occupation means a home occupation as an accessory use in which the
home is used by those residing therein as a place of work and in which
customers and/or not more than one (1) non-resident employee come to the home.
   (a)   All home occupations shall comply with the following:
      (1)   The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary in
importance of the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.
      (2)   A home occupation, wherever conducted, shall not occupy more than
an area equal to fifteen percent of the living area of the dwelling unit.
      (3)   Any activity, material, goods, or equipment indicative of the home
occupation shall be carried on, utilized, or stored within the dwelling unit
and shall not be visible from any public way or adjacent property.
      (4)   The home occupation shall not create a nuisance by generating any
noise, odor, dust, vibrations, fumes, smoke, or electromagnetic interference
that is transmitted outside the dwelling unit.
      (5)   The home occupation shall not necessitate any structural
alteration, or any alteration to any elevation of the structure, or the
installation of additional parking surfaces. There shall not be any change in
the outside appearance of the building or premises as a result of the home
occupation.
      (6)   The home occupation shall not interfere with the off-street parking
required for the principal use pursuant to Chapter 1270.
      (7)   The home occupation shall not necessitate any variance to the
Building Code.
      (8)   The home occupation shall not constitute a fire hazard. There shall
be no storage of hazardous, combustible, or flammable matter, no accumulation
of rubbish or waste paper, and no storage of cartons and/or boxes situated in a
manner that would endanger life or property in case of an actual fire.
      (9)   Operation of the home occupation shall not cause an increase in the
use of public utilities (water, sewer, electric, sanitation, etc.) such that
the combined use of the public utilities by the residence and the home
occupation interferes with the use of such public utilities by neighboring
properties.
      (10)   Goods shall not be displayed to or picked up by the customer at
the site of the home occupation.
      (11)   The number of automobiles or trucks attracted to the premise shall
not be greater than that is normally associated with residential uses,
including formal fluctuations in the level of residential traffic.
   (b)   Type B Home Occupations, in addition to complying with the regulations
in (a) above, must be granted a conditional use permit pursuant to subsection
1264.05(v).

a wide range of commercial uses targeted to motorists, in select areas in such
a way as not to encroach upon residential areas;

1258.01 PURPOSE.
   The I Industrial Districts set forth in this Zoning Code are established to
accomplish the general purpose of this Planning and Zoning Code as stated in
Chapter
1202, and to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)   To establish I-1 Administrative Office, Industrial Research, and
Special Non- manufacturing District so as to accommodate and encourage the
grouping of professional, research, administrative, and light industrial uses
which are usually controlled operations. It is intended that permitted uses are
uses that operate with a minimum of smoke, noise, odor, dust, glare, vibration,
air and water pollution, or fire and safety hazard, and that are not considered
likely to cause a nuisance. Uses permitted in the I-1 District are expected to
have operational and physical characteristics that do not detrimentally affect
surrounding zoning districts and all aspects of these uses are to be conducted
within enclosed structures.
   (b)   To establish the I-2 Industrial Manufacturing District so as to
provide for those industrial and manufacturing uses which may utilize products,
materials, and/or processes that create smoke, noise, odor, dust, fumes, glare,
or other objectionable characteristics, but the impacts of which are controlled
in compliance with permitted uses, performance standards, and setback and
screening requirements. In order to ensure that the objectives of this district
are achieved, outdoor activities, including storage, are permitted only as a
conditional use.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
   (c)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land and to
bring about eventual conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and other plans of
the City.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (d)   To establish reasonable and uniform regulations to minimize and
control the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses within
the City in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of
the City of Olmsted Falls. Nevertheless, the provisions herein do not have the
purpose of intent of imposing unreasonable limitations or restrictions on the
content of any communicative materials or any communication, including adult
entertainment businesses. Similarly, it is not the purpose or intent of this
Zoning Ordinance to restrict or deny adults access to adult entertainment
businesses protected by the First Amendment, or to deny distributors and
exhibitors of adult entertainment businesses access to their intended market.
Furthermore, it is not the intent of this regulation to condone or legitimize
the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene. (Ord. 75-2005.
Passed 10-11-05.)

1260.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish provisions for
Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood Districts subject to the regulations and
procedures contained herein and in conformance with the provisions of Part
Twelve of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Olmsted Falls in order:
      (1)   To encourage economic development that is compatible with the
existing character of Olmsted Falls.
      (2)   To encourage, in select areas, a mixture of uses including offices,
limited retail, and higher density residential in a manner that reinforces the
present small-town, mixed-use environment.
      (3)   To encourage creative, high quality site design practices in the
development of residential areas.
      (4)   To utilize the unique environment between Plum Creek, Minnie Creek
and the West Branch of the Rocky River along Columbia Road according to the
policies established in the Comprehensive Plan.
      (5)   To create neighborhoods which are pedestrian oriented and which are
focused on walkability and green spaces but still accommodate vehicular access.
      (6)   To promote safe and efficient pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular
movement.
      (7)   To preserve an open space corridor along Plum Creek, Minnie Creek
and along the West Branch of the Rocky River and ensure that natural resources,
including views of the River and Creek, will be preserved.
      (8)   To ensure that development occurs in a unified manner in accordance
with a development plan.
 
   (b)   Intent. The regulations contained herein are intended to permit the
creation of higher density residential neighborhoods that combine larger scale
residential development in coordination with nonresidential uses in a manner
that has a pedestrian rather than a vehicular orientation and that complements
the existing features, image and character of Olmsted Falls. It is further
intended that architectural treatment within Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood
Districts be of high qualify and be designed with characteristics compatible to
Olmsted Falls that will enhance the established characteristics of the
community and downtown area. Finally, it is intended that Mixed Use Traditional
Neighborhood Districts provide bike and pedestrian ways that provide enhanced
connectivity with other neighborhoods and the downtown.
(Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)
 
1260.02 MINIMUM PROJECT AREA AND OWNERSHIP.
   The following criteria must be met in order to create a Mixed Use
Traditional Neighborhood District:
   (a)   Each Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood District shall have a minimum
area of not less than fifteen (15) contiguous acres. However, the Planning
Commission may waive these standards when they determine that, because of
unique circumstances, these minimum standards cannot be achieved and the
development of the property at the lesser standard will not have any material
adverse impact on the adjacent property or the City, provided that in no case
shall the area of the Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood District be less than
five (5) acres. Unique circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   The proposed MUTND is adjacent to and thus becomes an extension of
an existing or separately proposed MUTND; or
      (2)   Because of existing uses, natural features, or ownership patterns
there is no, or little, likelihood that contiguous land area can be acquired
and consolidated to achieve the requisite fifteen (15) contiguous areas.
   (b)   At time of establishment, each Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood
District shall be owned, leased or controlled either by a single person or
corporation, or by a group of individuals or corporations, provided that an
application must be filed by the owner or jointly by owners of all property
included in the project area. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved
final development plan and related conditions, including the phasing of
development, shall be binding on all owners.
      (Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)

1260.06 COMMON AREAS AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   In a MUTND District, all proposed development shall comply with the
following open space requirements:
   (a)   Special Natural Area Corridors. The banks of Plum Creek, Minnie Creek
and the West Branch of the Rocky River shall be preserved and available to the
general public pursuant to the terms and restrictions of this section and shall
comply with the following:
      (1)   The natural area corridor shall extend along the entire waterway

within the corridor area or adjacent thereto as determined by the Planning
Commission. Each replacement tree shall have a minimum caliper of two and one-
half (2.5) inches.
      (4)   If there is any uncertainty as to the exact location of the edge of
the waterway, the location of the water’s edge, for the purposes of
establishing the limits of the natural area corridor, shall be determined by
the Planning Commission.
      (5)   When a standard single-family subdivision is developed separately

      (Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)
 
1260.07 DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   A Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood Development approved as a conditional
use shall comply with the following development design standards.
   (a)   Residential Density. The maximum density of areas devoted to
residential uses shall not exceed seven (7) dwelling units per acre, provided
however, that age restricted senior residences and assisted living facilities

that such adjustment is necessary due to the existence of unique circumstances
and in order to achieve the goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Minimum Building Setbacks from Project Boundaries. Where a building
abuts any MUTND project boundary line, the minimum setback shall be twenty-five
feet when adjacent to a P, C or I District and twenty-five feet plus one foot
of additional setback for every two feet of building height greater than
twenty-five (25) feet when adjacent to a D Dwelling District. In no case,
however, shall the required setback exceed 100 feet.
   (d)   Building Setbacks From Streets. Buildings shall be set back a minimum
of five (5) feet and a maximum of twenty-five (25) feet from any public street
right-of-way or private street easement. In no case shall a front facing garage
door of any residential dwelling be located closer than twenty-five (25) feet
from any street right-of-way or easement.
   (e)   Minimum Separation Between Buildings. In order to ensure reasonable
privacy and separation of buildings, individual buildings located within the
MUTND shall be separated by the minimum distances specified below:
      (1)   Single-family detached dwelling units shall be separated from each
other by a minimum of ten (10) feet.
      (2)   Single-family detached dwelling units shall be a minimum of thirty
(30) feet from attached single-family dwellings.
      (3)   Single-family detached dwelling units shall be a minimum of forty
(40) feet from all other habitable buildings.
      (4)   The minimum separation between attached single-family dwellings,
multi-family dwellings, and nonresidential buildings shall be twenty- five (25)
feet provided however, that this separation shall not apply to mixed-use work-
live buildings with commercial or office uses on the first floor and
residential dwellings above.
   (f)   Building Height. The maximum height of any single-family building
shall be thirty-five (35) feet and the maximum height of multi-family and non-
residential buildings shall be three (3) stories and forty-five (45) feet,
unless a greater height is specifically authorized by the Planning Commission.
   (g)   Parking Setbacks. Off-street parking areas and roadways must be
screened according to Section
 1274.01 and shall comply with the following setback requirements:
      (1)   All off-street parking areas shall be set back from an existing or
proposed public right-of-way a distance not less than ten (10) feet.
      (2)   All off-street parking areas and roadways shall be set back from
all other boundaries of the MUTND not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
   (h)   Architectural Treatment. Architectural treatments shall be as approved
and authorized by the Planning Commission and shall demonstrate a cohesive
design concept, which promotes compatibility among structures while
incorporating a diversity of materials, styles, and features conducive to an
attractive and desirable residential environment. The architectural design of
all buildings and structures shall be of high quality and shall make use of
materials generally regarded as premium quality. Buildings shall be designed to
preserve and enhance the character of Olmsted Falls and be appropriate and
compatible with the surroundings of the Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood
Development. Building designs need not be historical in character, but shall be
compatible with the established character of the City. At a minimum,
architectural treatments shall comply with the following criteria:
      (1)   Architectural features, materials, and the articulation of building
facades shall be continued on all sides visible from a public street or
courtyard.
      (2)   Front facades of dwellings shall face onto a public street or
courtyard, but shall not be oriented to face directly onto a parking lot.
      (3)   Porches, roof overhangs, hooded doorways, or similar architectural
elements shall define the front entrance to all residences.
      (4)   A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the ground floor front facade
of commercial buildings shall be transparent, consisting of window or door
openings.
      (5)   Front facing residential garages shall be set back at least five
(5) feet behind the front wall and/or front entrance of the dwelling.
      (6)   All residential buildings shall have twenty-five percent (25%)
masonry veneer on the front facade except where this requirement is
specifically waived and an alternative facade treatment is approved by the
Planning Commission.
   (i)   Access and Connectivity. Streets and alleys shall be designed to
permit adequate access by emergency vehicles, promote the safety of motorist
and pedestrians, minimize traffic conflicts and congestion, and promote the
safe, efficient flow of vehicular traffic. Sidewalks and pathways shall provide
connectivity within the development, with adjacent properties, and with
downtown. The vehicular circulation system shall be designed to assure that the
entire area (as shown on the Comprehensive Plan) is a cohesive development, and
to promote inter-connection among individual projects. Internal circulation
that isolates a project shall be discouraged. Streets and walkways shall be
extended and stubbed to adjoining properties to allow for future extensions.
The specific manner of termination of streets and pathways shall be as
determined and approved by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may
consider private streets pursuant to Section
1268.07(g).
   (j)   Ownership. Any ownership arrangement, including fee simple lots,
condominiums, and zero lot line parcels, is permitted in a residential
development proposed as part of an MUTND, provided the arrangement of the
dwelling units shall comply with the spacing requirements of this section.
Within any such sublot, the applicant shall depict the maximum parameters, or
building envelope, which indicates where the buildings shall be located and
demonstrate that such building locations will be in compliance with the spacing
requirements of this section. Alternatively, if such building locations are not
depicted on any such sublots, the Planning Commission may establish on the
development plan the appropriate front, side, and rear yard dimensions for each
sublot.
   (k)   Public Improvements. All public improvements constructed within a
Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood Development shall conform to the design
standards and regulations set forth in the Codified Ordinances and Zoning Code
of the City of Olmsted Falls for such facilities, except as specifically
modified on the approved General Development Plan.
   (l)   Additional Standards. Additional development requirements, whether
standards or criteria, formulated to achieve the objectives of the MUTND may be
established during the Planning Commission’s review of the development plan.
Any such development requirements adopted with such plan shall become binding
land use requirements for the proposed development.
   (m)   Phased Development. If the development is to be implemented in phases,
each phase shall provide adequate access, parking, storm water management, and
other public improvements, including temporary or permanent transitional
features such as buffer areas, in order to prevent any adverse impact on
completed phases, future phases, and adjoining projects.
   (n)   Screening and Landscaping. Screening through the use of walls, fences
and/or landscaping shall be provided to minimize potential incompatibility
between contrasting uses within an MUTND and with adjoining properties. All
open areas, including required yards, shall be landscaped according to an
approved landscape plan. All pervious areas of the MUTND shall be permanently
protected from soil erosion with grass or other suitable ground cover.
   (o)   Enclosed Buildings. All activities except off-street parking,
accessory recreation, and refuse storage shall be conducted in completely
enclosed buildings unless otherwise permitted as a temporary outdoor sale or
display per Section
1274.10. Outdoor seating at eating places may be permitted if approved by the
Planning Commission.
   (p)   Equipment Installation. All equipment or machinery used in servicing a
building, or in processing goods therein, shall be installed entirely within
the building or enclosed or screened on all sides by a solid wall or fence in
compliance with Section
1274.01, and shall be located, isolated or sound insulated in such a manner
that any noise generated thereby is not objectionable beyond the limits of the
lot where such equipment is located, as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (q)   Signs. Signs shall be permitted in a Mixed Use Traditional
Neighborhood Development as authorized and approved by the Planning Commission.
The Commission shall have sole authority to establish the size, design,
character, height, number, style and location of all signage within an MUTND.
The Commission may require the applicant or provide proposed sign standards
package for review and approval as part of the approval of the MUTND. The
Commission may establish specific sign criteria and standards for each MUTND as
it may determine to be appropriate based upon the nature of the development.
Signs within an MUTND shall not be subject to the provisions of Chapter
1272. The Building Commissioner and City Planner may issue sign permits within
any Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood Development based upon the approval and
standards established by the Planning Commission.
      (Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)
 
1260.08 COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS.
   Community associations or similar legal entities that, pursuant to Section
1260.06, are responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas,
including recreational facilities, the natural area corridor, and common open
space, shall be established in such a manner that:
   (a)   Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity
is made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied;
   (b)   The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to
maintain and exercise control over such common areas and facilities; and
   (c)   The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel
contributions from residents of the development to cover their proportionate
shares of the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common
areas and facilities.
      (Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)
 
1260.09 WAIVERS.
   If the Planning Commission determines that certain design standards set
forth in this chapter do not or should not apply specifically to the
circumstances of a particular project, and an alternative method of achieving
the objectives of the numerical standard is equal to or better than the strict
application of the specified standard, the Planning Commission may relax such
standards to an extent deemed just and proper, provided that the granting of
such relief shall be without detriment to the public good and without detriment
to or impairment of the intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 25-2016. Passed 6-28-16.)
 
1260.10 APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   A Mixed Use Traditional Neighborhood District shall be approved according to
the procedures set forth in Sections
1232.05 through
1232.065 for planned developments.

1262.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of the Historic Area Conservation District regulations to
maintain and enhance the distinctive character of an Historic Area Conservation
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of historic structures and
sites and by preventing the intrusion of incompatible development. Furthermore,
it is the intent of these regulations to achieve, among others, the following
related objectives:
   (a)   To foster a sense of community identification and civic pride by
preserving structures and sites which are associated with periods and events in
the history of the community and the region;
   (b)   To stimulate the local economy by protecting and strengthening those
historical qualities of a district which can serve to attract customers,
clients and potential employees; and
   (c)   To protect property values and safeguard the quality of life within a
district by preventing environmental changes which diminish a district's unique
historic and architectural character. (Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.02 DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.
   An Historic Area Conservation District shall be established or amended in
accordance with the standard procedures for amending the Zoning Map as set
forth in Chapter
1212. In addition, no such District shall be established or amended prior to
review and recommendation by the Architectural Board of Review (ABR). Such
recommendation shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. In reviewing a
proposal, the ABR shall determine whether or not the geographic area in
question satisfies the requirements for such District as set forth in Section
1262.03. The primary responsibility for the administration of this chapter
shall be assigned to the ABR.
(Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.03 DISTRICT AREA.
   The Historic Area Conservation District is a concise geographic area in
which structures, spaces, streets, and objects collectively convey a strong
sense of a period (or periods) in history, generally at least fifty years in
the past. The degree to which an area conveys a sense of history is dependent
upon such factors as the following:
   (a)   The architectural and aesthetic quality of older buildings in the
area;
   (b)   The prominence of modern development and other development which does
not contribute to the area's historic character;
   (c)   The area's association with events or individuals significant in
history, and
   (d)   The physical linkages which create a sense of place and cohesiveness
throughout the area. (Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.04 DESIGNATION ON ZONING MAP.
   The Historic Area Conservation District shall be shown on the Zoning Map as
an "H" overlay district, to be applied in conjunction with the underlying
district. Provisions of the underlying district shall remain in effect except
where inconsistent with the Historic Area Conservation District, in which case,
the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.05 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Within the Historic Area Conservation District, no building or other
structure shall be erected, altered in exterior construction or appearance,
enlarged, moved or demolished unless such action complies with Codified
Ordinances Chapter
1444.
(Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.06 PERMITTED USES.
   Within the Historic Area Conservation District, uses shall be permitted as
established in the underlying zoning district, except that restrictions on the
operation of the use may be imposed by Council upon recommendation of the ABR
on a case by case basis when it is determined that such restrictions are
necessary to maintain the integrity of the Historic Area Conservation District.
(Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.07 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   Construction and demolition permits shall not be issued until approvals
required by Section
1444.05 have been issued. (Ord. 76-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1262.08 GUIDELINES FOR REVIEW.
    In its review of applications, the ABR shall follow the guidelines set
forth in Section
1444.06. In addition, in its review of applications of signage, the ABR shall
apply the guidelines set forth in Section
1272.03(e).

1264.01 PURPOSE.
   Certain types of principal uses are classified as conditional uses because
of their unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district.
Rather than assign all uses to special, individual, and limited zoning
districts, it is important to provide controllable and reasonably flexible
requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for
the landowner, but that will, at the same time, maintain adequate provisions
for the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the City's
inhabitants. In order to accomplish both objectives, each land use designated a
conditional use in the district regulations is studied in relation to location,
design, size, operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic
movement, concentration of population, processes and equipment employed, and
the amount and kinds of public facilities and services required, together with
many other factors. Review of this information by the Planning Commission is
required to ensure that each proposed conditional use is consistent with the
intent and objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
Accordingly, conditional uses are not allowed by right, but require a
conditional use certificate to be issued in compliance with the procedures and
requirements of Section
1232.04.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1264.02 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following standards in addition
to any specific conditions, standards, and regulations for such use or category
of uses set forth in Sections
1264.03 through
1264.05. Furthermore, the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts
and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence that:
   (a)   The conditional use in the proposed location will be harmonious and in
accordance with the purpose, intent, and basic planning objectives of this
Zoning Code and for the district in which such use is located, and in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan;
   (b)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general
welfare;
   (c)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
   (d)   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district;
   (e)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
   (f)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
   (g)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
   (h)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets;
   (I)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire, and
schools;
   (j)   There is minimal potential for future hardship that could result from
the conditional use being surrounded by uses that are permitted by right, but
that may be incompatible;
   (k)   The design and arrangement of circulation aisles, parking areas, and
access drives shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1270 and shall provide for interconnecting circulation among adjacent parcels;
and
   (l)   If the conditional use is proposed in a residential district, the
proposed use would generate only a minimum of traffic on a local residential
street.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prohibit the Planning Commission from
prescribing supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition to those above
in order to achieve the objectives stated herein.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1264.03 REGULATIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USES IN DWELLING DISTRICTS.
   In addition to the general criteria established in Sections
1264.01 and
1264.02, the following specific conditions pertaining to each use or group of
uses shall apply.
   (a)   Conformance to District Regulations. A conditional use shall conform
to district regulations, and to other substantive requirements of this Planning
and Zoning Code, as well as satisfy the conditions, standards, and requirements
of this chapter. Whenever there is a difference between the provisions of the
conditional use regulations and the district regulations, the provisions of
this chapter shall prevail, unless clearly indicated differently in the
regulations.
   (b)   Specific Regulations.
      (1)   The schedule following the text of this section sets forth
regulations governing minimum lot area, minimum lot width, and minimum yard
dimensions for principal and accessory buildings and parking areas for
conditional uses in dwelling districts that require lot area, lot width, and
yard regulations which are different from the dwelling district regulations.
      (2)   All conditional uses shall provide adequate parking spaces as set
forth in Chapter
1270 and all parking areas shall be screened in accordance with Section
1274.01. 
      (3)   All signs for conditional uses shall comply with the requirements
set forth in Chapter
1272.
      (4)   Supplemental requirements pertaining to specific uses are set forth
in Section
1264.05 and are referenced in the following schedule:

dwelling is situated on a lot large enough and with sufficient landscaping/
screening, to minimize disruption to surrounding residents.
      (2)   Such use shall comply in all respects with all applicable health
and safety ordinances and regulations, and the premises shall be available for

Schools. In a dwelling, professional, or MUPD District, such public and semi-
public uses may be permitted subject to the following:
      (1)   Such uses should be located on a major street or have direct access
to a major street without going through a residential neighborhood to lessen
the impact on the residential area.
      (2)   When located in a residential district, the access drives shall be
located no less than 100 feet from an intersection.

   (g)   Family Home for Handicapped Persons. In any dwelling district, a
family home for five to eight handicapped persons, as defined in this Planning
and Zoning Code, may be permitted, provided such use is in compliance with the
following:
      (1)   The persons residing in such residential home shall live as a
single housekeeping unit in a single-dwelling unit and maintain said home as
their sole, bona fide, permanent residence. The term “permanent residence”
means:

basis as their sole place of residence; and
         B.   The residents do not live at the dwelling for the primary purpose
of receiving counseling, treatment, therapy, or medical care.
      (2)   Prior to a handicapped person commencing residence in the home,
either the applicant or the placement agency shall certify that it has
determined that the resident is handicapped, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 3602(h),

      (7)   In considering whether to grant the conditional use permit, the
Planning Commission shall take into consideration the proximity of other such
homes for handicapped persons within the neighborhood so as not to change the
character of the area, create undue congestion in the public ways, or otherwise
adversely impact upon a given area with such use, but in no event shall a
family home be closer than 1,500 feet from another family home or group home
for handicapped persons.
      (8)   Evidence shall be presented that the proposed facility meets the
certification, licensing, or approval requirements of the appropriate State
agency. Failure to maintain such license, certification, or other approval

agency. Failure to maintain such license, certification, or other approval
requirements shall result in immediate revocation of the facility's conditional
use certificate.
      (4)   In considering whether to grant the conditional use permit, the
Planning Commission shall take into consideration the proximity and location of
other such facilities within the neighborhood so as not to change the character
of the area, create undue congestion in the public ways, or otherwise adversely
impact upon a given area with such use, but in no event shall a group home or
congregate living facility be closer than 2,000 feet from where a family home
or group home for handicapped persons or congregate living facility is located.

certain types of public and semi-public offices may be permitted to occupy an
existing residential structure when in compliance with all of the following
conditions:
      (1)   The purpose of this provision is to recognize that some existing
residential structures have certain overriding factors which make it unlikely
that such structures will continue to be occupied with the permitted single-
family use or other, more conventional, conditional uses typically located in
residential neighborhoods. Therefore, in order to encourage the preservation of
such structures, certain alternative economic uses may be permitted to occupy
such structures, provided that such reoccupancy preserves and enhances the
community's heritage and character. The use of this provision should only be
considered when the above is true and rezoning the property to accommodate the
office uses would not achieve the preservation objectives and other objectives
of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   The types of offices that may be permitted shall be limited to the
following: Municipal, County, State, or Federal offices; offices of
philanthropic institutions; and private administrative or professional offices;
      (3)   These uses shall be permitted only when the Planning Commission
determines that the application of the provisions of this subsection will
benefit the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the same to a
greater extent than either redevelopment of the property under its current
zoning or development under some other zoning classification, and when the
Planning Commission further determines that reasonable efforts have been made
by the owner to occupy the structure according to alternative permitted
principal or conditional uses; and
      (4)   Such office use(s) shall be permitted only in existing buildings
that have a minimum floor area of 2,000 square feet and were constructed prior
to 1950. Offices may be permitted in structures which do not meet the previous
requirements if the structure has unique characteristics which the Planning
Commission, with the recommendation of the Architectural Board of Review,
determines are significant and should be preserved through such occupancy.
   (q)   Outdoor Commercial Recreation Facilities. Outdoor commercial
recreation facilities may be permitted in a C-2 District in compliance with the
following:
      (1)   The proposed use shall not generate excessive noise, odor, dust, or
smoke beyond the premises. In order to minimize any effects of the above, the
Planning Commission may require all applicable surface areas to be paved, and
impose additional noise reduction measures, including mounding, landscaping,
and sound barriers, to assure that the level of noise is less than or the same
as the prevailing noise levels of permitted uses in the District;
      (2)   All active recreation areas shall be enclosed by a fence having a
minimum height of five feet, unless a different enclosure is approved by the
Planning Commission;
      (3)   Access drives shall be located at least 100 feet from an
intersection;
      (4)   All structures, including lighting fixtures, shall have a maximum
height of thirty-five feet;
      (5)   Rifle ranges, skeet shooting ranges, pistol ranges, and other uses
involving the use of fire arms shall not be permitted;
      (6)   Public restrooms shall be provided and maintained; and
      (7)   The hours of operation may be regulated by the Planning Commission.
   (r)   Outdoor Storage Yards. The regulations in this subsection pertain to
all outdoor storage, including the outdoor storage of fleet vehicles that are
parked and/or stored on-site during non-business hours, but not including new
and used auto sales facilities. Outdoor storage yards in association with a
principal use may be permitted conditionally in C-2 and I-2 Districts subject
to the following:
      (1)   All areas to be devoted to outdoor storage shall be clearly
indicated on the site plan;
      (2)   Outdoor storage yards shall:
         A.   Be located in the rear yard unless Planning Commission determines
that placement in the side yard is less detrimental to affected properties;
         B.   Comply with the building setbacks for the principal use as
specified for the district in which such use is located, except as set forth
below;
         C.   Be located a minimum of 300 feet from a residential district or
use. When the lot on which the outdoor storage yard is located is separated
from the residential district or use by railroad tracks, the setback shall be
measured from the railroad right-of-way line abutting the residential district
or use.
         D.   Be effectively screened from any observer’s view at grade level
on an adjoining road or residential premises, pursuant to Section
1274.01;
      (3)   Outdoor storage yards shall not be located in areas intended for
traffic circulation and/or fire equipment access;
      (4)   The requirements of the performance standards of Section
1274.14 shall be met;
      (5)   The area of the lot devoted to outdoor storage shall not exceed 25%

permitted, subject to the following:
      (1)   Swimming pools, tennis courts, and similar recreation facilities
which are not publicly owned, as defined in Section
1204.03(b), shall be open to only residents of the surrounding residential
development or homeowners association;
      (2)   All loudspeaker systems shall be approved by the Planning
Commission and Council and shall not create a nuisance for adjacent properties;
      (3)   Lighting shall not shine on adjacent property and shall not pose a
hazard to traffic movement;
      (4)   Courts or other outdoor activity areas shall not be located within
any required yard;
      (5)   The Planning Commission may require any outdoor activity area to be
fenced to minimize safety and traffic hazards; and
      (6)   Public and membership pools shall be pools and water bodies
intended for public, semi-public, and private uses other than those specified
as private pools for individual residences. Such pools shall comply with the
following:
         A.   All pools shall be located within an enclosed structure or
completely surrounded by a fence in compliance with Section
1274.12;
         B.   Access to a public or membership pool shall be provided only from
a secondary or major street.
   (t)   Public Utilities. Public utilities, including transmission rights-of-
way and substations, may be permitted in any district, subject to the following
requirements:
      (1)   In dwelling districts, utility transmission rights-of-way and
substations shall only be permitted when such are an essential service for
distribution of utilities to the immediate neighborhood or when topological
features restrict the location of such facilities.
      (2)   Site locations should offer natural or man-made barriers to lessen
any intrusion into residential areas.
      (3)   In Dwelling Districts, no garage, shed, or storage yard shall be
permitted. In all other districts, except the C-2 and I-2 Districts, storage of
materials shall be within a completely enclosed building. In the C-2 and I-
2 Districts, outdoor storage may be permitted.
      (4)   Substations shall be at least 100 feet from a dwelling when located
in a Dwelling District, or 100 feet from a residential district when located in
a P, C, L or MUPD District, or adequately screened, as determined by the
Planning Commission.
      (5)   Such uses shall not be objectionable as to noise, odor, vibration,
electrical interference, or any other disturbance.
   (u)   Adult Entertainment Businesses. The City has determined that
permitting adult entertainment businesses, as defined in Section
1204.03(b)(5A), in proximity to residential, institutional and non-adult
entertainment business oriented retail uses would have a detrimental effect on
such adjacent uses. It has been demonstrated that adult entertainment
businesses have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on
residential and institutional uses, particularly those where children are
present, as well as on adjacent non-adult entertainment business oriented
retail uses. Therefore, in order to prevent potential deterioration in retail
areas in the City, and to avoid potential adverse impacts on residential and
institutional uses, particularly those where children are present, thereby
protecting the public health, safety and welfare, adult entertainment
businesses shall be permitted only in the “I” Industrial Districts, subject to
the following requirements:
      (1)   A commercial establishment may have other principal business
purposes that do not involve offering for sale or rental materials depicting or
describing specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, or
materials designed for use in connection with specified sexual activities, and
still be categorized as an adult bookstore, adult novelty store or adult video
store. Such other business purposes will not serve to exempt such a commercial
establishment from being categorized as an adult bookstore, adult novelty store
or adult video store so long as one of its principal business purposes is
offering for sale or rental for consideration the specified materials, which
are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual
activities or specified anatomical areas or which are designed for use in
connection with specified sexual activities.
      (2)   Adult entertainment businesses shall be located in accordance with
the following distance requirements:
         A.   A minimum of 1,000 feet from the boundaries of any lot containing
a church, a library, a public park or playground, a day care center, a school
or any other institution where children are regularly to be found day or night;
         B.   A minimum of 350 feet from any residentially zoned parcel in the
City or any adjacent community; and
         C.   A minimum of 1,000 feet from any other adult entertainment
business. (Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
   (v)   Home Occupation, Type B. A Type B Home Occupation may be permitted as
a conditional use.
      (1)   Such conditional use may be allowed provided that:
         A.   The Type B Home Occupation is conducted only in a single- or two-
family dwelling and does not interfere with the residential use of any non-
applicant; and
         B.   One non-resident employee and/or customers come to the home only
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 12:00
noon and 6:00 p.m. Sunday and customers come to the home by pre-arrangement
only; and
         C.   Off-street parking to meet the standards specified in Section
1270 is available onsite; and
         D.   The Type B Home Occupation does not generate substantially more
pedestrian or vehicular traffic than that generated by a residential use.
      (2)   A Conditional Use Permit issued pursuant to this subsection
1264.05(v) shall expire thirty-six (36) months after the date of issuance.
(Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter or this Section to the contrary, if
the Commissioner determines that a permit holder seeking renewal of a permit
issued pursuant to this Section remains in compliance with the conditions of
said permit, the Commissioner may issue such renewal).
         (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
   (w)   Produce Stands. For the purpose of this Planning and Zoning Code, in
addition to meeting the general criteria stated in Section
1264.02, produce stands shall be regulated as follows:
      (1)   The produce to be sold shall be limited to fresh raw fruits and
vegetables for human consumption. The produce shall have been locally grown,
and shall be offered for sale only during the June 1 to October 31 time period,
inclusive.
      (2)   The stands for the display and sale of the products shall be of a
stable structure able to withstand local normal wind loads but of a temporary
nature and in place only during the approved period for the sale of the
products. Only one such stand is permitted and the maximum area of the
structure shall be 100 square feet. The design shall be submitted for approval
with the application. Displays or sales from trucks, trailers, or additional
tables outside the stand shall not be permitted.
      (3)   Areas devoted to the produce stand shall comply with all building
setbacks and yard regulations for the district in which they are located as set
forth in this code, except as otherwise stated. The method of providing for
parking and/or movement of customer vehicles shall be defined in the
application.
      (4)   The hours of operation shall be only from sunrise to sunset.
      (5)   One sign only is allowed and it shall be temporary, structurally
sound, and attached to the stand structure. The maximum area shall be 4 square
feet.
      (6)   The space for such temporary sales shall be kept free of litter and
debris and all refuse shall be removed each evening at the close of business.
All products displayed or stored shall be kept at least six inches off the
ground at all times. At the end of the permitted sale period, the space shall
be restored to its original condition.
      (7)   The applicant shall submit the structural design of the stand, the
design and location of the sign, if any, the hours and period of operation, and
the site plan including the traffic pattern, to the Planning Commission for
approval. Prior to approval, the Planning Commission shall refer requests for
produce stands to the abr for comment according to Chapter
1444.
      (8)   A permit (other than for produce stands to be located at nurseries
and greenhouses, for which see Section
1264.05(m)) shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. Only one such
permit shall be issued for any one time period for any property or business
location, and sales from the produce stand shall be conducted only by the
owners or lessees of the property or the primary business at the location and/
or their employees.

1268.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulations set forth in this chapter are intended to encourage the use
of Planned Residential Developments in order to accomplish the general purpose
of this Planning and Zoning Code, as stated in Chapter
1202, and to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)   To allow creativity, variety, and flexibility in design as necessary
to implement the various goals and objectives set forth in this chapter.
   (b)   To promote economical and efficient use of land through unified
development.
   (c)   To permit the application of modern planning techniques in the
development of such residential areas.
   (d)   To permit the flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to
encourage the conservation of the natural amenities of the site and the
provision of readily accessibly recreation areas and green spaces.
   (e)   To reduce the problems created by intensive development of areas which
have excessively high water tables, which are subject to flooding, or which are
topographically or otherwise unsuited for urban uses.
   (f)   To ensure that the proposed Planned Residential Development occurs in
a unified manner in accordance with a development plan prepared by the property
owner.
   It is not the intention of this chapter to allow the creation of small lot
subdivisions, and, if the above objectives are not achieved, then the Planning
Commission will not approve the Planned Residential Development proposal, in
which case the standard zoning prevails.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.02 CONFORMITY TO STANDARDS.
   A Planned Residential Development (PRD) is a conditional use in all D
Dwelling Districts. The standards set forth in this chapter shall be observed
in the design and construction of any planned residential development.
(Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1268.03 MINIMUM PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land proposed to be developed as a Planned
Residential Development (PRD) shall be a minimum of ten acres. The area
proposed shall be in one ownership or, if in several ownerships, the
application shall be filed jointly by all the owners of the properties included
in the Planned Residential Development.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.04 DWELLING TYPES.
   Listed below are the dwelling types and principal uses which may be included
as part of PRD in a specific residential district when denoted by the letter

1268.05 COMMON OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the public parks and public open space requirements set forth
in Chapter
1216, a portion of the total project area in a PRD shall be devoted to common
open space. Such common open space shall comply with the following regulations:
   (a)   The common open space in a PRD shall have a minimum area equal to:
      (1)   25% of the total project area of a PRD in a D-1 District.
      (2)   20% of the total project area of a PRD in a D-2, D-3, D-4, or D-
5 District.
   (b)   Other common areas, including parking areas, land fragments between
two or more buildings, land fragments between buildings and parking areas,
required yards between project boundaries and buildings or parking areas, and
improved recreation areas such as recreation centers, swimming pools, tennis
courts, etc., shall not be included as common open space.
   (c)   Common open space shall be located and designed, insofar as is
practicable, so as to:
      (1)   Be integrally related to the overall design of the development with
respect to its location, distribution, size, and shape so as to be beneficial
and easily accessible to the maximum possible number of residents of the PRD.
      (2)   Conserve significant natural features, such as wetlands, woodlands,
lakes or ponds, historic lands, environmentally sensitive areas, and similar
conservation-oriented areas, to the extent practicable.
      (3)   Be visible from existing public streets within the development and/
or generally from many dwelling units within the development that do not
directly abut the open space.
   (d)   The common open space established as part of a PRD shall be:
      (1)   Retained by the owners of the planned development area;
      (2)   Dedicated to a homeowners association or similar legal entity that
shall have title to the land to be retained as common open space; or
      (3)   Offered to the City for public open space. The City shall have the
right to not accept any land area offered to the City. In the event of such
refusal, the conditions of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) above shall apply.
Any land area that is accepted by the City for dedication as public open space
shall also continue to be counted toward the requirement for common open space.
   (e)   The legal articles relating to the ownership, management, public
easements if any, and maintenance of such common open space shall be reviewed
and approved by the City’s Law Director. The Law Director shall indicate such
approval prior to the development plan being approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (f)   In addition to the common open space requirements set forth in this
section, all residential developments shall comply with the requirements for
public parks and public open space set forth in Chapter
1216.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1268.06 DENSITY.
   The overall density of a PRD shall be determined by the district in which
the PRD is located and shall not exceed the density set forth below for the
district in which the PRD is located:
   (a)   One dwelling unit per acre in a D-1 District, provided that on any one
acre there shall not be more than two dwelling units.
   (b)   One and one-half dwelling units per acre in a D-2 District, provided
that on any one acre there shall not be more than three dwelling units.
   (c)   Three dwelling units per acre in a D-3 District, provided that on any
one acre there shall not be more than five dwelling units.
   (d)   Five dwelling units per acre in a D-4 District, provided that on any
one acre there shall not be more than eight dwelling units.
   (e)   Seven dwelling units per acre in a D-5 District, provided that on any
one acre there shall not be more than ten dwelling units.
   The maximum number of dwelling units permitted for a particular site shall
be calculated by multiplying the total land area, exclusive of public rights-
of-way existing at the time the development plan is submitted, by the overall
density permitted per acre for the district in which the site is located. An
imaginary square, approximately 209 feet by 209 feet, shall be used to
determine the maximum number of units on any one acre on the site. A unit shall
be counted as a unit if 50% or more of its area falls within the imaginary
square.
(Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1268.07 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following specific development standards shall be adhered to in the
design and layout of any Planned Residential Development.
   (a)   Minimum Building Setbacks From Project Boundaries and Streets. All
buildings and structures shall maintain the following minimum setbacks:
      (1)   When the wall of a building faces an existing or proposed public
right-of- way, the minimum setback for such wall shall be fifty feet from the
right- of-way line.
      (2)   When the wall of a building faces any PRD project boundary line,
the minimum setback for such wall shall be:
         A.   Fifty feet or a distance equal to the length of the wall,
whichever is greater, when adjacent to a D-1 District;
         B.   Thirty feet or a distance equal to one-half the length of the
wall, whichever is greater, when adjacent to a D-2 or D-3 District; however, in
no case shall the required setback exceed 100 feet.
         C.   Thirty feet or a distance equal to one-half the length of the
wall, whichever is greater, when adjacent to a D-4 or D-5 District; however, in
no case shall the required setback exceed sixty feet.
      (3)   When the wall of a building abuts a private street or driveway, the
minimum setback for such wall shall be twenty feet from the edge of the
pavement.
      (4)   No part of any unit, including projections that comply with Section
1240.10, shall be closer than the setbacks specified in items (a)(1), (a)(2),
and (a)(3) above. These spacing requirements shall be measured from the closest
point of the building wall including projections that comply with Section
1240.10.
   (b)   Minimum Separation Between Buildings. In order to ensure reasonable
privacy and separation, walls of individual buildings located within the PRD
shall be separated by the minimum distances set forth below:
      (1)   When two walls facing each other both contain windows of living
areas, or adjacent patios or decks, the minimum separation shall be twenty feet
plus an additional foot for every five feet of wall length overlap in excess of
twenty feet.
      (2)   When either of the two walls facing each other contains windows of
living areas, or adjacent patios or decks, the minimum separation shall be
fifteen feet.
      (3)   When neither of the two walls contain windows of living areas, or
adjacent patios or decks, the minimum separation shall be ten feet.
      (4)   No part of any unit, including projections that comply with Section
1240.10, shall be closer than the specified separation. These spacing
requirements shall be measured from the closest point of the building wall
including projections that comply with Section
1240.10.
   (c)   Unbroken Wall Length. No wall or facade shall extend for more than
three units without being changed in plane by at least five feet. In such case,
the roof line of the building shall also be changed in plane.
   (d)   Parking Setbacks. Off-street parking lots shall be located:
      (1)   A minimum of ten feet from a private street.
      (2)   A minimum of fifteen feet from an existing or proposed public
right-of- way.
      (3)   A minimum of fifteen feet from any PRD project boundary line.
      (4)   A minimum of twenty feet from any building, except that private
drives providing direct access to a single-family dwelling or townhouse shall
be exempt from this requirement.
   (e)   Swimming Pools. Community swimming pools shall be located at least 100
feet from any principal building.
   (f)   Public Streets. Publicly dedicated streets shall be required for the
following:
      (1)   For access to all subdivided standard lots for detached single-
family dwellings.
      (2)   For major through streets in any development which connect two
existing public streets and which are expected to accommodate pass-through
traffic going to and from adjacent areas.
   (g)   Private Streets. Streets not required to be public streets pursuant to
subsection (f) hereof may be approved by the Planning Commission as private
streets if the development will be perpetually managed and maintained by the
developer, a homeowner’s or community association, or other such management
structure acceptable to the City.
      (1)   Any element of a private street which is constructed or installed
shall be constructed in compliance with public street construction standards,
including width.
      (2)   The total length of any single access “dead-end” private street, or
public street and private street in combination, which exceeds 800 feet in
length, shall have a turn-around at the end with a radius equal to that
required for public streets. Landscaping may be required in the center of turn-
arounds.
   (h)   Access Drives. All residential access drives shall be paved, and shall
otherwise meet the construction and size requirements for a drive for a single-
family residence. However, when the Planning Commission determines that the
access drive is expected to repeatedly accommodate large and heavy vehicles
such as moving vans, rubbish trucks, or other service vehicles, the access
drive shall meet the construction standards for public streets.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
   (i)   Ownership. Any ownership arrangement, including fee simple lots,
condominiums, and zero lot line parcels, is permitted in a Planned Residential
Development, provided the arrangement of the dwelling units shall comply with
the spacing requirements of this section. Within any such sublot, the applicant
shall depict the maximum parameters, or building envelope, which indicates
where the buildings shall be located and demonstrate that such building
locations will be in compliance with the spacing requirements of this section.
Alternatively, if such building locations are not depicted on any such sublots,
the Planning Commission may establish on the development plan the appropriate
front, side, and rear yard dimensions for each sublot.
   (j)   Additional Standards. Additional development requirements, whether
standards or criteria, formulated to achieve the objectives of the PRD District
may be established at the time the PRD development plan is reviewed. Any such
development requirements adopted with such plan shall become binding land use
requirements for the proposed Planned Residential Development.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.08 HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.
   Homeowners associations, community associations, or similar legal entities
that, pursuant to Section
1268.05(d), are responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas,
including recreational facilities and common open space, shall be established
in such a manner that:
   (a)   Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity
is made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied;
   (b)   The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to
maintain and exercise control over such common areas and facilities; and
   (c)   The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel
contributions from residents of the development to cover their proportionate
shares of the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common
areas and facilities. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (d)   The association’s or similar legal entity’s covenants and restrictions
convey to the City and other appropriate governmental bodies the right to enter
any common area for emergency purposes or, after proper notice, in the event of
nonperformance of maintenance improvements affecting the public health, safety,
and welfare. Such governmental bodies shall have the right, after proper
notice, to make improvements and perform maintenance functions. In addition,
the City shall have the right to proceed against the association for
reimbursements of resulting costs including the right to file liens against
individual condominium units, houses, and vacant building lots. (Ord. 75-2005.
Passed 10-11-05.)
1268.09 PHASED DEVELOPMENT.
   If the development is to be implemented in phases, each phase shall have
adequate provision for access, parking, storm water management, and other
public improvements to serve the development in accordance with the applicable
criteria set forth. Each phase shall be provided with temporary or permanent
transitional features, buffers, or protective areas in order to prevent any
adverse impact on completed phases, future phases, and adjoining property.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.10 WAIVERS.
   If the Planning Commission determines that certain design standards set
forth in Sections
1268.03,
1268.05, and
1268.07 do not or should not apply specifically to the circumstances of a
particular project and an alternative method of achieving the objectives of the
numerical standard is equal to or better than the strict application of the
specified standard, the Planning Commission may relax such standards to an
extent deemed just and proper, provided that the granting of such relief shall
be without detriment to the public good and without detriment to or impairment
of the intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.11 APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   A Planned Residential Development shall be approved according to the
procedures set forth in Section
1232.05 for planned developments.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1268.12 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   A performance bond shall be required. Such bond shall guarantee the
completion of all public improvements required by the City prior to the
issuance of a building permit. The scope and amount of such performance bond
shall be established by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)

1270.01 PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established to achieve, among other
things, the following:
   (a)   To relieve congestion so streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
separating parking areas and extensive car movements in the vicinity of
pedestrian ways;
   (c)   To screen off-street parking areas from adjacent development and
residential neighborhoods; and
   (d)   To promote the general convenience, welfare, and prosperity of
residential, office, commercial, and industrial developments, which depend on
off-street parking facilities. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1270.02 PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES REQUIRED
   Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, as a condition precedent to
the occupancy or use of any building, structure, or land for residential,
office, commercial, institutional, or recreational use, whenever:
   (a)   A building is constructed or a new use established;
   (b)   An existing building is altered and/or there is an increase in the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity, and/or floor area of a building, or
in any other unit of measurement, which creates a need for an increase or
decrease of more than ten percent in the number of required off-street parking
or loading spaces; or
   (c)   The use of an existing building or structure or use of land is changed
to a use requiring more off-street parking facilities.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1270.03 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT.
   For the purpose of computing required parking spaces, as set forth in this
chapter, the following units of measurement shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used for all
land uses, unless otherwise specified.
   (b)   Seating Capacity. Where seating capacity is the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed or indicated, or each twenty-four inches of bench
seating. When fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity shall be determined
as being one seat for each twenty square feet of floor area of the assembly
room. Where the Fire Prevention Code establishes a lower maximum seating
capacity, the number of spaces provided shall comply with the Fire Prevention

(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
1270.05 MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS.
   Whenever the parking requirements for a proposed use based on the
application of the standards specified in Section
1270.04 can be shown by the applicant to result in an excessive number of
parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent
with these regulations, the Planning Commission may approve a development plan
with a reduction in the required spaces according to the following provisions:
   (a)   Joint Use. Up to fifty percent of the required off-street parking
facilities for a church, theater, or similar use may be supplied by off-street
parking facilities provided for certain other uses, such as banks, offices, or
service uses, which are not normally open or in use at the time of the
principal operating hours of churches, theaters, or similar uses. Conversely,
up to fifty percent of the required off-street parking for banks, offices, or
service establishments may be supplied by parking facilities provided for
churches, theaters, or similar uses. In either case, a properly drawn legal
instrument shall be executed between the affected parties. Such instrument
shall be approved as to form and manner of execution by the Law Director and
shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Mixed Occupancies. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements
for off-street parking or loading facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking and
loading facilities provided for one use shall not be construed as providing
such facilities for another use, except as specified for a joint use in
subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Collective Provision of Facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent collective provision of off-street parking or loading
facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided that the total of such
off-street spaces supplied collectively is not less than the sum of the
requirements for the various uses computed separately, and provided, further,
that the requirements of maximum distances between parking areas and the
establishments such areas serve, as set forth in Section
1270.06, shall apply.
   (d)   Reduction of Required Spaces in the Historic Area Conservation
District. In recognition of the historic, compact character of buildings in the
Historic Area Conservation District, as well as the less efficient use of the
floor area of those buildings, the Planning Commission may approve as a
conditional use a development plan with a reduction in the requirements of
Section
1270.04. In making such determination, the Planning Commission shall consider
the following criteria:
      (1)   The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and
the ability of the proposed use to reinforce the existing environment.
      (2)   The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both
on-street and within public parking lots.
      (3)   The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering
the hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses.
      (4)   The potential negative impact to the character of the District if
the requisite number of parking spaces are provided.
         (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (e)   Deferred Construction of Required Spaces. If the number of parking
spaces required in Schedule
1270.04 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the applicant
and the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports the reduced
parking needs, a development plan may be approved with an allowance for the
construction of fewer parking spaces, provided that:
      (1)   The total number of spaces initially constructed shall not be less
than seventy percent of the spaces required by Schedule
1270.04.
      (2)   Adequate land area is reserved, if the Planning Commission so
requires, for all or a portion of the reduced number of spaces otherwise
required by Schedule
1270.04. Such suitable areas shall be illustrated on the development plan in
locations and with landscaping in full compliance with this Zoning Code.
      (3)   The Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project's parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the parking spaces identified
in paragraph (e)(2) hereof be constructed. If such additional parking spaces
are required, they shall be provided according to the approved development
plan.
         (Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
1270.06 LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be located as follows:
   (a)   Compliance Required. The location of parking shall comply with the
parking setback requirements of the district in which such parking is located.
In Dwelling Districts, the location of open parking areas shall comply with the
requirements of Section
1240.09. :
   (b)   Single-Family Detached Dwellings and Single-Family Attached Dwellings.
Parking spaces required for dwelling units shall be located on the same lot as
the dwelling unit served, except that spaces for attached single-family
dwellings shall be no more than 200 feet from the entrance of the dwelling unit
such spaces are designed to serve.

      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1270.07 ACCESS DRIVES.
   Each parking space and loading space for uses other than detached single-
family dwellings shall be provided access in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Number of Drives. Each lot shall be required to have at least one two-
way access drive or a pair of one-way drives. Access drives shall be designed

   (d)   Paving. All parking spaces and driveways shall be improved with
concrete, asphalt, or other material approved by the Planning Commission.
Existing unpaved driveways and parking areas shall be clearly defined by
permanent edging such as curbs or embedded rot-resistant timbers.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1270.08 OFF-STREET WAITING SPACES FOR DRIVE-THRU FACILITIES.
   Drive-thru establishments and other establishments which by their nature
create lines of customers waiting to be served within automobiles shall provide
off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use, in addition to the
required number of parking spaces specified in Section

1271.01 INTENT.
   These regulations are established to provide for the construction and use of
wireless telecommunication towers and facilities as permitted uses and
conditional uses depending on the specific land areas of the City in which they
are proposed to be located. The purpose of these regulations is to balance the
competing interests created by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996,
Public Law 104-104, and the interests of the City in regulating wireless
telecommunication towers and related facilities. Specifically, these
regulations are intended to achieve the following purposes:
   (a)   To protect property values;
   (b)   To regulate a commercial use so as to provide for orderly and safe
development within the City;
   (c)   To provide for and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of
the residents of the City;
   (d)   To minimize any adverse effects on residential properties, parks, open
spaces, and the non-intensive commercial zoning districts; and
   (e)   To promote co-location of wireless telecommunication facilities in
order to decrease the number of towers in the City.
      (Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)

(Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1271.05 PROHIBITED LOCATIONS.
   All wireless telecommunications towers or facilities are prohibited in the
Historic Area Conservation District.
(Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1271.06 STANDARDS APPLICABLE FOR CONDITIONAL USE APPLICATIONS.
   In order for the Planning Commission to consider the location of a wireless
telecommunication tower and facility as a conditional use:
   (a)   The applicant shall list the location of every tower, building, or
structure and all of the areas set forth in Section
1271.03 that could support the proposed antenna(s) so as to allow it to serve
its intended function, and shall indicate the reasons why such tower, building,
or structure or area has been determined not to be technically suitable.
   (b)   If another tower, building, or structure set forth in Section
1271.03 is technically suitable, the applicant must show, to the satisfaction
of the Planning Commission, that:
      (1)   It has made reasonable efforts to request co-location on the
existing tower, building, or structure and the co-location request was not
accepted by the owner of the tower, building, or structure; or
      (2)   It has made reasonable efforts to request all property owners with
technically suitable locations to permit it to locate a tower under reasonable
terms and the request was not accepted.
   (c)   As a condition of issuing a conditional use certificate to construct
and operate a tower in the City, the owner/operator of the telecommunications
tower is required to allow co-location until said tower has reached full
antenna capacity, but in no event shall there be fewer than two additional
antenna platforms for two additional providers unrelated to the owner/operator.
Agreement to this provision must be included in the applicant’s lease with the
landowner, if different from the owner/operator of the tower. Written
documentation must be presented to the Planning Commission evidencing that the
landowner of the property on which the tower is to be located has agreed to the
terms of this subsection as well as all other applicable requirements,
regulations, and standards set forth in this section.
   (d)   Any towers which are proposed as conditional uses shall be a minimum
of one-half mile from any other tower proposed or previously approved as a
conditional use.
      (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
 
1271.07 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   All wireless telecommunication towers and facilities shall comply with the

   (b)   Unless otherwise provided for in this section, a wireless
telecommunication facility must comply with the setback and yard requirements
applicable to buildings in the underlying zone in which it is located. When
such facility is located on property adjoining the electric high tension power
line easement, this setback requirement shall not apply to the boundary line of
the electric high tension power line utility easement. A wireless
telecommunication tower must be placed upon the lot in such a way as to
minimize the visual impact on adjoining roads and properties. In no event shall
any portion of a wireless telecommunication facility be located in front of the
principal use or building on the lot, if any.
   (c)   Recognizing that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may impose
greater restrictions, a wireless telecommunication tower shall in no event be
more than 200 feet in height as measured from the average ground level at the
base of the tower. The applicant for a proposed tower shall demonstrate that
the proposed tower is the minimum height necessary to accommodate the antennas
and is no higher than existing towers housing similar antennas in the City and
the surrounding communities. For a new tower with a height greater than those
prevailing in the area, or a tower in a location not in compliance with these
regulations, the applicant shall demonstrate to the City that such new tower or
additional height is needed to meet the reasonable service requirements of the
applicant. Prior to the Planning Commission's consideration of the application,
the applicant shall submit documentation that includes consideration of
alternative sites and the operational implications of such alternatives with
respect, but not limited, to: height, opportunities for co-location, impact on
residents, and impact on service levels. The City may retain consultant(s) to
review the information, with all reasonable costs for such consultation being
borne by the applicant(s).

enclosed with a secure fence having a minimum height of six feet but not
greater than eight feet. Such fence shall be equipped with a locked gate.
   (g)   A landscaped buffer area of not less than fifteen feet in depth shall
be placed between the wireless telecommunication facilities and the public
rights-of-way and any adjacent properties from which a direct view can be had
of the facilities, other than the tower itself. The buffer area shall consist
of at least one of the following: (1)   A row of hardy evergreen trees tightly
spaced. The initial plantings shall be no less than six feet tall.
      (2)   Existing vegetation, inclusive of trees and shrubs, shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible.

      (1)   Political signs. No person shall display a political sign in any
district which is not in accordance with the following regulations:
         A.   Such signs may be displayed in a window on the premises or in a
yard, provided that such yard signs are located a minimum of five feet from any
lot line and that the height of such signs does not exceed four feet. Such
signs may be displayed only if the owner or legal occupant has given approval.
         B.   One such sign may be displayed on each property or parcel of
record for each political office or position or issue.
         C.   A sign may not exceed five square feet in area per side.
         D.   Such signs shall not be illuminated.
         E.   No such sign shall be displayed on any utility pole, tree lawn,
or any public right-of-way.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
         F.   Such signs may be put in place no earlier than ten (10) calendar
days prior to the date that absentee ballots may be received by the Board of
Elections for the election to which such sign pertains, and must be removed
from view no later than two (2) days following the election.
            (Ord. 57-2015. Passed 11-10-15.)
   The Zoning Administrator may remove any such sign posted in a public right
of way, tree lawn, or utility pole. He or she may determine the cost of removal
and assess such cost to the person, business, organization, or entity who
posted the sign(s).
      (2)   Real estate "For Sale, Lease, or Rent” signs and temporary
development signs. Real estate signs and development signs shall be permitted
as temporary, nonilluminated signs located on the subject property, provided
that such signs are displayed in compliance with the following regulations.
Unless otherwise noted, such signs are permitted as ground, wall or window
signs. All such signs must be removed within seven days after the sale or
rental of the property, or the completion of the development.
         A.   Real estate "For Sale" or "For Rent" signs.
            1.    Single-family attached or detached dwellings. One real-
estate sign advertising the sale or rental of property shall be permitted for
each dwelling or vacant lot, provided that such sign exceeds neither four
square feet in area nor four feet in height. For attached single-family
dwellings, such sign may be located either in the yard or in a window, but not
in both locations.
            2.    Non-residential uses. One real-estate sign advertising the
sale or rental of property shall be permitted for each nonresidential
establishment, provided that such sign exceeds neither eight square feet in
area nor five feet in height. For establishments which lack direct and
exclusive ground floor access, only window signs are permitted unless written
permission for some other legal location is granted by both the occupant and
the owner of the ground property.
         B.   Real estate "Sold" signs. If a property has been sold, that fact
may be indicated under the following conditions:
            1.    Such sign may be posted only with the written approval of the
owner/seller.
            2.    The sold sign may be posted for no longer than seven days,
except for vacant lots of new developments, in which case the sold sign may be
left up until eighty percent of the lots are sold or fifty percent of the lots
are occupied, whichever comes first. The specific date that the “sold sign” was
posted must be displayed on the "sold" sign in legible characters no less than
one-half of an inch high.
            3.    The area and height of the "sold" indication, in combination
with the “for sale” sign, shall not exceed the four square feet and four feet
height allowance stated above.
            4.    If any of the three conditions just cited are violated, the
sign may be confiscated and/or the business that place the sign may be cited
for violation by the Zoning Administrator.
               (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
         C.   Temporary development and construction signs.
            1.    One- and two-family dwellings.
               a.    For subdivisions of seven lots or more and for attached
single-family developments of seven units or more, one temporary ground sign
announcing the development or the availability of properties under construction
shall be permitted, provided that the sign does not exceed sixteen square feet
in area per side, does not exceed four feet in height above the natural grade
and is set back at least five feet from any street right-of-way line. However,
such sign may be a maximum of twenty-four square feet in area and a maximum of
five feet in height if set back at least fifteen feet from any street right-of-
way line.
               b.    For a smaller project, one temporary ground sign of not
greater than six square feet in area per side and not more than four feet in
height above the natural grade is permitted.
               c.    For remodeling projects, additions or other home
improvement projects, one temporary ground sign stating the name, address and/
or telephone number of the registered contractor and the scope of the project
is permitted, provided that the sign does not exceed four square feet in area
per side and four feet in height above the natural grade. Such sign shall be
permitted only during the period of time that the home improvement project is
under construction.
                  (Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
            2.    Nonresidential and multi-family uses. One temporary
development sign, not to exceed twenty-four square feet in area per side, and a
maximum of five feet in height above natural grade, and located not less than
twenty feet from any lot line, announcing a proposed building or a building
under construction, shall be permitted on the lot to be occupied by the
proposed building or building under construction.
            3.    Removal. Such signs shall be removed within fourteen days of
the beginning of the intended use of the project.
            4.    Permit requirements. Development signs require permits and
approval of their design by the Architectural Board of Review issued in the
manner described in Section
1272.07 and shall be issued for a period not to exceed one year. Such permits
may be renewed by the Zoning Administrator if construction is being diligently
pursued and the sign is being well maintained.
      (3)   Permanent development and building identification signs. The
location of such signs shall be approved by the Planning Commission, and their
design shall be approved by the Architectural Board of Review by the time of
the approval of the final plat or development plan.
         A.   Development signs, permanent.
            1.    If the project is for an area that is greater than eight
acres, a permanent development sign for the overall project is permitted. If
there is more than one major street entrance to the project, a sign is
permitted at each entry. The sign must, in all cases, be a ground sign. The
sign in a D Dwelling District may not be greater than sixteen square feet in
area per side and may not be more than five feet in height.
            2.    If the project is for an area of less than eight acres but
more than three acres, one ground sign not greater than six square feet in area
per side and not more than four feet in height is permitted.
            3.    Such signs may be illuminated, but only externally.
         B.   Building identification signs, multi-family. In multi-family
developments of two or more residential buildings having four or more dwelling
units per building, each building shall be permitted one wall, canopy or ground
sign displaying the name and address of the building. The ground or wall sign
shall not be greater than ten square feet in area. The ground sign shall not be
greater than four feet in height above the surrounding natural grade. For
canopy signs, see Section
1272.05(b).
      (4)   Churches, public schools and private schools.
         A.   One changeable-copy/bulletin-board type sign or announcement sign
not exceeding thirty square feet in sign face area and not exceeding five feet
in height, shall be permitted on the premises of any church, or public or
private school, provided such sign is set back at least ten feet from any side
or rear lot line and five feet from any street right-of-way.
         B.   If a changeable-copy/bulletin-board type of sign is not to be
used, then a ground sign with a maximum area of twenty-four square feet and a
maximum height of four feet is permitted. The location requirements remain the
same.
   Such signs may be illuminated internally or externally if they are
identification signs only.
         C.   Two directional signs, if necessary, are permitted.
      (5)   Greenhouse and nurseries. Greenhouses and nurseries are allowed
conditionally in some dwelling (residential) districts because of the
historical agricultural character of those specific areas of the City.
Greenhouses and nurseries are allowed signs in such residential districts as
follows:
         A.   One ground sign not exceeding thirty square feet in sign face
area and not exceeding five feet in height, shall be permitted on the premises,
provided such sign is set back at least fifty feet from any side or rear lot
line and fifteen feet from any street right-of-way.
            1.    Recognizing that, although the primary purpose of most of
these operations is for wholesale sales, they also sell at retail, they are
permitted to have up to one-half of their allowed sign area in changeable
letters to announce the availability of seasonal products.
            2.    Such signs may be illuminated, but only externally, and only
with white light.
         B.   In addition, two directional signs are permitted, if necessary.
             (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
      (6)   Gasoline service stations. Signs for gasoline service stations
shall conform with all regulations of this chapter except for those which
directly conflict with the regulations stated below. Service stations are
permitted one ground sign (and no pole signs) unless the Planning Commission
finds it appropriate to approve more at the time of the site plan review.
         A.   Ground signs. Such signs may display only sign panels which: (1)
display the company name; (2) identify the station ownership or management;
and/or (3) advertise the price of fuel in terms of type, grade or form of
service. The maximum area per face is forty square feet. The only changeable
sign panels shall be those indicating the price of fuel and they shall not
exceed twelve inches in height (plus a maximum of an additional six inches to
indicate fuel grade). The maximum overall height shall not be greater than
seven feet, except that the Architectural Board of Review may require a lower
height than that requested if it is decided that a lower sign is more
appropriate for the area. If the service station occupies a corner lot, such
allowed ground sign may be placed near the corner formed by the intersection of
the two right-of-way lines if the total sign is not more than thirty square
feet per face and the overall height is no more than five feet. Such a location
may be used only upon approval by the Planning Commission after consultation
with the Safety Director.
         B.   Signs at fuel pumps/service islands. Such signs shall be limited
to those which display information regarding the type of service provided or
other information essential for directing or instructing the motorist who has
entered the station area. The number, area and height of such signs shall be as
determined by the Architectural Board of Review. (State law requires that the
self serve islands be marked with the words “self serve” or “full serve”, as
appropriate, in letters four inches high.)
         C.   Canopies. For canopy structures which shelter service islands, no
signs or logos shall be displayed on the canopy fascia area. Furthermore, the
canopy fascia area shall not be illuminated and shall be designed in a manner
which does not call attention to the canopy structure.
            (Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99.)
      (7)   Temporary signs on public property.
         A.   Temporary signs, banners, etc. may be suspended over or placed
upon public property only by special permit as provided for in this paragraph.
No such temporary sign shall be permitted for a period of more than twenty
days, unless specifically extended beyond such time period for good cause shown
by the issuing authority as provided hereinafter. Further, no ground sign may
exceed twenty- four square feet in area and four feet in height. There may be
no more than two signs at any given time, unless a special exception for
additional signs is approved by the issuing authority provided for hereinafter.
         B.   The purpose of the temporary signs shall be to announce civic or
community affairs of a public or semipublic nature, local to the City of
Olmsted Falls, and not for private gain.
         C.   The special permit for such signs may be issued only by the Mayor
or Council.
      (8)   Changeable copy/bulletin boards. Changeable copy signs are not
permitted except:
         A.   For churches and schools as described in paragraph (d)(4) hereof;
         B.   For greenhouses and nurseries as described in paragraph (d)(5)
hereof; and
         C.   For indicating the prices of fuel in a service station as
described in paragraph (d)(6) hereof. (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
      (9)   Non-commercial yard and garage sale and “Open House” signs. Non-
commercial yard and garage sale and “Open House” signs are permitted in public
tree lawns under the following limitations:
         A.   No sign or message shall exceed four square feet.
         B.   Each sign must be free standing and ground supported. Signs may
not be attached to trees, utility poles, streetlights, public benches, or other
existing devices.
         C.   No sign shall be placed farther than 1500 feet from the subject
property.
         D.   No such signs may be in place between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or
when the function advertised is not open.
         E.   No such sign may be within 500 feet of another advertising the
same event.
         F.   No more than three such signs advertising separate events may be
at any one location.
         G.   No sign shall obstruct traffic, or pedestrian sightlines, public
roadways, or sidewalks. Any such signs may be removed, confiscated, or
destroyed by city officials, without notice, if deemed to be a hazard, not in
compliance with these limitations, or a debasement of the appearance of the
neighborhood.
            (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
   (e)   Illumination of Signs. If lighting of signs is permitted for a
business, such signs shall be illuminated only during the hours of operation of
the business.
      (1)   Animated, blinking, flashing, fluttering or moving signs, or the
outline illumination of signs, shall not be permitted in any district. Beacon
lights or searchlights are prohibited. Strobe lights or incandescent lamps
which expose the face of the bulb, light or lamp to any public street or
adjacent property shall not be used on the exterior surface of any sign.
Strings of lights are not permitted. Exposed neon tubing is not permitted
unless the use is specifically approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
      (2)   The allowed methods of illumination (where illumination is
permitted)   are colored lights, illuminated surface colors, internal
illumination (a light source concealed or contained within the sign which
becomes visible in darkness through a translucent surface) and external
indirect illumination (a light source not seen directly). Within residential
areas, or within 250 feet thereof, only white illumination shall be permitted.
      (3)   External illumination, if allowed, shall be shielded from all
adjacent residential buildings and streets, shall not be of such brightness as
to cause glare hazardous to pedestrians or motorists or cause reasonable
objection from adjacent residential districts, and shall be concentrated on the
copy area of the sign.
      (4)    Internal illumination, if allowed, must be of sufficiently low
intensity as to not be subject to reasonable objections from neighboring
premises or uses. It is mandatory that the lettering or message be in
translucent materials and colors with the remainder of the sign opaque. The
internal illuminating source (bulbs, tubes, etc.) shall not be visible.
      (5)   Display signs illuminated by electricity, or equipped in any way
with electric devices or appliances, shall conform in wiring and appliances to
the provisions of the National Electrical Code, most current edition, and there
shall be a lock-type switch.
      (6)   In addition to meeting the Zoning Code requirements applicable to
signs generally, signs located in an Historic Area Conservation District shall
be compatible in color, material, placement, and character with the
architectural style of properties which reflect the district's history
specifically:
         A.   Illumination. Internally illuminated sign panels shall not be
permitted in such a district.
         B.   Sign types. Although no sign types are specifically prohibited by
this chapter, certain sign types may be deemed incompatible in particular
instances by the ABR. For example, the ABR might reject a particular proposal
for a prefabricated sign panel in favor of a sign lettered directly on a
building façade, window or canopy.
            (Ord. 77-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
   (f)   Indemnification and Insurance. All persons involved in the
maintenance, installation, alteration, or relocation of signs near or upon any
public right-of-way or property shall agree to hold harmless and indemnify the
City, its officers, agents, and employees, against any and all claims of
negligence resulting from such work insofar as this Code has not specifically
directed the placement of a sign.
   All persons involved in the maintenance, installation, alteration, or
relocation of signs shall maintain all required insurance and shall file with
the State a satisfactory certificate of insurance to indemnify the State,
County, or City against any form of liability.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1272.04 ZONING DISTRICT SIGNAGE REGULATIONS.
   All permitted signs shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements
of Section
1272.05.
   (a)   Signs Permitted in All Zones.
      (1)   Integral signs or monuments. Integral signs or monuments shall be
permitted, provided that the sign does not exceed two square feet in area and
is placed flat against, or is part of, a wall or other structural feature of
the premises. (Ord. 77-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
      (2)   Political signs. Political signs, not illuminated, meeting the
standards define in Section
1272.03(d)(1), shall be permitted.
      (3)   Real estate signs. (See Section
1272.03(d)(2).)
   (b)   Signs Permitted in D Dwelling Districts.
      (1)   Signs permitted without permits. Signs not requiring permits are,
specifically, garage sale signs, memorial signs or tablets, nameplates,
political signs, real estate signs, and security signs. These signs must meet
the guidelines of Section
 1272.03(c), and the referenced requirements therein. (Holiday or special event
decorations are also permitted without a permit.)
      (2)   Signs permitted but requiring permits.
         A.   Street numbers painted on curbing. If all property owners on both
sides of the right-of-way for an entire “block” (that is, from one intersection
to the next, or from an intersection to the end of a dead- end street) choose
to display their street numbers on the curb, they may do so, but they must
obtain a permit (at no cost) from the Zoning Administrator before such numbers
are put in place.
   The numbers must be painted on curbs with a permanent paint appropriate for
concrete. The numbers are to be of uniform size and of no more than four inches
nor less than three inches in height. The numbers must be black and they must
be on a painted white background that extends no more than three inches on
either side of the numbers.
         B.   Development or construction signs, temporary. (See Section
1272.03(d)(2)C.)
         C.   Development signs, permanent. (See Section
1272.03(d)(3)A.)
         D.   Building identification signs for multi-family developments. (See
Section
1272.03(d)(3)B )
         E.   Unit identification signs. In attached single-family
developments, each dwelling unit shall be permitted one wall sign identifying
the resident's name and address and not exceeding one square foot in area.
         F.   Churches, public schools, and private schools. For churches and
public and private schools that have been approved for these districts:
            1.    One bulletin board or announcement sign. See Section
1272.03(d)(4). Such signs may be illuminated, but only externally.
            2.    Two directional signs, if necessary.
         G.   Greenhouses and nurseries. For greenhouses and nurseries that
have been permitted for these districts:
            1.    One ground sign. (See Section
1272.03(d)(5) for special conditions.)
                a.   Maximum signage area allowed is thirty square feet.
                b.    Maximum height allowed is four feet.
               c.    Such signs may be illuminated, but only externally.
            2.    Two directional signs, if necessary.
   (c)   Signs Permitted in P-1 and P-2 Professional Districts.
      (1)   Functional types permitted. Identification signs, development signs
of a temporary nature, directional signs, nameplates, real estate signs,
security signs, and such other functional types as are specifically permitted
by this section, shall be permitted.
      (2)   Maximum number and area permitted. The number and area of signs
permitted for these districts are the same as for the Commercial Districts as
set forth in subsection (d) hereof, except that an identification sign for an
office or medical park may also be permitted.
      (3)   Identification signs for an office or medical park. In addition to
the signs permitted in this subsection, one “office park” or “medical park”
identification ground or pylon sign may be permitted for a unified development
of three or more buildings serviced by a common local access road. (See Section
1272.05(f).) (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (d)   Signs Permitted in C-1, C-2 and C-3 Commercial Districts. See Section
1272.05 for the design criteria for these signs.
      (1)   Functional types permitted. Business signs, identification signs,
development signs of a temporary nature, directional signs, nameplates, real
estate signs, security signs, and such other functional types of signs as are
specifically permitted by this section. (See Section
1272.03(d)(6) for gasoline service stations.)
      (2)   Maximum number permitted. The maximum number of permanent outdoor
signs allowed for a business is normally two: one wall sign, and one canopy
sign, but in addition, one free-standing sign, may be permitted if certain
conditions (listed in the next paragraph) are met. (In addition, both permanent
and temporary window signs are permitted.)
   If the width of either the primary building frontage (i.e. the frontage on
the street where the main entry faces), or a collection of building frontages
that comprise a shopping area, is greater than 100 feet, one free-standing sign
shall be permitted which may be either a ground sign or a pylon sign. If the
Architectural Board of Review determines that there are special circumstances
affecting a specific business on a particular corner lot such that a single
freestanding sign is not sufficient, two such signs may be permitted. If the
Architectural Board of Review determines that a projecting sign would clearly
complement a building’s architectural style and the surrounding area, one
projecting sign may also be permitted.
      (3)   Maximum areas permitted.  
         A.   The permitted “total sign face area” for permanent signs is the
sum of the face areas for a wall sign, plus a canopy sign, plus permanent
window sign (plus projecting sign, if permitted). The maximum total sign face
area permitted for each business is based on the frontage (i.e., on the street
where the main entry faces) of the primary building or business unit thereof
occupied by each business and is determined as follows:
            1.   Building width times 0.75 = total sign face area in square
feet. (But in all cases the sign face area shall not exceed sixty square feet.)
            2.   If the building occupies a corner lot, a twenty percent
increase in sign face area is permitted.
            3.   If a projecting sign is permitted by the Architectural Board
of Review, its area shall be included in the calculation of sign area being
requested by the business.
         B.   Free-standing sign, if permitted. The allowance for face area of
a free-standing sign (or signs), if permitted, is in addition to the permitted
total for signs determined in paragraph (d)(3)A., hereof. The maximum face area
is as follows:
            1.   The maximum face area for a ground sign is twenty-four square
feet and the maximum height is four feet.
            2.   The maximum face area for a pylon sign is thirty square feet
and the maximum height is eight feet.
         C.   Window signs; total area covered. No more than thirty percent of
the glass area (including clear areas of doors), calculated separately for each
side of the building, may be covered by any combination of signs, described
below, at any one time. The signs will be grouped, so far as possible, into one
quadrant of the glass area. (Signs of the types described in paragraphs (d)
(3)C.2. to 4. hereof, are not counted in the total area allowance of paragraph
(d)(3)A. hereof.)
            1.   Permanent window signs. Such signs shall not exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the glass area. Their area is included in the total of allowed
sign face area above.
               (Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
            2.    Temporary signs. Such signs may cover up to thirty percent of
the glass area. These signs may announce special business events, new products,
and sales, but not the prices of particular merchandise or services.
            3.    Non-profit activities. Ten percent of the glass area may be
used on a temporary basis, less than thirty days, to advertise non-profit
activities.
            4.    Credit cards and security signs. Signs displaying the credit
cards accepted by a business enterprise, and security signs, shall be
considered permanent window signs, and may only be of a type such as a sticker
or decal, which is readily affixed. Only one sign for each credit card accepted
shall be permitted at each entrance.
NOTE: The areas of windows not covered by signs shall provide a showcase for
products or present an attractive view of the interior of the premises
(uncluttered by the backsides of racks, shelves, machines, etc.) as judged by
the Architectural Board of Review. (See Section
1272.05(a).)
      (4)   Additional permitted signs. The sign face area and number of these
additional permitted signs are in addition to (not to be included in) the
allowed total describe above:
         A.   Development signs. See Sections
1272.03(d)(2)C. and
1272.03(d)(3)A.
         B.   Directional signs. Two directional signs.
         C.   Integral signs. One integral sign not to exceed two square feet
in area.
         D.   Nameplate signs. One nameplate not exceeding one square foot in
area for each store or office unit in the building, but not more than a total
of ten nameplates per building, shall be permitted.
         E.   Street numbers. Two street number signs not exceeding two square
feet in area shall be allowed. Such signs shall be permitted on mailboxes and
over doorways but shall otherwise be set back at least six feet from the
nearest property line and shall not be over four feet above natural grade.
         F.   Temporary signs.
            1.    Business unit sign. A temporary sign, in addition to those
permitted on the inside of the windows, may be displayed by a business unit
only if a temporary sign permit, which shall be subject to the following
requirements, has been obtained from the Zoning Administrator:
               a    The sign is for the announcement of the commencement of a
business or of a special event (not for the advertisement of products).
               b.    The permit shall be valid for no more than ten days.
               c.    A maximum of four temporary sign permits shall be issued
to an owner of a business in any one calendar year.
               d.    The sign must be made of durable material, and be no more
than eight square feet in size, nor more than four feet in overall height.
               e.    The sign must be located at least five feet from a public
right of way, and must not be located in walkways or parking areas so as to
jeopardize the safety or convenience of the public. They must be located no
more than five feet from the front or side wall of the business unit that they
describe or relate to.
               f.    A mobile or portable sign with changeable letters may be
used.
            2.    Group sponsored sign. The Architectural Board of Review may
approve a permit for a larger temporary sign for special or seasonal events for
a grouping of businesses who present an original sign design that is, in the
judgment of the Architectural Board of Review, innovative, creative, or
imaginative, and in keeping with the City's unique character and/or to promote
that concept.
               a.    Such temporary signs may be displayed for up to ten days.
               b.    A maximum of four such sign permits may be granted to any
one group per year.
               c.    The sign must be made of durable material, and be no more
than twenty square feet in size, nor more than six feet in overall height.
               d.    The sign must be located at least five feet from a public
right of way, and must not be located in walkways or parking areas so as to
jeopardize the safety or convenience of the public. The sign may, however, be
located in any other appropriate area that is under the control of the group of
businesses involved and that is approved by the Architectural Board of Review.
               e.    A mobile or portable sign with changeable letters may be
used.
   (e)   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (e) hereof was deleted by Ordinance
25-2016.)
   (f)   Signs Permitted in I-1 and I-2 Industrial Districts.
      (1)   Functional types permitted. Identification signs, directional
signs, nameplates, security signs, and real estate signs (including temporary
development signs).
      (2)   Identification signs.
         A.   Ground or pylon. One permanent ground or pylon identification
sign, indicating the building or occupant name only, shall be permitted on the
lot of each industrial use. (See Section
1272.05(d).)
         B.   Wall signs. One identification wall sign shall be permitted for
each separate use occupying a building. The maximum sign face area of all
permanent wall signs permitted for an industrial building shall, for single use
occupancy buildings, be directly related to the width of the building, or, for
multiple occupancy buildings, the width of each separate unit within the
building.
   The maximum sign face area of all wall signs shall not exceed .75 square
foot for each linear foot of building or building unit width. The maximum sign
face area of any permanent identification wall sign shall not exceed fifty
square feet.
   Wall signs shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of Section
1272.05(j).
         C.   Identification signs for industrial park. In addition to the
signs permitted in this section, one ground or pylon industrial park
identification sign shall be permitted for a unified development of three or
more industrial buildings serviced by a common local access road. (See Section

   (g)   Signs Permitted in Historic Area Conservation Districts.
      (1)   Signs shall be of an appropriate size, scale, shape, material,
color, texture, location, and illumination in relation to proposed structures
and the existing or proposed development, as well as adjacent property, as
determined by the Architectural Board of Review under Chapter
1444 and the Historic District Guidelines. Nothing herein shall be construed to
accord an applicant a right to a sign of a particular size, or height, or any
certain number of signs on premises within the Historic Area Conservation
District and thus within the special jurisdiction of the Architectural Board of
Review. In regard to temporary signs, the Board may relax the specific
regulations on such signs found elsewhere in this Zoning Code if the Board
judges that the requested signs are especially appropriate or characteristic of
the time in history represented by the District.
      (2)   If illumination is permitted, it shall be only from an exterior
source illumination by incandescent lighting fixtures.
         (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1272.05 DESIGN CRITERIA; CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Design Criteria. In addition to ensuring compliance with the
numerical standards of this Zoning Code, including those regarding the maximum
size, the Architectural Board of Review shall consider the proposed general
design arrangement and placement of signs as well as the appropriateness of the
proposed sign in relationship to other signs and other structures both on the
premises and in the surrounding areas, and shall approve only signs which are
consistent with the intent, purposes, standards and criteria of this chapter.
Specific standards for determining the appropriateness of signs shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The shape of the sign shall be simple and not create visual
clutter, and the sign should consist of a minimum number of elements.
      (2)   Letters, symbols, shapes, etc. shall be large enough to be easily
read but not overly large or out of scale with the building or site. (The
maximum lettering size for service station fuel prices is specifically noted in
Section
1272.03(d)(6)A ).
      (3)   A contrast between the message and the background shall permit easy
recognition of the message.
      (4)   The size, style, and location of the sign shall be appropriate to
the activity of the site.
      (5)   The sign shall complement the building and adjacent buildings by
being designed and placed to enhance the architecture. The sign shall also have
a minimum of advertising and reflect the primary purpose of identifying the
name and type of establishment.
      (6)   Signs shall be designed with a limited number of, and the
harmonious use of, colors.
      (7)   Extraneous elements, which may exist because of past inappropriate
remodeling, and which exist at the time a new sign is proposed shall be removed
to improve the clarity and design of the proposed sign and restore the intended
character of the building.
      (8)   Signs, if seen in series, shall have a continuity of design, with
the style of the signs generally consistent throughout the building or block.
      (9)   Directional signs shall contain the minimum information and make
use of the minimum area necessary to convey the message and instruct the viewer
in the safe and efficient use of the facility.
      (10)   Visible frames or supports for projecting signs shall be artistic
in nature.
      (11)   A sign should be constructed with a minimum of different types of
materials so as to provide a consistent overall appearance.
      (12)   The areas of windows of businesses not covered by signs shall
provide a showcase for products or present an esthetically attractive view of
the interior of the premises as judged by the Architectural Board of Review.
(The view will not, for example, show or expose the back side of product
shelving, or equipment.) If the window area is not to provide an attractive
view, the owner may propose a method to cover the windows to meet the esthetic
requirement as judged by the Architectural Board of Review.
   
   (b)   Canopy Sign. One canopy sign may be made a part of the fascia of a
canopy over an entrance/exit of each business or office use, provided the total
area of one face of the sign does not exceed eight square feet, the vertical
dimension of the sign does not exceed twelve inches, the horizontal dimension
of the sign does not exceed ninety-six inches and the lowest structural member
is not less than eight feet above the sidewalk grade. Such a canopy sign shall
be painted or surface mounted only onto the facing edge of the canopy. Canopy
signs may be placed on the vertical faces of a canopy or marquee but shall not
be permitted where the canopy or marquee projects over any public right-of-way.
   (c)   Directional Signs. If deemed necessary, two directional signs of
permanent construction indicating traffic routes within parking areas or
driveways, each not exceeding four square feet in total area per side and four
feet in height above natural grade, shall be permitted at any entrance/exit to
any building or lot, provided that no part of the sign or the support thereof
is located less than two feet from any lot line.
   (d)   Ground or Pylon Sign. One ground sign, not to exceed twenty-four
square feet in total area per side and four feet in height above the natural
grade, or one pylon sign, not to exceed thirty square feet in total area and
eight feet in height above the natural grade, shall be permitted subject to the
requirements herein, unless a smaller size is specifically permitted in Section
1272.04. For either sign, the lowest horizontal structural member shall be no
more than twenty- four inches above the ground. Any permitted ground or pylon
sign shall be located no closer than five feet from any lot line or access
drive or twenty-five feet from a residential district or residence lot. Such
signs shall be located on the same lot as the business or service to which it
directs attention. Supporting columns and structural trim may be used, but in
the event the face area of such supports and/or trim exceed twenty-five percent
of the sign face area, the sign face area shall be reduced in size by the
amount of the excess.
   (e)   Industrial Park Identification Sign. One industrial park
identification ground or pylon sign shall be permitted for a unified
development of three or more industrial buildings serviced by a common local
access road. Such sign shall identify only the name and address of the
industrial park. The maximum single-face sign area shall be thirty square feet.
A ground sign shall not exceed five feet in height and a pylon sign ten feet in
height. Such sign shall be located at the vehicular entrance to the industrial
park and shall be set back a minimum of thirty-five feet from the nearest
street right-of-way line and from the nearest edge of the pavement of a private
drive.
   (f)   Office or Medical Park Identification Signs. One office park or
medical park identification ground or pylon sign may be permitted for a unified
development of three or more industrial buildings serviced by a common local
access road. Such sign shall only identify the name and address of the park.
The maximum single face sign area shall not exceed thirty square feet. A ground
sign shall not exceed five feet in height and a pylon sign ten feet in height.
Such sign shall be located at the vehicular entrance to the industrial park and
shall be set back a minimum of thirty-five feet from the nearest street right-
of-way line and the nearest edge of pavement of a private drive.
   (g)   Pole Signs. It is the intention of this Zoning Code to eliminate the
use of pole signs in the City of Olmsted Falls.
   (h)   Projecting Sign. One projecting sign for each business establishment
not exceeding nine square feet in area for each face may be permitted as a
substitute for part of the allotment of wall sign area and subject to the
regulations herein. Use of projecting signs shall be limited to applications
which clearly complement a building's architectural style and that of the
surrounding area, as determined by the Architectural Board of Review.
   Such signs shall be attached to the wall and shall project no more than
three feet therefrom at an angle of not less than ninety degrees. Projecting
signs shall be fixed in place and not allowed to swing from any bar, crane,
awning or other sign. Such signs shall not obstruct the windows or doors of any
building; be attached to or obstruct a fire escape; or otherwise be in conflict
with any safety provisions of the Building Code. A projecting sign shall
project from the building occupied by the business or service to which it
directs attention and may extend above the top of the wall to which it is
attached, provided that no more than thirty-five percent of the total height of
the sign extends above the wall. No face of a projecting sign shall be less
than five feet from a side lot line or party wall of any other store or unit
and no projecting sign shall be closer than twenty-five feet to any other
projecting sign. If the sign is over a walkway, its lowest structural member
shall be not less than eight feet above the walkway grade.
   If the sign is over a public walkway, it will require the approval of the
Mayor or his or her designee, who shall certify that the position does not
violate legal or safety requirements.
   (i)   Pylon Sign. See subsection (d) hereof.
   (j)   Wall Signs. A wall sign shall not project more than twelve inches from
the building wall to which it is attached and shall be set back from the end of
the building or any party wall lines by a distance of at least three feet and
shall not project beyond any corner or above the coping or eaves of any
building. No wall sign shall be situated within a window or part of a window,
nor shall its supporting structure cover any window or part of any window. Wall
signs placed in the vertical space between windows shall not exceed a height of
two-thirds of the distance between the top of a lower window and the sill of
the window above or the major architectural details related thereto. No wall
sign shall extend above the roof line or the top of a parapet wall. No wall
sign shall wholly or partly cover any wall opening or prevent free egress or
ingress from any door, window or fire escape. Wall signs shall be attached to
or integral with a wall occupied by a permitted business or activity. No wall
sign shall be painted directly on the wall, unless specifically permitted by
the Architectural Board of Review. If there is an architectural space intended
for signage, wall signs shall be designed to fit within that space.
   (k)   Construction Standards and Compliance With Codes.
      (1)   The construction, erection, and safety aspects of signs shall
comply with the Building and Housing Code of the City of Olmsted Falls.
      (2)   Signs shall be structurally sound and located so as to pose no
threat to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (3)   Signs shall be fabricated on and of material which is of good
quality, good durability, and complementary to the building of which they
become a part.
      (4)   Sign shall be structurally designed to withstand wind pressure of
thirty pounds per square foot in any direction.
   (l)   Maintenance. All signs shall be properly maintained. Exposed surfaces
shall be clean and painted surfaces shall be maintained. Defective parts shall
be replaced. The Zoning Administrator shall have the right under Sections
1272.06(d), and
1272.07(g) and (h) to order the repair or removal of any sign which is
defective, damaged, or substantially deteriorated, as defined in the Building
and Housing Code.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1272.06 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Removal of Nonconforming Signs. Signs that are legal but nonconforming
(see subsection (b) hereof) may remain in place, but must be made conforming or
be removed within two years of the effective date of this Zoning Code, unless
one of the circumstances described in subsection (c) or (d) hereof has occurred
prior to that date. All other signs that do not conform are illegal and must be
removed.
   (b)   Determination of Legal Nonconformity. Existing signs that do not
conform to the specific provisions of this Zoning Code shall be eligible for
the designation "legal but nonconforming" if:
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator determines that such signs are properly
maintained and do not in any way endanger the public; and
      (2)   The sign was in place in conformance with a valid permit or
variance, or complied with all applicable laws on the date of adoption of this
Zoning Code.
   
   (c)   Loss of “Legal but Nonconforming” Status. A legal but nonconforming
sign shall lose this designation if one or more of the following occur:
      (1)   The sign is relocated or replaced;
      (2)   The structure or size of the sign is altered in any way except
toward compliance with this chapter; and/or
      (3)   The use to which the sign is accessory is vacant for ninety
successive days.
   (d)   Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Signs. A legal but
nonconforming sign is subject to all requirements of this Zoning Code regarding
safety, maintenance, and repair. However, if the sign suffers damage or
deterioration to an extent that exceeds fifty percent of its replacement value
at the time of destruction, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, it shall
be reconstructed or repaired only in conformance with this Zoning Code or must
be removed.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1272.07 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Code Administrator. This chapter shall be administered and enforced by
the City's Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Application for Permits. For those signs requiring a permit, the
application for a permit shall include the following items:
      (1)   The name and address of the owner of the sign;
      (2)   The street address or location of the property on which the sign is
to be located, along with the name and address of the property owner;
      (3)   The type of sign or sign structure as defined in this chapter;
      (4)   A site plan with measurements showing the proposed location of the
sign along with the locations of all existing signs on the same and adjacent
premises;
      (5)   A delineation of appropriate items of information, including, as a
minimum the design and layout of the proposed sign, including all dimensions,
the colors of the exposed materials and surfaces, the method of illumination,
the electrical components of the sign structure, and the construction details
as required by the Building and Housing Code;
   The Architectural Board of Review, at its discretion, may either add items
or waive the submission of items that it deems appropriate.
   (c)   Permit Fees. All applications for permits filed with the Zoning
Administrator shall be accompanied by payment of the initial permit fee for
each sign as required by the City Council.
   (d)   Issuance and Denial; Referral of the Application to the Architectural
Board of Review.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator, upon receiving the properly completed
application for a sign permit, shall examine all elements in the application
and the premises upon which it is proposed to erect the sign or other
advertising structure. If it appears that the proposed sign is in compliance
with this chapter and all other ordinances of the City, the application shall
be referred (within five days of his or her receipt of the completed
application) to the Secretary of the Architectural Board of Review (or the
appropriate designee) to schedule the review of the application by the Board.
The approval of the Architectural Board of Review must be obtained before the
permit is issued. In all applications, where a matter of interpretation arises,
the more specific definition or higher standard shall prevail. If the
Architectural Board of Review has not acted upon the sign application within
thirty days of the receipt of the application by the Secretary of the
Architectural Board of Review (or the appropriate designee), the application
may be assumed to have been denied.
      (2)   When approved by the Board, the application shall be returned to
the Zoning Administrator, who shall then issue the permit. If the work
authorized by a sign permit has not been completed within six months after the
date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void.
      (3)   When an application for a permit is denied, either by the Zoning
Administrator or the Architectural Board of Review, the Zoning Administrator
shall provide a written notice to the applicant along with a brief description
of the reasons for the denial, citing Zoning Code sections where appropriate.
The Zoning Administrator may suspend or revoke an issued permit for any false
statement or misrepresentation of fact in the application.
   (e)   Permit Conditions; Refunds; Penalties.
      (1)   If an application for a permit is denied, the permit fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
      (2)   If any sign is installed or placed on any property prior to receipt
of a permit, the specified permit fee shall be doubled. However, payment of the
doubled fee shall not relieve any person of any other requirements or penalties
prescribed in this chapter.
   (f)   Inspection Upon Completion. Any person installing, structurally
altering, or relocating a sign for which a permit has been issued shall notify
the Zoning Administrator upon completion of the work. There shall be a final
inspection by the Zoning Administrator, including an electrical inspection, if
applicable, and an inspection of footings for free-standing signs.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (g)   Procedure Upon Violations. When, in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator, a violation of this Zoning Code chapter exists, he or she shall
issue a written order to the alleged violator. The order shall specify those
sections of this Zoning Code chapter which the individual may be in violation
of, and shall state that the individual has five days from the date of the
order in which to correct the alleged violation or to appeal to the appropriate
board or body.
   If, upon inspection, the Zoning Administrator finds that a sign is abandoned
or structurally, materially, or electrically defective, or in any way endangers
the public, he or she shall issue a written order to the owner of the sign and
to the occupant of the premises stating the nature of the violation and
requiring them to repair or remove the sign.
   Nothing in this Code shall prohibit City personnel from removing signs from
the right-of- way that have been erected without City approval and/or in a
manner that is potentially hazardous to the public.
   In case of an emergency, the Zoning Administrator may cause the immediate
removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice. Signs may be removed
in this manner only if they present a hazard to the public safety, as defined
in the Building and Housing Code, or in the Traffic Code. (Ord. 75-2005. Passed
10-11-05.)
   (h)   Removal of Signs; Payment of Costs. The Zoning Administrator may cause
the removal of an illegal sign in the case of an emergency, or when a written
order for its removal or repair has been disregarded. After removal or
demolition of a sign in such cases, a notice shall be mailed to the sign owner
stating the nature of the work and the date on which it was performed and
demanding payment of the costs of removal as certified by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (1)   If the amount specified in the notice is not paid within forty-five
days of the receipt of the notice, a citation to appear in Mayor's Court shall
be issued.
      (2)   The owner of the property upon which the sign is located shall be
presumed to be the owner of all signs thereon unless facts to the contrary are
brought to the attention of the Zoning Administrator, as in the case of a
leased sign.
      (3)   For purposes of removal, “a sign” shall be understood to include
all sign embellishments and structures designed specifically to support the
sign.
         (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   
   (i)   Appeals. If an application for a sign permit is denied by the
Architectural Board of Review, appeal procedures listed in Section
1444.08 shall apply. If a permit is denied by the Zoning Administrator, an
applicant may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Section
1232.07. (Ord. 77-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)

1274.01 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   The following landscaping and screening requirements are established to
provide for landscaping and visual screening which will improve the
environmental quality of the community by preventing soil erosion and
maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management; remove,
reduce, or absorb the impact between one incompatible use or zoning district
and another; and obscure the view of outdoor parking, waste receptacles, and
outdoor storage. This section is in addition to the setback and yard
requirements provided elsewhere in this Code.
   (a)   Landscaping of Areas not Covered by Buildings and Parking Lots.
Required yards and all other portions of the lot not covered by permitted
structures or permitted impervious surface material shall be landscaped with
grass, trees, shrubbery, and/or other appropriate ground cover or landscaping
materials, which at all times shall be maintained in good and healthy
condition.
   (b)   Tree Preservation and Management. In all districts, trees shall be
provided, preserved, and protected during construction in compliance with the
provisions of Chapter
1218.
   (c)   General Screening Requirements. The following requirements shall be
considered the minimum requirements for the installation of all required
landscaping and screening elements:
      (1)   Screening materials. When the existing vegetation on the site does
not form a solid, continuous visual screen with the minimum height required in
subsections below, additional screening elements shall be provided. Such
additional elements shall be comprised of one or more of the following, and the
configuration of the required screening elements shall be in a manner that
maximizes the screening effect as determined by the Planning Commission:
         A.   A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees and/or shrubs, of
a variety(ies) which form a solid, continuous visual screen that will be
equally effective in winter and summer.
         B.   A non-living opaque structure such as a solid masonry wall or
solidly constructed decorative fence.
         C.   A landscaped mound or berm with no more than a 3:1 slope.
      (2)   Height of screening. Screening materials shall comply with the
height requirements specified for the type of screening, as specified below.
      (3)   Performance. When screening is comprised solely of new landscaping
materials, the desired screening effect shall be achieved no later than twelve
months after the initial installation.
      (4)   Signs. All screening material shall be free of advertising or other
signs, except for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of
vehicles.
      (5)   Location. The location of the required screening elements shall be
such as to maximize the screening effect and shall be approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (6)   Landscape plan. All new and expanded uses or site renovations shall
be permitted only after review of the Landscape Plan, as part of the
requirements for development plans outlined in Section
1232.06.
   (d)   Screening Requirements Between Districts. When a lot in a C or I
District abuts a D, P, or MUPD District, or dwelling in a C-3 District,
screening along the entire length of the common boundary shall be provided in
accordance with the following regulations. The Planning Commission, after
review as outlined in Section
1232.04, may require that conditional uses in residential districts be screened
in accordance with these regulations.
      (1)   Screening Materials. Materials used for screening shall comply with
the requirements set forth in Section
1274.01(d)(1).
      (2)   Height of Screening.
         A.   Screening of Lots in Commercial Districts. Visual screening
walls, fences, mounds, vegetation, or such items in combination, shall be a
minimum of six feet in height, except for fences and walls in front yards,
which shall comply with Section
1274.03(a).
         B.   Screening of Lots in Industrial Districts. Visual screening
walls, fences, mounds, vegetation, or such items in combination as determined
by the Planning Commission to be most effective, shall be a minimum of eight
feet in height or the minimum height needed to screen the materials and/or
equipment from the view of any observer standing at grade level at the abutting
lot line, as determined by the Planning Commission, except that fences and
walls in front yards shall comply with Section
1274.03(a).
   (e)   Screening and Landscaping Requirements for Parking Lots.
      (1)   Landscaping on the Interior of Parking Lots. Interior landscaping
of parking lots shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements
(this provision does not apply unless more than two rows of parking are
provided):
         A.   For any parking area designed to accommodate forty or more
vehicles, a minimum of five percent of the parking lot shall be planted and
landscaped islands.
            1.   Landscaped islands shall be developed and distributed
throughout the parking lot to:
               a.   Define major circulation aisles and driving lanes; and
               b.   Provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of
pavement.
            2.   Each island shall be a minimum of ten feet in any horizontal
dimension.
            3.   Within the landscaped islands, one shade tree shall be
provided for every ten parking spaces. Each tree, at the time of installation,
shall have a minimum caliper of two inches and a minimum of at least five feet
below the lowest branches.
            4.   Shrubs or low, spreading, plant materials shall be planted
within required landscaped islands in such a way that there is not impairment
to the visibility of motorists or pedestrians.

the site and that the proposed location is available for viewing by abutting
neighbors, whereupon the Building Department shall send a notice by regular
mail to the adjacent property owners giving them ten business days to file a
written objection to the staked location with the Building Department. If no
written objection is received within ten business days, the fence permit shall
be issued subject to execution by the applicant of a certification
acknowledging that they are responsible for ensuring that the fence is on their
property and that the issuance of the fence permit authorizes construction of
the fence but does not guarantee or certify the location relative to the
property lines. (Email will be considered written objection provided it is sent
to the Building Department.)
            2.   If more than 5 feet from the property line, there are special
location requirements.
         B.   Along Public Walks. A barrier along a public sidewalk shall be
placed at least two feet from the inside edge of the sidewalk.

as well as the space between such fence, wall, hedge, or similar barrier and
the lot line of an adjoining property, shall be kept in good maintenance and
repair so as not to have a detrimental effect on surrounding properties, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (c)   Plans and Permits Required. Any proposed fence, wall, hedge, or
similar barrier that is to be installed at the time of a construction requiring
a development plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission as
part of that development plan, as set forth in Section
1232.06. However, when a fence or wall is proposed at a separate time from any
development or any new construction, additions, or site renovations, a fence or
wall may be approved by the Zoning Administrator, provided that the applicant
has (1) provided a detailed project plan showing that the requirements of this
section have been met, and (2) completed a permit application and paid the fees
per Chapter
1448.

      •   Uplighting wastes energy into the sky.
      •   Causes glare, light trespass and harsh illumination.
      •   Uplighting is sometimes ineffective.
 
   (c)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specifically permitted, all outdoor lighting
fixtures, including but not limited to those used for streets, parking areas,
buildings, signs/billboards, displays, and landscaping, shall be full cut-off
type fixtures. Fixtures for building overhangs and canopies shall be recessed.
      (2)   These full-cutoff fixtures shall be installed and maintained so
that the shielding is effective as described in subsection (b)(2) above.
      (3)   Signs wholly illuminated from within are acceptable, except within
the Historic District, and do not require shielding.
      (4)   Uplighting shall be prohibited, except that the Architectural Board
of Review may approve directed uplighting to decoratively highlight buildings.
      (5)   Automobile-oriented uses such as gasoline stations, service
stations, and drive-through facilities shall install recessed ceiling fixtures
in any canopy.
   (d)   Light Trespass. Light trespass over a property line shall be limited
to no more than 0.5 footcandle at the property line. All on-site lighting of
buildings, lawns, parking areas, and signs shall be designed so as not to shine
onto any adjacent property or building, or to cause glare that projects onto
any public street or into any vehicle thereon.
   (e)   Measurement.
      (1)   Light levels shall be measured in footcandles with a direct-
reading, portable light meter. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has
been exposed long enough to take a constant reading.
      (2)   Measurements shall be taken at the property line, along a
horizontal plane at a height of three and one-half feet above the ground.
      (3)   Light poles shall not exceed a height of twenty (20) feet.
   (f)   Exemptions.
      (1)   Decorative outdoor lighting fixtures with bulbs of less than 25
watts, installed seasonally, are exempt from the requirements of Section
1274.16.
      (2)   Temporary construction or emergency lighting is exempt from the
requirements of Section
1274.16 provided such lighting is discontinued immediately upon completion of
the construction work or abatement of the emergency necessitating said
lighting.
      (3)   All outdoor lighting fixtures existing and legally installed prior
to the effective date of this amendment are exempt from the requirements of
Section
1274.16. When existing lighting fixtures become inoperative for a period of 90
days, their replacements are subject to the provisions of this subsection.
      (4)   Nothing in Section
1274.16 shall apply to lighting required by the FAA or any other federal
regulatory authority.

1280.01 PURPOSE.
   In accordance with the General Laws of the State of Ohio, the lawful
establishment of nonconforming uses, buildings, lots, and structures is herein
recognized by providing for the continuance of nonconforming status subject to
the regulations which limit their completion, restoration, reconstruction and
extension, and substitution for them. While it is the intent of this Zoning
Code to permit such nonconforming status to continue until abandoned, removed,
or abated, a nonconforming status is considered to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the zoning district in which it exists and with the
Comprehensive Plan of the City and should be discouraged. It is further the
intent of this Zoning Code that any nonconforming use, building, or structure
shall not be reconstructed, enlarged, restored, expanded, or extended, except
in accordance with the regulations contained in this chapter. Further, the
continuation of a lawful nonconforming status shall not be construed as a
reason to permit additions to such nonconforming status not specifically
permitted by this chapter.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.02 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   Any lot in a single-family dwelling district, which was lawful at the
time this Planning and Zoning Code became effective, but which does not conform
to area and/or width requirements, may be improved with a single-family
dwelling even though lot width and lot depth requirements are not met, provided
that all other requirements, including the required front, side and rear yard
dimensions for the district in which the lot is located, are met.
   (b)   Any lot in a multi-family dwelling district or in a non-residential
district existing lawfully at the time this Planning and Zoning Code became
effective, but which does not conform to area and/or width requirements may be
improved with a building, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements
not involving area and width conform to the regulations for the district in
which the lot is located. The improvement of any lot in a multi-family dwelling
district or in a non-residential district shall be subject to review by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with Section
1206.05. 
(Ord. 89-99. Passed 12-14-99; Ord. 64-2019. Passed 9-10-19.)
1280.03 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   The use of a building or land, or a building and land in combination,
existing lawfully on the passage date of this Planning and Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, but which does not conform to the use regulations of the
district in which it is located, is a lawful nonconforming use. A nonconforming
use may continue in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration. No existing building or structure occupied by a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or structurally
altered, except to change the use of such building or structure to a use that
is permitted in such district.
   (b)   Extension. Any nonconforming use may be extended only throughout parts
of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the
passage date of this Planning and Zoning Code or any amendment thereto, but no
such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   Substitution. A nonconforming use shall only be changed to a
conforming use, except that, when no structural alterations are made, the
Planning Commission may approve the substitution of another nonconforming use,
provided the proposed nonconforming use is less in conflict with the character
and intent of the zoning district in which the use is located and no more
noxious to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the Commission may impose appropriate conditions and safeguards to
protect adjacent properties. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a
more restricted use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use.
   (d)   Resumption. Whenever a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted
use, such permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which such use is located. Any nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be resumed.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
   (e)   Accessory, Incidental, or Subordinate Use. An accessory, incidental,
or subordinate use, lawfully operating together with either a lawful principal
use or a lawful nonconforming principal use, may continue in the district so
long as it remains accessory, incidental, or subordinate to that principal use.
Accessory, incidental, and subordinate uses may not be modified, expanded,
relocated, or transferred unless such changes are made in full compliance with
this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of a lot, building, or
structure, or of a building or structure and premises in combination, is
discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve consecutive months, the lot,
building, or structure, or building or structure and premises in combination,
shall not thereafter be used, except in conformity with the regulations for the
district in which it is located.
      (Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 75-2005. Passed 10-11-05.)
1280.04 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   A building or structure existing lawfully on the passage date of this
Planning and Zoning Code, but which no longer conforms to this Code with
respect to yards, height, lot coverage, or other regulations, standards, or
requirements concerning such building or structure, may continue, except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Code, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration. No such building or structure shall be enlarged or altered
in such a way so as to increase its nonconformity. However, a structure or
portion thereof may be altered, added to, or enlarged, provided such
alteration, addition, or enlargement conforms to all yard regulations.
   (b)   Destruction. Any nonconforming building or structure destroyed by
fire, flood, wind, or other act of God, or is deliberately dismantled or
destroyed to an extent that exceeds fifty percent of its replacement value at
the time of such destruction shall only be reconstructed in conformity with
this Zoning Code, except as provided herein:
      (1)   Single-family dwellings destroyed by fire, flood, wind, or other
act of God may be rebuilt on the same foundation, provided that such rebuilt
single-family dwelling cannot be made to conform to this Zoning Code; and
      (2)   Any structure or building that is nonconforming solely as a result
of failure to comply with a riparian or wetland setback pursuant to Chapter
1470 may be reconstructed in the same location and setback.
   (c)   Relocation. Should the building or structure be moved for any reason,
for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for
the district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (d)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97; Ord. 68-2019. Passed 9-24-19.)
1280.05 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   A building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use may have
repair and maintenance work done to walls, floors, ceilings, roofs, fixtures,
wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content of such building is not
increased.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building, or part thereof, that is
declared to be unsafe by the Zoning Administrator, or by any other official
charged with protecting the public safety, upon the order of such official.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.06 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Zoning Code, or any amendment
thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to the sign
regulations of the district in which it is located, is a nonconforming sign.
Nonconforming signs shall be regulated in accordance with Section
1272.06.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.07 NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became effective, but which does not conform with the off-
street parking regulations of this Code, may be occupied by the existing use
without such parking facilities being provided. However, if the existing
building is occupied by a use which results in an increase in the required
number of off-street parking spaces, then the additional off-street parking
spaces shall be provided so that the nonconforming parking condition is not
increased.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.08 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and the use of nonconforming buildings for which a certificate of
zoning compliance has been issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Code, or any amendment thereto, provided that construction is commenced within
ninety days after such effective date and is completed within one year after
the issuance of the zoning certificate.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.09 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Any use lawfully existing prior to the passage of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, which is listed as a conditional use in the district in
which it is located, shall be considered a nonconforming use when such use is
not in full compliance with the conditions for such use specified in Chapter
1264. A conditional use certificate shall be obtained for any change,
modification, enlargement, or alteration of such use, including changes to the
building, parking area, level of operation, or signs.
(Ord. 24-97. Passed 10-14-97.)
1280.10 ILLEGAL USES.
   Any use that was placed or was operating illegally under the previous Zoning
Code shall continue to be deemed illegal after the effective date of this
Zoning Code and shall not be construed to be conforming unless such use
specifically meets the requirements of the district in which it is located.

1430.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and all related Codes and Referenced Standards as adopted by the Ohio Board of
Building Standards and as may be amended and updated from time to time,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3781.10 and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
(Ord. 02-2016. Passed 1-26-16.)
1430.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (Ord. 02-2016. Passed 1-26-16.)
1430.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and

notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that

   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an

matter specified in the order.

regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation

rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the

1444.06 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW.
   (a)   The Architectural Board of Review shall base its actions on a
consideration of the impact of the proposed building or other feature upon
existing man-made or natural resources in the general area. The Board shall
base its recommendations concerning land use on a consideration of the relation
of a use to the natural features of the land, the appropriate maintenance of
open areas, the potential impact upon nearby historic resources, the aesthetics
of building location and other factors it deems important. The Board shall
disapprove (or recommend disapproval where the Board has an advisory function)
of applications it finds will not be compatible with the existing character of
other properties in the City or if it finds that the granting of such
application will have an adverse effect on the tax value of such other
properties.
   (b)   The following standards are established to guide the Board in its
review of, and actions pertaining to, all structures:
      (1)   Materials shall be appropriate:
         A.   For use in the proposed structures;
         B.   With respect to the weathering of existing materials; and
         C.   In their relationship to other materials, including those used on
adjacent structures.
      (2)   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of
proposed structures, weathering and the relationship to other colors and
textures, including those used on adjacent structures.
      (3)   Architectural details and ornamentation shall be meaningful to the
overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of proposed structures,
weathering and the relationship to other architectural details and
ornamentation, including those used on adjacent structures.
      (4)   Mechanical equipment shall be of appropriate size and scale in
relation to rooftop appearance, sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke and
other nuisances. Mechanical equipment shall also be properly related to
overhead wires, gas and electric meter stations and any other visible
appurtenances.
      (5)   Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be of appropriate size
and scale in relation to the appearance of the proposed development from public
rights of way, adjacent property and the site itself. The relationship of
paving to proposed structures and developments shall also be appropriate,
considering factors such as safety, drainage and landscaping.
      (6)   Grading shall be appropriate in relation to the appearance of all
structures, and the existing or proposed structures and developments shall also
be appropriate, considering factors such as safety, drainage and landscaping.
      (7)    Orientation of proposed structures shall be appropriate in
relation to proposed grading, natural features and existing structures on and
adjacent to the site, as well as to sunlight, predominant winds, traffic and
parking areas.
      (8)   Landscaping shall be appropriate for the size, scale and use of
proposed structures and the existing or proposed development, and for the
relationship between such proposed structures and existing structures and the
existing or proposed development, public rights of way, parking areas, walks,
grading and natural features. In addition, landscaping shall be appropriately
hardy according to accepted horticultural standards for northeast Ohio.
      (9)   Lighting shall be appropriate in relation to the illumination of
proposed structures and the existing or proposed development, parking areas,
rights of way and walks and with respect to its effect upon surrounding areas.
      (10)   Signs shall be of appropriate size, scale, shape, material, color,
texture and illumination in relation to proposed structures and the existing or
proposed development, as well as to adjacent property.
      (11)   Other structural features and appurtenances, such as fences,
walks, paved areas, light standards, displays and storage areas, shall be
appropriate in relation to other proposed or existing structures and/or the
existing or proposed development.
   (c)   The following standards are established to guide the Board in its
review of, and actions pertaining to, all Designated Historic Buildings,
Landmarks and Structures within the City and for all structures within the
Historic Districts:
      (1)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for property which requires minimal alteration of the building structure or
site and its environment, or to use the property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall
be avoided where possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired, rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary the new
material shall match the material being replaced in composition, design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features,
substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken using the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting or other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be used.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy a significant historical, architectural or cultural material and when
such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character
of the property, neighborhood or environment.
      (10)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be made in such a manner that, should such additions or alterations be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
remain unimpaired.
      (11)   Materials, colors, textures, architectural details and
ornamentation shall be appropriate for the environment in which any proposed
new construction is to occur, taking into account the presence of similar
features in nearby properties.
      (12)   In addition to meeting the Zoning Code requirements applicable to
signs generally, signs located in Historic Districts shall conform to the
standards of this section. Internally illuminated sign panels shall not be
permitted in Historic Districts. There are additional specific restrictions in
the Design Guidelines (attached to Ordinance 23-2021, passed March 23, 2021,
and incorporated herein by reference) for types of signs that may be deemed
incompatible by the Board. For example, the Board might reject a proposal for a
prefabricated sign panel in favor of a sign lettered directly on a building
facade, window or canopy.
   (d)   These specific guidelines adopted by City Council by Ordinance 23-2021
on March 23, 2021 shall be applied as the standards in the Board review for
both subsections (b) and (c) hereof.
(Ord. 78-2008. Passed 1-27-09; Ord. 24-2021. Passed 4-13-21.)
1444.07 REGULAR AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   The owner of a designated landmark or of any structure within an
Historic District, whether such structure is inhabited or vacant, shall provide
sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to insure its perpetuation
and to prevent its destruction by deterioration.
   (b)   The Board may, on its own initiative, file a petition with the
Building, Housing and Zoning Administrator requesting that the Administrator
proceed to take action against any owner who, in the opinion of the Board, is
in violation of subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the delay of
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of a structure or feature that has
been ordered by the Building, Housing and Zoning Administrator upon
certification of an unsafe condition constituting an emergency.
The Administrator shall, however, insofar as emergency conditions permit,
contact the Chairperson of the Board for information and guidance prior to
making any emergency decision.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or regulate
routine maintenance activities that do not require an alteration in appearance.
(Ord. 78-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1444.08 APPEALS TO COUNCIL
   Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Architectural Board of
Review may, within thirty days after such decision is rendered, appeal to
Council. The Board shall provide Council with reasons for their decision and
for denials, what changes to the application may result in approval. After
reviewing the Board's decision, Council may reverse or modify the decision by a
vote of a two-thirds majority of members elected to Council.
(Ord. 78-2008. Passed 1-27-09.)
1444.09 DESIGN GUIDELINES AND HISTORIC DESIGN GUIDELINES.

1469.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of stormwater
management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community.
   (b)   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream
flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that are caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control stormwater runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume, rate of
storm water runoff, and characteristics of the runoff originating from their
property so that surface water and ground water are protected, soil erosion is
controlled, and flooding potential is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that stormwater controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and stormwater
management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion, sediment
and stormwater control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate stormwater, erosion and sediment control.
      (11)   Require the construction of stormwater management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all stormwater management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale Barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)   Stormwater Diversion Practices: Stormwater diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Stormwater diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and stormwater control SCMs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Stormwater
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:

                                        Engineer shall then inspect the lot to
                                        ensure that the Temporary Seeding has
                                        been done.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability
or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: A sediment settling pond is required for any
one of the following conditions:
   •   Concentrated stormwater runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
   •   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of silt
fence or other sediment barriers;
   •   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet
protection; or
   •   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of disturbed
land.
   •   Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in writing, that
the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner demonstrated to be
equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 5
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principle) spillway. Or the storage volume of the sediment storage zone shall
be the volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with Revised
Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) or other generally accepted erosion
prediction model.
      (3)   Permanent stormwater management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 48 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is
recommended.
      (5)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
      (9)   When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used
as temporary sediment trapping SCMs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual shall be utilized during
construction phase and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the
City.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer & Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer drains,
roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom of the
slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being
drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the
stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is
outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to surface waters
of the state, structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to
protect the adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
      (5)   Based on site conditions, Community Engineer may require additional
SCMs to control off site tracking and dust. These additional SCMs may include:
         A.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         B.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the a sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with this regulation. No
surfactants or detergents may be used to wash vehicles.
         C.   Owners shall take an necessary measures to comply with applicable
regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining necessary
permits for such emissions. The Community Engineer may require dust controls
including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles,
temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of
vehicles on the site.
   (n)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions. No non- native invasive species shall be used in any
vegetative stabilization seed mix.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable.
The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the owner from meeting
the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
      (4)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include: i) the inspection date; ii) names, titles, and
qualifications of personnel making the inspection; iii) weather information for
the period since the last inspection including the timing, duration, and depth
of any storms; iv) weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of the inspection; v) location(s) of discharges of
sediment or other pollutants from the site; vi) location(s) of SCMs that need
to be maintained; vii) location(s) of SCMs that failed to operate as designed
or proved inadequate for a particular location; viii) location(s) where
additional SCMs are needed that did not exist at the time of the inspection;
and, ix) corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates.
      (5)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (6)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
      (7)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (8)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (9)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (11)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that the remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (13)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (14)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this ordinance it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (15)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community’s and state’s water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster,
drywall, grout, gypsum and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for
the proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   Concrete Washout: The washing of excess concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not
occur. A designated area for concrete washouts shall be made available and used
for all concrete washouts.
      (3)   Vehicle Fluids: All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a
marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with
a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the
storage area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be
followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained “dike,” the plug will be kept
in the “dike” tank at all times.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous wastes
and/or contaminated soils must be disposed of according to all applicable
environmental laws and statutes. Local health districts and Ohio EPA can
provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   Fuel and Liquid Tank Storage: On a site with a prior industrial
landuse or a site that is contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon
based chemicals or other Ohio EPA regulated contaminates, the stormwater is
considered wastewater. A permit from Ohio EPA is required to address these
sites.
      (6)   Solid Waste: Proper permits shall be obtained for development
projects on solid waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Wastewater: Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other
paint wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance
with applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall
occur at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface
or ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site’s hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
         C.   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all
times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the
construction.
         D.   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the Community
Engineer to the meeting.
   (w)   Stormwater Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the stormwater management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 25-year
design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed
so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow
control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of
the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the emergency
spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash rack shall
be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe
conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
stormwater management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 25-year design storm capacity unless exempted in writing
by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool. Only native
plant material shall be used in vegetating the water pool and aquatic bench.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. Only native plant material shall be used in
landscaping the aquatic bench.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community Engineer
to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in stormwater runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased stormwater runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent retention
ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention tanks.

1469.15 STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The owner shall
provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one (1),
two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred (100)
year storms.
 
   (b)   Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty- four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in subsection (a) hereof determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from Table 4:
 
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase In Volume Of Runoff Is:

   (c)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities:
      (1)   For any development regulated by this ordinance, the construction
of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if
the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community
Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm
sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
 
   (d)   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in
a manner that compromises the intent of this ordinance to improve the
management of stormwater runoff as established in this section, practical
alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a
reduction of stormwater runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the
intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to
meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives
shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development
project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Community
Engineer. These fees shall be applied by the Community to stormwater management
practices that reduce existing stormwater runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site stormwater management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing stormwater management practice.
      (5)   Other practices approved by the Community Engineer in keeping with
the intent of this section.

(Ord. 70-2017. Passed 6-13-17.)
 
1469.19 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   In all zoning districts and uses all permanent stormwater, soil erosion,
other wastes control, and water quality practices not specifically waived by
the Community shall be constructed prior to the granting of any building
permit. Upon the request of the owner, the Community may defer the construction
or installation of a permanent stormwater, soil erosion, sediment, or other
wastes control or water quality practice prior to the issuance of any building
permit where, in the Community Engineer’s judgment, such proper construction or
installation is not immediately necessary for the protection of the public
health and safety; and where the prior installation or
construction of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the
owner because in the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because
in the case of concrete, building construction could cause cracking and
excessive wear and tear on new structures. In such event, the Community shall
require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee
that such deferred improvements will be properly constructed or installed
within an agreed specified time, but not to exceed six (6) months after the
filing of such final plat.
   The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices.
   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check
or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion,
sediment, and other wastes controls and water quality practices will be
constructed and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer.
   (a)   The Guarantee: The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash. The
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the ORC Chapter 711.101.
      (1)   Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.
      (2)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a Security
Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
Construction Site Conservation Plan having been approved by the Community
Engineer.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee: The furnishing of a performance guarantee will
be maintained in an amount of not less than 120% of the estimate approved by
the Community Engineer, of installation of the deferred improvements.
   (c)   Maintenance Guarantee: The maintenance guarantee shall be maintained
for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance of the
stormwater, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices in an
amount equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension: The Community Engineer may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
   (e)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Slow Release Devices: Performance and maintenance guarantees will be
maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed in
detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
   (h)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released
by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
(Ord. 70-2016. Passed 6-13-17.)
 
1469.20 APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTION CONSERVATION PLANS (CCP).
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the Post-Construction Water Quality,
Riparian Setback and Wetland Setback Plans that have also been developed for
the site.
 
   (b)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the Community in
accordance with this regulation do not relieve the site owner of responsibility
for obtaining and complying with all other necessary permits and/or approvals
from federal, state, county, and local agencies and departments. If
requirements vary, the most stringent requirement shall be followed. Plans
submitted to the Community Engineer for review and approval, shall be
accompanied by all other required permits and documentation relevant to the
project, including but not limited to the permits required and issued by the US
Army Corps Of Engineers and Ohio EPA.
 
   (c)   The application must include a letter or report from a certified
professional in erosion and sediment control (CPESC), or the local county SWCD,
that states that the Construction Site Conservation Plan, the Riparian and
Wetland Setback Plan and the Post- construction Water Quality Plan have been
reviewed for consistency with Ohio EPA and local regulations.
 
   (d)   Five (5) sets of the plans and necessary data required by this
regulation shall be submitted to the Building and Zoning Administrator with
text material being submitted on 8.5 by 11 inch paper and drawings on no larger
than 24 by 36 inch sized paper. Submittals shall include:
      (1)   At the preliminary plan approval request, the preliminary plans
only need to show all of the following existing and planned features: streams,
water bodies, wetlands, riparian and wetland setback areas, permanent SCMs and
stormwater management detention and retention basins.
      (2)   At the improvement plan approval request, the entire Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan must be submitted.
 
   (e)   The Community Engineer shall review the plans, including the review
report from the certified professional in erosion and sediment control (CPESC),
or the local county SWCD and shall approve or return these with comments and
recommendations for revisions within thirty (30) working days after receipt of
the plan as described above. A plan rejected because of deficiencies shall
receive a report stating specific problems. At the time of receipt of a revised
plan, another thirty (30) day review period shall begin, approval of the plans
required by this Chapter does not constitute approval of the proposed
development as required by the City of Olmsted Falls Zoning Code.
   (f)   Approved plans shall remain valid for two (2) years from the date of
approval. After two (2) years the plan(s) approval automatically expires.
   (g)   No soil disturbing activity shall begin before all necessary local,
county, state and federal permits have been granted to the owner or operator.
   (h)   The Community will make construction inspections until the site
reaches final stabilization as determined by the Community Engineer.

1470.01 COMMUNITY.
   Throughout this regulation the Community shall mean the City of Olmsted
Falls, State of Ohio, and its designated agents and representatives.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.02 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan developed to meet this regulation will
be coordinated and combined with the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same
site. These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to
make a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site.  The
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the
NPDES Storm Water Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.03 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The intent of this regulation is to:
   (a)   Protect the receiving stream’s physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics and to maintain stream functions.
   (b)   Establish consistent, technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Community.
   (c)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the community and building sites and minimize the need to
construct, repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
   (d)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground water recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (e)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
   (f)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate storm water
control due to the loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
   (g)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water control.
      (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.04 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.05 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on his or her property. Compliance with
the provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.06 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.07 SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, property subdivision/
property/parcel splits, industrial projects, commercial projects, building
activities on farms, redevelopment of urban areas and all other land uses not
specifically exempted. This chapter does not apply to:
   (a)   Land disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio Administrative

      (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.08 CONSULTATIONS.
   In implementing these regulations the Community Engineer or other Community
officials may consult with the local county Soil and Water Conservation
District (SWCD), state and federal agencies and other technical experts as
necessary. Any costs associated with such consultations may be assessed to the
applicant or his or her designated representative.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.09 RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams, and other natural watercourses within the Community
contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate
uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair
the ability of riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife,
many of which are on Ohio’s Endangered and/or Threatened Species listings, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the Community economically by minimizing encroachment on
wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions
such as dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce
property damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and environment of the Community, and thereby preserving the
character of the Community, the quality of life of the residents of the
Community, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a wetland and/or riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the Community.
   (c)   Applicability and Compliance.
      (1)   These regulations shall apply to:
         A.   All lands that are within the jurisdiction of the Community and
that border designated watercourses and wetlands as defined in these
regulations.
         B.   These regulations shall apply to property subdivision/ property/
parcel split plan approvals, site plan approvals, and land development plan
approvals requested of the Community.   
         C.   These regulations shall apply to all building permits, which
involve soil disturbing activities.
      (2)   The Community shall issue no approvals or permits without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations.
         (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   Designated watercourses shall include those watercourses meeting any
one of the following criteria:
      (1)   All watercourses draining an area greater than ½ square mile, or
      (2)   All watercourses draining an area less than ½ square mile and
having a defined bed and bank.
      (3)   In determining if watercourses have a defined bed and bank, the
Community may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other
technical experts as necessary.
   (b)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 100 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than 20 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 50 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than one-half square mile and up to and including 20 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 25 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area less than one-half square mile and having a defined bed and bank as
determined above.
   (c)   Riparian Setback Map.
      (1)   The Community shall use the latest edition of the official soil
survey that shows drainage features, on the paper maps in the back of the book,
as the map identifying designated watercourses and their riparian setbacks. The
drainage features identified on the paper maps in the official soil survey and
the information contained therein shall be believed to be accurate.
      (2)   At the time of application of this regulation, if any discrepancy
is found between the Riparian Setback Map and the criteria for designated
watercourses or riparian setbacks as set forth in these regulations, the
criteria shall prevail.
      (3)   In reviewing and interpreting the maps the Community may consult
with a representative of the local county SWCD and other technical experts as
necessary.
   (d)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian and wetland setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular
and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water mark of each
designated watercourse and defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state, except that non-
conforming structures and non-conforming uses existing at the time of passage
of this regulation may be continued in their existing state as determined in
the Nonconforming Structures or Uses in Riparian and Wetland Setbacks section
of these regulations. Riparian setbacks shall be established and marked in the
field prior to any soil disturbing or land clearing activities.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian setback shall be
extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
shall be determined by the project engineer conducting a hydrologic analysis of
the project area in conformance with standard engineering practices and
approved by the Community Engineer.
      (4)   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outer boundary of the
wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be protected to the extent detailed in
these regulations.
      (5)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the
Community using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
   (e)   The applicant or his or her designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian and wetland setbacks, including any
expansions or modifications as required by these regulations, and identifying
these setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel splits, commercial
development or other land development plans, and/or building permit
applications submitted to the Community. This delineation may be done by a
metes and bounds, or higher level, survey and shall be subject to review and
approval by the Community. As a result of this review, the Community may
consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other technical
experts as necessary.
   (f)   Prior to any land clearing or soil disturbing activity, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be clearly delineated on site by the applicant or his or
her designated representative, and such delineation shall be maintained
throughout soil disturbing activities.
   (g)   Approvals or subdivision plan approval, site plan approval, nor land
development plan approval shall be issued by the Community prior to on-site
delineation of riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these
regulations.  No building permits which include land clearing or soil
disturbing activities shall be issued by the Community prior to delineation of
riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these regulations.
   (h)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision/property/parcel
split, land development, or other improvement, riparian and wetland setbacks
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records of the Community.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07; Ord. 33-2019. Passed 9-10-19.)
1470.11 ESTABLISHMENT OF WETLAND SETBACKS.
   Wetland setbacks are established as follows:
   (a)   A minimum of 50 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 3
Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (b)   A minimum of 25 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 2
Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07; Ord. 33-2019. Passed 9-10-19.)
1470.12 PROCEDURE FOR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if

applicant shall submit a letter from the qualified wetland professional with
the preliminary plat or permit application verifying his or her negative
findings.
   (b)   New residential or commercial or other type development and projects
involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for approval of a preliminary plat or
building permit for new residential, commercial or other type of development
that involves changes in any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall retain a qualified
wetland professional to survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If
no wetlands are found, the applicant or his or her designated representative
shall submit a letter with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying
that a qualified wetland professional has surveyed the site and found no
wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following procedures shall be followed.
      (2)   A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the Community
Engineer, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or
current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed development site
using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland
evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation. Acceptance
of this determination shall be subject to approval by the Community Engineer
      (3)   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel split plans,
land development plans, and/or permit applications submitted to the Community.
         A.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
Community, using delineation protocols accepted by the US Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
         B.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and bounds,
or higher level, survey subject to approval by the Community.
      (4)   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the applicant

Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Ohio EPA. (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.15 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS
   (a)   A nonconforming use within a riparian and wetland setback which is in
existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not otherwise
permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the use shall not
be changed or enlarged unless it is changed to a use permitted under these
regulations.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure within a riparian and wetland setback which
is in existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the
existing building footprint or roofline may not be expanded or enlarged in such
a way that would move the structure closer to the stream or wetland.
   (c)   A nonconforming structure or use or deteriorated structure within a
riparian and wetland setback which is in existence at the time of passage of
this regulation, and which is discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a
period of six (6) months or more, may not be revived, restored, or re-
established. This section shall not apply to a residence that is vacant and
which is not subject to condemnation orders by the Building Commissioner. This
section shall also not prohibit ordinary repairs to a residence or residential
accessory building that are not in conflict with other provisions in this
regulation.
   (d)   A nonconforming structure or use that is discontinued may be resumed
any time within six (6) months from such discontinuance but not thereafter.  No
change or resumption shall be permitted that is more detrimental to riparian
and wetland setbacks, as measured against the intent and objectives of these
regulations as determined by the Community, than the existing or former non-
conforming structure or use.
   (e)   In the case of a nonconforming structure within a riparian or wetland
setback, the Community will allow a ten (10) foot maintenance access zone
measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend further into the
setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized and
vegetation is restored to the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon
completion.  If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as part of any
such maintenance activity, a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or
the Ohio EPA, as appropriate, must be submitted prior to the onset of the soil
disturbing activity.
      (f)   In the case of a nonconforming residential structure, the Community
Engineer may allow minor upgrades to the structure that extend further into the
riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious decks/patios, provided the
modifications do not extend more than ten (10) feet further toward the
watercourse than the original foundation of the structure existing at the time
of passage of this regulation, and further provided that the modification will
not impair the function of the riparian zone nor destabilize any slope nor
stream bank, as determined by the Community Engineer. (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-
24-07.)
1470.16 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS
   (a)   The Community may grant a variance from this regulation as provided
herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the Community shall
consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian and/or wetland area
functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the Community shall consider the
following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where gravel or porous
pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and similar products) will do the job.
   (c)   In making a variance determination, the Community may consider the
following:
      (1)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this section is made
unbuildable.
      (2)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the Community’s flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the Community.
      (7)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (8)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.
      (9)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (10)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
      (11)   In the case of a lot made unbuildable by this regulation, consider
the minimum variance needed to make it buildable for an appropriately sized and
compatibly designed structure, while following the guidance provided in this
section.
      (12)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flood or
erosion damage to either the applicant’s property or to other properties.
      (13)   Culverting of watercourses should be avoided.
      (14)   Whether the variance will result in the need for artificial slope
or bank stabilization measures that could interfere with the function of the
riparian zone. (Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)
1470.17 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or his or her designated representative disputes the
boundary of a riparian or wetland setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit
documentation to the Community which describes the boundary, the applicant’s
proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed boundary change.
   (b)   The Community shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a
written determination within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty
(60) days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant. If during this
evaluation the Community requires further information, it may be required of
the applicant. In the event that the Community requests such additional
information, the sixty (60) day limit on the Community’s review shall be
postponed until the applicant provides such information.
   (c)   Any party aggrieved by any wetland or riparian setback determination
under this regulation may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 25-2007. Passed 4-24-07.)

unsanitary or which so utterly fail to provide the amenities essential to
decent living that they are unfit for human habitation, or are likely to cause
sickness or disease, so as to cause injury to the health, morals, safety or
general welfare of those living therein; and
   (e)   Those having light, air and sanitation facilities which are inadequate
to protect the health, morals, safety or general welfare of human beings who

provisions of this Building Code, the Fire Prevention Code or any other

1477.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Olmsted Falls, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Olmsted Falls has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility . for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Olmsted Falls as identified in subsection (f), below, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Olmsted Falls.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and /
or maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective December 3, 2010.
         B.   Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Olmsted Falls as required by Section
1477.04(c), below, Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 26100 Bagley Road
Olmsted Falls, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Olmsted Falls, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 97-
2010. Passed 10-12-10.)
1477.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application. The
definitions provided in these regulations shall apply only to these
regulations.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of I to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of I to 3 feet (usually areas of pond in g); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than I square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined andlor approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 ofthe Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods,
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Olmsted Falls
Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 1, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AI-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include

apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and I or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subj ect to change and I or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1477.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., above.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Olmsted Falls specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1477.03(j)(1)A.3., above, when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Olmsted
Falls.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
   I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Hearings. Hearings shall follow the procedures outlined in Chapter
1232 of the Olmsted Falls Zoning Code. (Ord. 121-2010. Passed 12-28-10.)
1477.06 ENFORCEMENT.

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these

as stated in Section
1477.03(i).

violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) below.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) below.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Olmsted Falls from taking such other lawful action as

shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the
penalties stated herein. (Ord. 97-2010. Passed 10-12-10.)

1479.06 PROTECTION OF TENANTS AND PURCHASERS.
   (a)   Notice to Prospective Tenants. Throughout so much of the 180-day
period immediately before the filing of a declaration with the County Recorder,
during which a developer of a conversion condominium development is the owner
thereof, he or she shall give written notice to each prospective tenant, before
such tenant enters into a lease, that such rental units may be converted to
condominiums within such period.
   (b)   Notice of Conversion and Public Offering Statement. A developer of a
conversion condominium development shall deliver to each of the tenants in
possession written notice of the conversion and the Public Offering Statement
not less than 120 days before requiring the tenant to vacate, provided that in
the case of a tenant who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf, blind or
unable to walk without assistance, the developer shall deliver such notice of
conversion and the Public Offering Statement not less than 180 days before
requiring such tenant to vacate.
   (c)   Appropriate Notices. A developer of a conversion condominium
development shall deliver appropriate notices of conversion based upon his or
her best knowledge and information as to the age or health of each tenant. No
tenant who receives other than a 180-day notice of conversion shall be deemed
to be entitled to a 180-day notice unless within fifteen days of receipt of an
inappropriate notice the tenant delivers a written statement to the developer
declaring that the tenant is over sixty years of age or is deaf, blind or
unable to walk without assistance, and in such case such statement shall be
presumed to be true in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   (d)   Expiration of Tenancy Before End of Notice Period. A tenant whose
tenancy expires other than for cause, before the expiration of 120 days from
the date of the delivery of the notice of conversion, shall have the right to
an additional tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental
until the expiration of such notice thereof to the developer within thirty days
of the date of the delivery of such notice of conversion. In the case of a
tenant who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf, blind or unable to walk
without assistance, such tenant shall have the right to an additional tenancy
on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental until the expiration
of such 180-day period by giving written notice thereof to the developer within
sixty days of the date of the delivery of such notice of conversion.
   (e)   Expiration of Tenancy After Ninety Days from Notice.
      (1)   A tenant whose tenancy expires after ninety days from the date of
the delivery of a notice of conversion shall have the right to terminate his or
her lease upon forty-five days written notice, without penalty or other
termination charge to the tenant. By delivering such notice of termination, the
tenant waives the right of first refusal provided for in subsection (h) hereof.
      (2)   Paragraph (e)(1) hereof shall not apply to tenants who have
received notice under subsection (a) hereof before entering into a lease.
   (f)   Contents of Notice of Conversion.
      (1)   A notice of conversion shall include a copy of this chapter as an
attachment.
      (2)   A notice of conversion shall contain a statement indicating that
such notice shall not be construed as abrogating any right a tenant may have
under a valid existing written lease.
      (3)   A notice of conversion shall contain a statement instructing a
tenant that he or she may advise the Building Department of any structural or
mechanical defect in the building or common areas and of any unhealthful or
unsafe condition therein which the tenant believes should be corrected.
      (4)   The failure of a developer to give notice of conversion as required
in this section shall be a defense to an action for possession.
   (g)   Service of Notice of Conversion and Public Offering Statement.
      (1)   A notice of conversion and a Public Offering Statement shall be
deposited in the United States mail and addressed to a tenant at his or her
last known residence, which may be the address of the property subject to the
lease, sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with
sufficient prepaid postage affixed to carry it to its destination. The tenant's
refusal to accept delivery shall be deemed adequate service. If such mailing is
returned to the developer undelivered to the tenant for any reason other than
the refusal of the tenant to accept delivery, the developer shall forthwith
remail such mailing by regular United States mail, and such remailing shall be
deemed to be delivered on the third day after it is deposited in the mail.
Personal delivery is permissible if service cannot be made by United States
mail.
      (2)   The Public Offering Statement shall be filed with the City on the
same day that the notice of conversion and Public Offering Statement are
deposited in the United States mail to tenants.
   (h)   Tenant's Right of First Refusal.
      (1)   During the ninety days following the delivery of a notice of
conversion and a Public Offering Statement, and during the 120 days following
the delivery of the notice of conversion and the Public Offering Statement in
the case of any person who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf, blind or
unable to walk without assistance, any person who is both a tenant on the date
of the delivery of the notice of conversion and the Public Offering Statement
and also a current tenant shall have the exclusive right of first refusal to
purchase his or her unit.
      (2)   During such period, the developer may offer to sell such unit to
prospective purchasers other than the tenant at a price not less than that
offered to the tenant or on terms not more favorable than those offered to the
tenant, and each contract for the sale of the unit shall conspicuously disclose
the existence of, and shall be subject to, such right of first refusal.
      (3)   If, during such period, the tenant fails to purchase the unit, the
developer shall not offer to sell the unit during the following ninety days at
a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms
offered to the tenant without first making the same offer to the tenant, who
shall have ten days therefrom within which to accept the offer.
   (i)   Co-tenant's Rights.
      (1)   If there is more than one tenant leasing a unit, then each such
tenant shall be entitled to contract for the purchase of a proportionate share
of the unit and of a proportionate share of the share of any tenant who elects
not to purchase.
      (2)   In no case shall this subsection be deemed to authorize the
purchase of less than the entire interest in the unit to be conveyed.
   (j)   Tenant's Right to Cancel Contract.
      (1)   A tenant may, at his or her election, cancel an executed contract
between himself or herself and the developer for the purchase of a condominium
ownership interest by delivering to the developer or his or her agent a written
notice of cancellation at any time before midnight local time of the third day
following the date the contract is signed by the tenant, notwithstanding any
other provision of this chapter.
      (2)   Upon receipt of such timely cancellation, the developer shall
immediately refund any deposit, earnest money or other funds and the tenant
shall have no further rights or liabilities under the contract. Each tenant's
contract for the sale of the unit shall conspicuously disclose the tenant's
right of cancellation.
   (k)   Developer's Right of Access.
      (1)   A tenant in a conversion condominium development shall not
unreasonably withhold consent to the developer to enter his or her unit in
order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, supply
necessary or agreed services or show the unit to a purchaser.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, or unless it is impractical to
do so, the developer shall give the tenant reasonable notice of his or her
intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Twenty-four hours is
presumed to be a reasonable notice, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
      (3)   The developer shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant. Entry by the developer in excess of twice in any seven-day
period for the purpose of showing the unit to purchasers shall be presumed to
be an abuse of the right of access, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   (l)   Nonwaiverabilitv of Obligations and Rights. Neither the obligations
nor the rights set forth in this section may be waived in a contract of lease,
a contract of sale or otherwise, and any attempted waiver is void.
   (m)   Delivery of Public Offering Statement to Purchasers Other Than
Tenants.

to a purchaser other than a tenant not less than fifteen days before the
execution of a contract for the purchase of a unit.
      (2)   On the day of the delivery of the Public Offering Statement, the
developer shall obtain a receipt signed by such purchaser acknowledging that he
or she has received the Public Offering Statement and has also received a copy
of such receipt on such date. Such receipt shall be kept on file in the
possession of the developer for two years from such date, and such receipt
shall be subject to inspection by the City at any reasonable time.
   (n)   Purchaser's Right to Cancel Contract.
      (1)   Unless a purchaser is given the Public Offering Statement not less
than fifteen days before executing a contract for the purchase of a unit, the
purchaser may cancel the contract within fifteen days after first receiving the
Public Offering Statement. The notice of cancellation by the purchaser must be
in writing, and cancellation is to be without penalty. All payments which were
made by the purchaser before cancellation, including interest where applicable,
shall be refunded by the developer within three days after receiving the notice
of cancellation.
      (2)   If the developer fails to provide a purchaser with a Public
Offering Statement and all amendments thereto before conveying a unit, the
purchaser, in addition to any rights to damages or other relief, is entitled to
receive from the developer an amount equal to ten percent of the sales price of
the unit as liquidated damages.
      (3)   This subsection shall apply to tenants, in addition to the tenant's
right to cancel a contract, as provided in subsection (j) hereof.
      (4)   Each purchaser's contract for the sale of the unit shall
conspicuously disclose the purchaser's right of cancellation.
      (5)   The purchaser's right to cancel under this section may not be
waived in the contract of sale or otherwise and any attempted waiver is void.
         (Ord. 79-82. Passed 12-11-79.)
