Drane Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Upper Sandusky,
State of Ohio, a majority of all members elected thereto concurring that:
   SECTION I. The ordinances of the City of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Upper Sandusky

by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

3)   The position of Mayor shall be a full-time position and the Mayor during

purposes of this section "other full-time employment" shall mean either the
Mayor's self-employment or the Mayor's employment by others which employment
consists of compensated time spent by the Mayor in such employment in excess of
fifteen hours per week.   
   (Amended November 8, 2022.)
SECTION 3.03 VACANCY IN OFFICE OF MAYOR.
   1)   Temporary Absence from Office of Mayor   
   When the Mayor is temporarily absent from the office of Mayor due to any of
the following reasons:
      
   a)   Permitted and scheduled vacation time.
   b)   Temporary illness- defined as illnesses, including but not limited to
illness caused by accidents whose recovery duration shall not result in vacancy
from office for a period of time exceeding one month from onset of disabling

the Council.    
   Then in such event the President of Council shall become the Acting Mayor.
   During such period of the Mayor's temporary disability as defined above the
President of the Council as Acting Mayor shall have the same powers and
authority as the Mayor has EXCEPT the power to disapprove legislation of the
Council.
   During any period of time which the President of Council shall be the Acting
Mayor, the President of Council shall retain the office of President of Council
and the rights and duties as are attendant thereto. Further the President of
Council in the dual capacity of President of Council and Acting Mayor shall
remain a Member of Council with all the powers and duties of a Council Member.
2)   Permanent Absence from Office of Mayor

   c)   The Mayor's removal from Office for any reason   
   d)   The occurrence of event(s) disqualifying the Mayor from serving as

   In any case of the Mayor's death, resignation, removal or disqualification
as recited above, the President of Council shall remain the Acting Mayor until
the Acting Mayor shall determine to accept the position of Mayor or shall elect
to decline to accept the position of Mayor as next provided.
   Upon the occurrence of an event qualifying as a Mayor's permanent absence
from office, a period of time from the permanent absence event until the next
regularly scheduled Council Meeting shall commence. In no event shall such
period of time be less than twenty days from the occurrence of the permanent
absence event until the next regularly scheduled Council meeting. For
definition herein the twentieth day may include the date of the next regularly
scheduled Council Meeting. If such period of time is less than twenty days then
such period of time shall continue until the next regularly scheduled Council
meeting which meeting date is scheduled more than twenty days after the
occurrence of the permanent absence event. During such period of time the
Acting Mayor shall provide the services of Mayor as provided for and as defined
above.
    If the Acting Mayor accepts the position of Mayor or shall not decline to
serve as Mayor prior to the end of the defined term as recited above, then upon
the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs first, the Acting Mayor shall
become Mayor and thereafter serve the remaining term of the Mayor who has died,
resigned, been removed from Office or has been disqualified to serve as Mayor.
   Upon the Acting Mayor becoming Mayor, the new Mayor shall forfeit the
position of President of Council and shall cease to be a Member of Council.
Said vacant Council Member seat shall thereafter be filled as provided in
Section
4.12 which succeeds.
   In the event that the Acting Mayor/President of Council timely declines to
serve as Mayor then in that event, said Acting Mayor/President of Council shall
forfeit the seats of Acting Mayor and President of Council but shall retain the
seat of Council Member and serve the remaining term for which said Member of
Council was elected.
   Upon the occurrence of such declination to serve as Mayor by the Acting
Mayor, the President Pro-Tem of the Council shall immediately succeed to the
office of President of the Council. In such event the President of Council
shall serve as Acting Mayor as provided for above and the time frames for
acceptance of the Office of Mayor shall commence and run as provided for above.
   At the next regularly scheduled Council meeting, the Council shall elect a
successor President Pro-Tem of the Council who shall commence service for the
unexpired term for which the predecessor President Pro-Tem was elected.
   In the event that the office of Mayor has not been filled within six months
after the permanent absence of the prior Mayor and if the remaining term of the
prior Mayor is less than two years the Council by majority vote may extend the
term of the acting Mayor to continue to serve as acting Mayor until the next
regularly scheduled election.
   In the event that the office of Mayor has not been filled within six months
after the permanent absence of the prior Mayor and if the remaining unexpired
term of the prior Mayor is in excess of two years, the Council by majority vote
may elect to have a special election to fill the remaining unexpired term of
the prior Mayor. (Amended November 8, 2022.)
SECTION 3.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE MAYOR.

officer of the Municipality. The Mayor shall be responsible for the
administration of all municipal affairs of all departments and divisions of the

this Charter, the ordinances of the Municipality and State laws. In addition to
the foregoing, the Mayor shall have the following powers:
   (1)   The Mayor shall attend all Council meetings and shall have the right
to take part in discussions but may not vote.
   (2)    The Mayor shall see that all laws, provisions of this Charter and

subject to the Mayor's direction and supervision, are faithfully executed.
   (3)    The Mayor shall prepare and submit the annual budget and capital

   (8)   The Mayor shall be the contracting officer of the Municipality and
shall award and execute all contracts and agreements on behalf of the
Municipality in the manner and under the procedures as are and may be

other body, board or commission exercising administrative duties under this
Charter, to act as purchasing agent and the Mayor may authorize said officer,
employee, committee, body, board or commission to award and execute said
contracts and orders on behalf of the Municipality. The Mayor or any other
officer, employee, committee, body, board or commission acting as a purchasing
agent shall not willfully cause or allow any contract or order to be split or
divided into separate orders or contracts in order to avoid the requirements of
this subsection or the requirements of competitive bidding as required by the

      (Approved by voters November 2, 1976.)
   (9)    The Mayor and the Clerk of Council shall execute on behalf of the

or instrument.
   (11)   The Mayor shall perform such other duties as are conferred or
required by this Charter, by any ordinance or resolution of the Council, or by
the laws of the State of Ohio.
      (Amended November 8, 2022.)
SECTION 3.05 VETO POWER.
   Each resolution or ordinance adopted by Council shall be attested by the

ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

CHAPTER 105
Open Records Policy
105.01   Public records.
105.02   Records requests.
105.03   Costs for public records.
105.04   E-mail.
105.05   Failure to respond to public record request.
105.01 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The City of Upper Sandusky, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: Any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the City. All records of the City are public unless they
are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City that, as required by Ohio law, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (See Section
105.04 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently. (Ord. 178-11. Passed 2-4-08.)
105.02  RECORDS REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requestor must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requestor for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requestor does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is the City of Upper Sandusky’s general policy that
this information is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (in both draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than
twenty (20) pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily
available in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily,
these should be made as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing by the City within three (3) business days following
the office’s receipt of the request. If a request is deemed significantly
beyond “routine”, such as seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring
extensive research, the acknowledgment must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority. (Ord. 178-11. Passed 2-4-08.)
105.03 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($.05) per page.
Prepayment is required.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc. Prepayment is required.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (b)   Requestors may ask that documents be mailed to them. Prepayment is
required for actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
(Ord. 178-11. Passed 2-4-08.)
105.04  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the City are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
105.01 Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/
or to the City of Upper Sandusky’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the City, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining them per
established schedules and making them available for inspection and copying in
accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (Ord. 178-11. Passed 2-4-08.)
105.05 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC RECORD REQUEST.
   The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, City of Upper Sandusky’s failure
to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with
the law and to pay the requestor attorney’s fees and damages.

(Ord. 134-6. Passed 9-8-75.)
121.02 IDENTITY THEFT POLICY.
   (a)   Background. The risk to the Municipality, its employees and customers
from data loss and identity theft is of significant concern to the Municipality
and can be reduced only through the combined efforts of every employee and
contractor.
   (b)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to help
protect employees, customers, contractors and the Municipality from damages
related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information.
      (2)   This policy will:
         A.   Define sensitive information;
         B.   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on
paper;
         C.   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
         D.   Place the Municipality in compliance with State and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
      (3)   This policy enables the Municipality to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the
Municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
Municipality:
         A.   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity
within new or existing covered accounts;
         B.   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
         C.   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
         D.   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
   (c)   Scope. This policy and protection program applies to employees,
contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the
Municipality, including all personnel affiliated with third parties.
   (d)   Policy.  
      (1)   Sensitive information policy.
         A.   Definition of sensitive information. Sensitive information
includes the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:
            1.   Credit card information, including any of the following:
               a.   Credit care number (in part or whole).
               b.   Credit card expiration date.
               c.   Cardholder name.
               d.   Cardholder address.
            2.   Tax identification numbers, including:
               a.   Social security number.
               b.   Business identification number.
               c.   Employer identification numbers.
            3.   Payroll information, including, among other information:
               a.   Paychecks.
               b.   Pay stubs.
            4.   Cafeteria plan check request and associated paperwork.
            5.   Medical information for any employee or customer, including
but not limited to:
               a.   Doctors names and claims.
               b.   Insurance claims.
               c.   Prescriptions.
               d.   Any related personal medical information.
            6.   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee
or contractor, examples of which include:
               a.   Date of birth.
               b.   Address.
               c.   Phone numbers.
               d.   Maiden name.
               e.   Names.
               f.   Customer number.
            7.   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense
judgment in securing confidential information to the proper extent.
Furthermore, this section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public
Records Act and the Municipality’s open records policy. If an employee is
uncertain of the sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he/she
should contact their supervisor. In the event that the Municipality cannot
resolve a conflict between this policy and the Ohio Records Act, the
Municipality will consult with legal counsel.
         B.   Hard Copy Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing
work for the Municipality will comply with the following policies:
            1.   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
            2.   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information
and record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
            3.   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers, fax machines and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
            4.   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
            5.   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded
they will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical shredding device. Locked shred bins are labeled “Confidential paper
shredding and recycling.” Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in
accordance with the City’s records retention policy.
         C.   Electronic Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing
work for the Municipality will comply with the following policies:
            1.   Internally sensitive information may be transmitted using
approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when
stored in an electronic format.
            2.   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted
and password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a
statement such as this should be included in the e-mail:
   “This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is
intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by
others is strictly prohibited.”
   (e)   Responding to Red Flags. 
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must
act quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
Municipality from damages and loss.
         A.   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
         B.   The designated authority will complete additional authentication
to determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
      (2)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate
actions must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
         A.   Cancelling the transaction;
         B.   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
         C.   Determining the extent of liability of the Municipality; and
         D.   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
   (f)   Periodic Updates to Plan.
      (1)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required,
the program will be reevaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
      (2)   Periodic reviews will include as assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
      (3)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
      (4)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Municipality and its
customers.
   (g)   Program Administration.
      (1)   Involvement of management.
         A.   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
         B.   The Identity Theft Prevention Program is the responsibility of
the governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately
documented and maintained.
         C.   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Mayor’s Administrative Assistant.
      (2)   Staff training.
         A.   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials
and contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the Municipality or its customers.
         B.   The Mayor’s Administrative Assistant is responsible for ensuring
identity theft training for all requisite employees and contractors.
         C.   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to
receive additional training as changes to the program are made.
      (3)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.
         A.   It is the responsibility of the Municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
         B.   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft
prevention program, consistent with the guidance of the red flags rules and
validated by appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these
requirements.
         C.   Any specific requirements of service providers should be
specifically addressed in the appropriate contract arrangements.

rank, the Civil Service Commission shall, within sixty days of such vacancy,

held and an eligible list established, the Commission shall forthwith certify
to the Department of Safety or other appointing officer as provided for in
Section
8.05 of the Charter of the City, the three persons having the highest rating;
or if there are only two persons having taken the promotional examination then

151.04 HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE.
   (a)   The City of Upper Sandusky is committed to providing a work
environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. The City of
Upper Sandusky prohibits all forms of unlawful harassment, including sexual
harassment. Unlawful harassment may exist in many forms. Generally, unlawful
harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual,
that is based on an individual’s protected status, such as sex, color, race,
religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or other legally
protected status. The City of Upper Sandusky will not tolerate unlawful
harassing conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that unreasonably
interferes with an individual’s work performance, or that creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
   (b)   Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex
when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of the individual’s employment; or
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is used
for the basis of an employment decision that affects that individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual’s work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   Sexual harassment may include a range of behaviors and may involve
individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances,
these behaviors may include, but are not limited to, explicit sexual
propositions, sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, sexually-oriented joking,
obscene language or gestures, display of obscene printed or visual material,
and physical contact, such as unwelcome touching, brushing against someone’s
body, or assault.
   (c)   No employee of the City of Upper Sandusky has the authority to require
any other employee or individual to engage in any form of sexual behavior as a
term or condition of employment.
   (d)   Any other form of unlawful harassment, including, but not limited to,
harassment based upon color, race, religion, national origin, age, disability,
veteran status or other legally protected status, is also unlawful and strictly
prohibited. Depending on the circumstances, this type of unlawful harassment
may include a range of behaviors such as, but not limited to, verbal epithets,
insults, assault, the display of insensitive or otherwise offensive printed or
visual material, and insensitive or offensive jokes or gestures.
   (e)   Any employee who believes that he or she is the victim of
discrimination or unlawful harassment has a responsibility to immediately
report such issue to his or her supervisor, or, if the supervisor is
unavailable or if the employee believes that it would be inappropriate to
contact the supervisor, the employee should immediately contact the Mayor or
Law Director. All employees are responsible for helping to ensure that the City
of Upper Sandusky does not allow discrimination or unlawful harassment to take
place. Any employee who feels that they have witnessed such conduct has
responsibility to immediately report such conduct to his or her supervisor,
Mayor or Law Director as the case may be.
   (f)   All reports of discrimination or unlawful harassment will be
investigated promptly and such investigation will be conducted by an
appropriate individual in order to ensure a thorough and impartial
investigation. All reports will be handled as confidentially as possible. It is
important to note that the City of Upper Sandusky cannot conduct a thorough and
impartial investigation and ensure complete confidentiality. Following the
conclusion of the investigation, the victim of the alleged discrimination or
harassment will be advised of the findings of the investigation and any
conclusion or action taken following the report. Any person who has been
alleged to have engaged in discrimination or unlawful harassment will be
notified of the allegations and informed of the investigation. The person who
has alleged to have engaged in unlawful harassment will be given an opportunity
to make a written statement regarding the report. Following the conclusion of
the investigation, any employee who is found to have engaged in discrimination
or unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment. In all instances, the City of Upper
Sandusky will take corrective action that is designed to stop the harassing
conduct and to prevent such conduct from recurring in the future. If necessary,
other action will be taken to remedy the discrimination or unlawful harassment.
   (g)   The City of Upper Sandusky prohibits any type of retaliation against
any individual who has made a good faith report of discrimination or unlawful
harassment or who has participated in an investigation of discrimination or
unlawful harassment. Any act of retaliation against any employee for making a
good faith report or participating in an investigation is a violation of this
policy and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination
of employment. Any employee who believes that they are the victim of
retaliation should report such retaliation to his or her supervisor or to the
Mayor or Law Director as the case may be.
   (h)   The City of Upper Sandusky needs employees’ help in preventing
discrimination and unlawful harassment. It is important that all employees
recognize this shared responsibility and are willing to be forthcoming
regarding any such issues. If an employee does not report such issues, it may
be difficult for the City to discover that such discrimination or unlawful
harassment is occurring. The City of Upper Sandusky cannot correct conduct of
which it is not aware. By working together, the City and its employees can help
eliminate discrimination and unlawful harassment in the workplace.

compensation earned by him, and/or gross income from such business less
allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned
during the preceding year and subject to the tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
(Ord. 234-5. Approved by voters 3-25-69.)
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the
Commissioner of Taxation may require, including a statement that the figures
used in the return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set
forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or
other period.
   (c)   The Commissioner of Taxation may extend the time for filing of the
annual return upon the request of the taxpayer. If the request is granted, the
extended due date of the municipal income tax return for any taxpayer that has
requested an extension for filing a federal income tax return shall be the last
day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
return has been extended. Any taxpayer not required to file a federal tax
return may be granted an extension for a period not to exceed six months.
(Ord. 45-11. Passed 9-20-04.)
   (d)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by this
chapter on such earnings and profits. The taxpayer making such return shall, at
the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount
of taxes shown as due thereon; provided, however, that where any portion of the
tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of
Section
181.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
181.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return.
   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
      (1)   The claiming of credit on a return or declaration for amounts paid
to any other municipality under the provisions of Section
181.07 shall constitute an assignment and transfer to the Municipality of all
right, title and interest of the taxpayer claiming such credit in and to any
claim for refund of such amounts so paid to such other municipality. In the
event a refund is not received by the Municipality in an amount equal to the
credit claimed by reason of tax payments made to another municipality and
subject to reciprocity, then the taxpayer shall be liable to the Municipality
for and as taxes due from the date of the filing of such return upon which such
credit was claimed of the amount by which the claimed credit exceeds the amount
of refund received by the Municipality.
      (2)   Assignment of any claim for refund to which a resident may be
entitled from any municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of that
portion of Municipal income tax represented by such assignment. Provided,
however, if satisfactory evidence is offered that the taxpayer is entitled to
the claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of
credit therefor because of fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
   (e)   The Commissioner of Taxation is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation, subject to the approval of the Board of Review, that the return of
an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer or
employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an
employee, and paid by him or them to the Commissioner of Taxation shall be
accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income subject to
the tax or taxes under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or
other compensation.
   (f)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the
Municipality constituting a portion only of its total business, the
Commissioner of Taxation shall require such additional information as may be
necessary to ascertain whether net profits allocable to the Municipality are
being distorted by the shifting of income, apportionment of expenses or other
devices available to a common control. If the Commissioner finds that a
person’s net profits allocable to the Municipality are distorted by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and proper allocation of
net profits to the Municipality. If necessary, the Commissioner may require the
filing of a consolidated return.
   (g)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar
($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
(Ord. 234-5. Approved by voters 3-25-69.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Municipality who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis shall deduct at the time of the payment of such salary, wage, commission
or other compensation, the tax of one percent of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee and
shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each
calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the
amount of taxes so deducted. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed
by or acceptable to the Commissioner and shall be subject to the rules and
regulations prescribed therefor by him.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality as a trustee for the
benefit of the Municipality and any such tax collected by such employer from
his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality be deemed a
trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages
or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person’s residence.
(Ord. 234-5. Approved by voters 3-25-69.)

prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied.
(Ord. 137-9. Passed 9-6-94.)
185.02 PURPOSE.
   There shall be levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three percent (3%) of the
amount paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the lodging for the
purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City, and
to help finance the construction and equipping of a Convention Center.
(Ord. 137-9. Passed 9-6-94.)
185.03 DEFINITIONS.

dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use

185.04 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax shall be known as the transient guest tax. It applies and is

the time the tax is to be collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
and in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (d)   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions
of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.

the written request of the Tax Commissioner the means, facilities, and
opportunity for making the examinations and investigations authorized herein.
   (b)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to order any person to
appear in his office and to examine such person, under oath, concerning any
transaction or receipts from any transaction which was or should have been
returned for taxation under this Chapter. For such purposes, the Tax

attendance of any person before him, whether as a party or a witness, whenever
the Tax Commissioner believes that such person has knowledge of such
transactions or receipts of such transactions pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or
to file a return or to make a remittance of said tax or any portion thereof, as
required by this Chapter, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed in such manner as
he may deem best to obtain information on which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this Chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused

assess against such vendor the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this
Chapter.

days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing
to the Tax Commissioner for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by
the vendor is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, penalty and
interest determined by the Tax Commissioner shall become final and conclusive
and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax
Commissioner shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the
manner previously prescribed in this section to the vendor to show cause at a
time and place fixed in said notice why said amounts specified therein should
not be fixed for such tax and penalty and interest. At any such hearing, the
vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty and
interest should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Commissioner shall
determine the proper tax, penalty and interest to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the vendor, in the manner prescribed in this
section, of such determination and the amount of such tax, penalty and
interest. The amount determined to be due shall be payable within fifteen (15)

187.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an additional excise tax of three
percent (3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be
furnished to transient guests, as authorized and permitted by Ohio R.C. Chapter
5739 and Section 5739.08(B). Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to
effectuate that purpose and to be consistent with any requirement of law,
compliance with which is a prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to
be levied.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.02 PURPOSE.
   There shall be levied an additional excise tax on transactions by which
lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three
percent (3%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the
lodging for the purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs
of the City, and make contributions to visitors and convention bureaus
operating within Wyandot County, Ohio.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this title the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. The singular
shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include the feminine and the
neuter.
   (a)    "Board of Review" means the Board of Review created by and
constituted as provided in Section
181.13.

   (c)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,

other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (d)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all

sleeping purposes.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in

employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed a vendor for the purposes of
this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the
managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
      (Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.04 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax shall be known as the additional transient guest tax. It
applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of
the time when the rent is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to
the State or any of its political subdivisions.
   (b)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary
is established.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.05 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each vendor
furnishing lodging to a transient guest shall register such hotel with the Tax
Commissioner. Such registration shall be upon a form prescribed by and
available from the Tax Commissioner and must be completed with any information,
which the Tax Commissioner shall reasonably require.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)

in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. If for any reason
the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the Tax Commissioner may require that
the tax be paid directly to the Tax Commissioner.
   (c)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the transaction is not legally subject
to the tax. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at
the time the tax is to be collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
and in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (d)   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions
of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by a vendor, which has not been paid to the City, shall
be deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City of Upper Sandusky for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.07 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each vendor shall on or before the 20th day of the month make and file
a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Tax Commissioner,
showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the
vendor to the City for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Tax Commissioner deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing
the same to the Tax Commissioner of the City of Upper Sandusky, together with
payment of the full amount of tax shown to be due thereon. Upon cessation of
business for any reason, returns and payments shall be due immediately.
   (b)   All claims for exemption from the tax filed by transient guests with
the vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the report.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may establish shorter reporting periods for any
vendor if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and
he may require further information in the return as such information is
pertinent to the collection of the tax.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Tax Commissioner upon
the basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (e)   The returns shall be signed by the vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.08 RECORDS; INSPECTION, DESTRUCTION.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the charge for the lodging and shown separately on any record thereof, at the
time when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon
every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such
occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor, and the tax shall be paid by the
transient guest to the vendor as trustee for and on account of the City, and
the vendor shall be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
 
   (b)   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
 
   (c)   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging
furnished, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be
the amount due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, bills, and
other pertinent documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the
tax, the vendor's records shall contain a copy of the certificate of exemption
required by Section
187.06. Such records and other documents shall be open during business hours to
the inspection of the Tax Commissioner, and shall be preserved for a period of
three years.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.09 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded provided a claim in
writing therefor stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon
which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Commissioner within three
years of the date of payment.
   (b)   A vendor may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected
and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established that the person from
whom the tax has been collected was not a transient guest; provided, however,
that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the
tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to
charges subsequently payable by the transient guest to the vendor.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing a claim in the manner previously prescribed, but only when the transient
guest having paid the tax to the vendor, establishes to the satisfaction of the
Tax Commissioner that the transient guest has been unable to obtain a refund
from the vendor who collected the tax.
   (d)   When the total refund claimed is one dollar ($1.00) or less, such
amount shall not be refunded.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.10 DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, to keep an accurate
record thereof for a minimum of three years showing dates and amounts of
payments, and to report all moneys so received daily to the Municipal Auditor.
   (b)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter and to enforce the rules and regulations adopted by
the Board of Review.
(Ord. 106-11. Passed 12-19-05.)
187.11 INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers
and records of any vendor subject to the tax levied by this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was made,
of ascertaining the tax due under this chapter. Each vendor shall furnish, upon
the written request of the Tax Commissioner, the means, facilities, and
opportunity for making the examinations and investigations authorized herein.
   (b)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to order any person to
appear in his office and to examine such person, under oath, concerning any
transaction or receipts from any transaction, which was or should have been
returned for taxation under this chapter. For such purposes, the Tax
Commissioner may compel the production of books, papers, records, and the
attendance of any person before him, whether as a party or a witness, whenever
the Tax Commissioner believes that such person has knowledge of such
transactions or receipts of such transactions pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or
to file a return or to make a remittance of said tax or any portion thereof, as
required by this chapter, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed in such manner as
he may deem best to obtain information on which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused
to collect the same or to file a return and to make a remittance of the proper
amount thereof. The Tax Commissioner shall proceed to determine and assess
against the vendor the tax, penalty, and interest provided for in this chapter.
   (d)   As soon as the Tax Commissioner procures such facts and information as
he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by
this chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against such vendor the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this
chapter.
   (e)   In any case wherein such determination is made, the Tax Commissioner
shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by
registered or certified mail upon such vendor. The vendor may within ten (10)
days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing
to the Tax Commissioner for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by
the vendor is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, penalty and
interest determined by the Tax Commissioner shall become final and conclusive
and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax
Commissioner shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the
manner previously prescribed in this section to the vendor to show cause at a
time and place fixed in said notice why said amounts specified therein should
not be fixed for such tax and penalty and interest. At any such hearing, the
vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty and
interest should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Commissioner shall
determine the proper tax, penalty and interest to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the vendor, in the manner prescribed in this
section, of such determination and the amount of such tax, penalty and
interest. The amount determined to be due shall be payable within fifteen (15)
days.

punishable by a maximum fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment
for not more than six (6) months, or both. Each disclosure shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalty, any employee of this

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
191.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month.
(Ord. 242-12. Passed 12-19-16.)
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
191.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
191.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee

used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
191.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

      (1)   “Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.

5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
       (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

191.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
191.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
            (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
            (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division G of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be situated to a municipal corporation as follows:
           (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

municipal corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal
corporation.
                  (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal
corporation from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the
taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or
promotion of sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion.
            (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be situated
to the municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in
the municipal corporation.
           (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the
sale of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be situated to
the municipal corporation.
            (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
situated to the municipal corporation.
            (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be situated to the municipal corporation based upon the
extent to which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal
corporation.
      (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal

municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
      A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit situated under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (F)    (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be situated to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the

commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
            (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation
that imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit
from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
191.081 of this Chapter.
     (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
191.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net
      profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.

            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to

            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be situated to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be situated to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be situated to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
191.04 of this Chapter.

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax. (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the selection allowed under
191.80 of this Ordinance (718.80 of the Ohio Revised Code), a valid election
made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is binding
upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under
191.80 of this Ordinance (718.80 of the Ohio Revised Code) is terminated, a
valid election made under section 191.86 of this Ordinance (718.86 of the Ohio
Revised Code) is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
         (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
191.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
191.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax

         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the

         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

            (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
191.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section

      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 191.081 of this
Chapter.

191.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
191.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
 
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
 
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
191.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
191.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
191.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
191.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
191.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
191.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
 
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
 
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
 
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
 
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. The
extended due date of the municipal tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day
of the taxable year to which the return relates.
 
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
 
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
 
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
 
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
 
   (F)    If the taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of the municipal
income tax return under Division (A), (B) (C) or (E) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first. (Ord. 206-13. Passed 10-2-23.)
191.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
191.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
Section 191.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is
filed beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as
set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in section
191.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section 191.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
section
191.10 of this Chapter.

the Municipality may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars for
each failure to timely file each return, regardless of the liability shown
thereon, except that the Municipality shall abate or refund the penalty

191.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
191.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
 
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
 
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
 
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
 
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions

records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

      (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
 
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
 
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
 
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
191.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
191.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
191.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
 
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.15 FRAUD
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
191.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   The Clerk of Council shall serve as Secretary of The Board of
Review
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
191.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
191.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 211-12. Passed 9-21-15.)
191.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator adopt rules

191.81 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code,
in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in
this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
191.01 of this Chapter, the definition in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in sections
191.80 through
191.95 of the Revised Code.
    As used in sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
191.82 of this Chapter, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating
loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section
191.01 of this Chapter, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
191.86 of this Chapter.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
191.86 of this Chapter.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (L)(2) of section
191.01 of this Chapter, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made
the election described in division (D)(5) of section
191.01 of this Chapter, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction. Nothing in division (B) of
this section shall be construed as allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any
amount more than once or shall be construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct
any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
191.01 of this Chapter, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons
or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised
Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy
when required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax
commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
191.90 of this Chapter. (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.82 NET PROFIT: INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX: ALTERNATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
section
191.80 of this Chapter.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section
191.011 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
191.90 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
191.90 of this Chapter.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section
191.01 of this Chapter by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under sections
191.85 and
191.88 of this Chapter, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any
audit adjustments made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calendar
month preceding the month in which the certification is made. Not later than
the fifth day of each month, the director shall provide for payment of the
amount certified to each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax
fund, plus a pro rata share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund
since the previous payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's
share of such earnings shall equal the proportion that the municipal
corporation's certified tax payment is of the total taxes certified to all
municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment earnings on money in the
municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that fund.
   (B)    If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter after accounting for amounts remitted with the annual
return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall proceed according to
divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 24-13.

order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the OhioRevised Code.

a format prescribed by the commissioner, the name and mailing address of up to
two persons to whom the municipal corporation requests that the commissioner
send the information described in divisions (B) and (C) of this section. The
commissioner shall not provide such information to any person other than a
person who is designated to receive the information under this section and who

191.01 of this Chapter, that administers the municipal corporation's income
tax, except as may otherwise be provided by law.
   (E)   (1)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the

corporation discovers that it has additional information in its possession that
could result in a change to a taxpayer's tax liability, the municipal
corporation may refer the taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an audit. Such
referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall
include any information that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a referral under division (F)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the
referral and any other relevant information available to the commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in division (F) of this section shall be construed as
forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
      (4)    Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a municipal corporation
from filing a writ of mandamus if the municipal corporation believes that the
commissioner has violated the commissioner's fiduciary duty as the
administrator of the tax levied by the municipal corporation.
         (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio Business Gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
191.04 of this Chapter, the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns
and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including
taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. (Ord. 24-

as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means. (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.86 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section
191.04 of this Chapter in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 191.80 of
this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or
(2) of section
191.06 of this Chapter is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
191.80 of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
191.81 of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income"
for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
191.81 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
191.82 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making he computations required in section
191.82 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
191.82 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
191.82 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
191.80 to
191.95 or Chapter 5703. of the Ohio Revised Code to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group. (Ord. 24-
13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.87 INTEREST.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
191.80 of this Chapter fails to pay any tax as required under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date prescribed
for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued
under section
191.90 of this Chapter, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.88 DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section
191.85 of this Chapter.
   
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for
the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause
as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment
shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with section
191.83 of this Chapter.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.89 PENALTY.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter, or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
191.80 of this Chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per
cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on
the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
191.91 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under section
191.90 of this Chapter without regard to any time limitation for the assessment
imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
191.83 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.90 ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section 191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession. The
tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer more
than three years after the later of the date the return subject to assessment
was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time limit may
be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in writing to the
extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time limit in section
191.91 of this Chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner
shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a
hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county. Immediately upon the
filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer
assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by the
clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for municipal income
taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments. Execution shall
issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax commissioner, and all laws
applicable to sales on execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment.
If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the day
the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax due
shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the
Ohio Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes
first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney
general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the
taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division
(B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the
assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the
commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition. If
upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
191.91 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section. (Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.91 REFUNDS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (A) of section
191.90 of the Revised Code. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Ohio Revised Code. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section
191.83 of this Chapter.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous

(Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.92 AMENDED RETURN.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
191.80 of this Chapter and used to determine the tax due under sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter Code must be altered as the result of an adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or
the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
191.90 of this Chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
191.91 of this Chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
191.91 of this Chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)
191.93 RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
191.80 to
191.95 of this Chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a
municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 24-13. Passed 11-20-17.)

tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section
191.15 or 191.151 of this Chapter, or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval
fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio
R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the
towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice required under
Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either
of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is    to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

355.03 PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)    The City of Upper Sandusky Parking Violations Bureau is hereby
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.04. The Parking Violations Bureau shall
be located within the Upper Sandusky Police Department. The Parking Violations
Bureau has jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the
territory of the City of Upper Sandusky. Notwithstanding any other provision of
law to the contrary, each parking infraction that occurs within the
jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of each such
parking infraction shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by the
provisions of this chapter.
   (b)    The operating costs of the Parking Viollations Bureau shall be paid
by the City of Upper Sandusky. The Service Committee shall appoint the
Violations Clerk, necessary clerical employees and hearing examiners. No person
shall be employed as a hearing examiner unless such person is an attorney
admitted to the practice oflaw in the State of Ohio.
   (c)    The fines, penalties, fees, and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained, and disbursed by the Violations Clerk
if the parking infraction out of which the fine, penalties, fees, and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau. The
Violations Clerk shall provide tickets for parking infractions to law

Police and shall also provide tickets for parking infractions upon requisition

   (d)   The Mayor of the City of Upper Sandusky shall have authority to
contract with any nongovernmental entity to provide services in processing,
collecting, and enforcing parking tickets issued by law enforcement officers
and civil judgments and default civil judgments entered pursuant to this
chapter. No contract shall affect the responsibilities of hearing examiners as
prescribed in this chapter, or the ultimate responsibility of the Violations
Clerk to collect, retain, and disburse fines, penalties, fees, and costs for
parking infractions and monies paid in satisfaction of judgments and default
judgments entered pursuant to this chapter.
   All contracts entered into by the Mayor pursuant to this Section shall be
authorized by City Council. (Ord. 161-12. Passed 4-21-14.)
355.04  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE AND LIABILITY.
   (a)    The parking ticket adopted in Section
 355.10 hereof shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which
a person is charged with committing a parking infraction within the City of
Upper Sandusky. The parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for
purposes of this chapter.
   (b)    A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction
charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator
in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Constructive service
of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by affixation as provided in
this subsection, or by the procedure described in subsection (d) hereof, has
the same force and effect, and potentially subjects both the owner and the
operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and costs for
failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the
parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)    The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this Section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City of Upper Sandusky and of the law enforcement agency whose
officer issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)    An operator of a vehicle, who is not the owner of the vehicle, but
who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the
agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this Section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this Section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle, whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction, shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
355.09.
   (e)    Except as provided in Section
 355.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is
served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle, whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued,
and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different,
are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle, who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter, may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle,
whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction.
(Ord. 161-12. Passed 4-21-14.)
355.05 ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)    A person, who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, may answer the charge
by appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail. An
answer shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of the infraction and
shall be in one of the following forms:
      (1)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction,
with an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)    A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the
presence at the hearing of the law enforcement officer, who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction,
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
   If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates
the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall reduce or eliminate the amount of the fine arising out
of the parking infraction. If the fine is reduced or eliminated and the person
has previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the revised fine
shall be returned to the person; if the fine is reduced or eliminated and the
person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay only the amount
of the revised fine. If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the
explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the parking
infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine arising out of the
parking infraction, and if the person has not previously paid the fine, the
person shall pay the entire amount of the fine. If a person admits that he
committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person fails to pay the
amount of the fine due within fourteen (14) days after the Parking Violations
Bureau's determination is mailed to the person by first class mail with a
certificate of mailing, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the
Parking Violations Bureau's determination and the amount of the fine due shall
be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a judgment rendered
subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b) of Section
355.07 hereof.
      (3)    A person, who denies that he committed a parking infraction, shall
be granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
355.07 hereof.
   (c)    If a person, who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, fails to timely
answer the charge, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, the Parking Violations
Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant to Section
355.06 hereof, and proceed according to that Section. Failure to answer the
charge within the ten (10) day period provided by subsection (a) hereof, shall
result in the imposition of an additional penalty often dollars ($10.00).
   (d)    The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, a notification of infraction also shall be sent
to the owner at his most recent address appearing in such records;
      (2)    If the person, who fails to answer, was the owner of the vehicle
and was constructively served with the parking ticket; a notification of
infraction shall be sent to the owner at his most recent address appearing in

      (2)    An identification of the amount of the fine, penalties, and fees

   (c)    A person, who receives a notification of infraction pursuant to this
Section, may answer the parking infraction with which he is charged that is

provisions of Section
355.05(b) hereof for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a

355.07  HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)    (1)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives
a notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Notice of the
hearing shall be mailed to the person by first class mail. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each

      (2)   At the hearing, the City of Upper Sandusky has the burden of
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the
hearing is being conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in
his answer, denied that he committed the parking infraction and requested the
presence at the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking
ticket, the officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the hearing
examiner determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the
officer's presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable
to attend the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing
examiner may grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is
being conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing.
The person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary

Upper Sandusky shall submit the original parking ticket that was personally or
constructively served on the person or a true copy of that ticket, and
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the

parking infraction. The City of Upper Sandusky may present additional evidence
and testimony at the hearing. The City of Upper Sandusky does not have to be
represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   (1)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) hereof appears at the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in
accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall consider all
evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the City of Upper
Sandusky has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person
committed the parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines that the
person committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a
judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate
fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If a person for whom a hearing is to he conducted under subsection
(a) hereof fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit
evidence in accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A default
judgment entered under this subsection shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)    If a person, who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
 355.06 hereof, does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of that
Section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, ifhe
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)    If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsection (b)
(1), (2), or (3) hereof committed the parking infraction, the hearing examiner
shall enter judgment against the City of Upper Sandusky, shall dismiss the
charge of the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)    A default judgment entered under this Section may be vacated by
the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
         B.    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose; and
         C.    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
      (6)    A copy of the determination of the hearing examiner shall be hand
delivered to the person or mailed to the person by first class mail.
   (c)    Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this Section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten (10) days of the
date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default judgment
shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the City of Upper Sandusky and
the Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its
disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed
with the office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so filed, shall
have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered
in the Court.
   As required by Ohio R.C. 4521.08(C), judgments and default judgments filed
with the Wyandot County Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment roll from other

additional costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not exceeding ten
dollars ($10.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid upon satisfaction of
the judgment.

of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable
costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Court shall
schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with the
rules of the Court. Service of a notice of appeal under this subsection by a
person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default
judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files
the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the
judgment, plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of the
Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the Parking
Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Municipal Court may be
taken.
   (e)    A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this Section may
be filed with the Municipal Court, office of the Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, under subsection (c) hereof at any time within three (3) years after
the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking infraction out
of which the judgment arose. This subsection applies to any ticket issued for
an offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the: effective date
of this Section, if the ticket was issued within three (3) years prior to the
effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued and served on
the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
 
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.)
501.14 CONSPIRACY.

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Fair Housing Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)    If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary. The Board shall not dismiss such
complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to appear before
the Board.

susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed.

charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of
the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized counsel may
file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as it
deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be opened to the
public and shall be held not less than fifteen calendar days nor more than
thirty calendar days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The
summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance
of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      (2)    The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the
Board in person or by a duly authorized representative and may have the
assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and
the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and
evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation The Secretary shall keep a
full record of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection
by any person, and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the
Board shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as
the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines that the
person complained against has violated this chapter, the Board shall, after
consultation with the Law Director in executive session, state its findings to
and cause the Law Director to prepare and issue an order under Board directive
requiring the person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful
conduct and to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of
this chapter, with notice that if the Board upon investigation by the
Secretary, determines that the person complained against has not, after fifteen
calendar days following service of the Board's order, complied with the order,
the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought
in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines that the
person complained against has not violated this resolution, the Board shall so
state and publish its findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

The Mayor shall give his consent to the issuance of such license if he deems

where an admission fee, cover charge or its equivalent is required. The license

ball or dance to be given by or for the benefit of any purely civic,
benevolent, charitable, educational, religious society or organization, or by
and for the benefit of any society or organization genuinely and regularly
conducted for a purpose other than giving of balls or dances, provided that the
application for any such permit be applied for five days prior to the date of
the proposed ball or dance and any such dance shall be termed to be a private

   (b)    Each consumer shall be supplied through a separate meter, except,
however, in the case of property classified in subsections (d) and (e) of

supply and housing the metering device for each tenant. The controlling device
shall be outside of the building and the measuring device or meter shall be
properly and conveniently housed either outside or within the building.
   (c)    The consumer must provide suitable housing facilities for the meter,
and become responsible for any damage to the same through extreme heat or cold
or accidents, otherwise the Water Department shall maintain and keep the meter
in repair and adjustment.
   In case no suitable housing is to be had in the cellar or basement or about
the premises, the owner of the premises shall be required to furnish an
approved meter housing in a parkway, terrace or sidewalk of the premises, which
the Water Department shall install at a uniform price of twenty-five dollars

of public record and shall be repeated as often as the Water Department
Supervisor shall deem necessary.
   (d)   The Water Department Supervisor or his duly authorized representative
shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the City of
Upper Sandusky for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems
thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish to the Water Department Supervisor any information which he may
request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property.

937.04 BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS; PERMIT AND INSPECTION FEE.
   (a)    No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with or
openings into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the Municipality. A sewer service
connection to the public sewer may only be built by a person, firm or
corporation having qualifications approved by the Superintendent of Service.
Such person shall be required to prove to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent that he possesses the qualifications necessary for a competent
sewer builder.
   (b)    Before commencement of construction of any building sewer whether the
same is located on private or public property, the property owner shall obtain
a written permit from the Municipality. There shall be three classes of
building sewer permits:
      (1)    Residential;
      (2)    Commercial service and multiple-family residences; and
      (3)    For establishments producing industrial wastes.
   In any case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form
furnished by the Municipality. The permit application shall be accompanied and
supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered
necessary and pertinent in the judgment of the Superintendent. A permit and
inspection fee of five dollars ($5.00) for a resident, ten dollars ($10.00) for
a commercial building sewer or multiple-family service and ten dollars ($10.00)
for an industrial sewer permit shall be paid to the Municipality at the time
the application is filed. The Superintendent shall have the authority to
require increased permit and inspection fees in unusual cases, or in cases
where repeated inspections are required.
   However, no new permit shall be issued when it has been determined by the
Superintendent and/or the Director that there does not exist sufficient
capacity in the wastewater treatment system including collecting, pumping,
treating and disposing of wastes as may be discharged by the applicant of such
new permit.
   (c)    All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The property owner shall
indemnify the Municipality from any claims arising as a result of any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by installation of the
building sewer.
   (d)    A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building except where one building stands on the opposite side of the sewer
from another building on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be built to the far building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or
driveway, the building sewer from the structure nearest to the trunk sewer may
be extended to accommodate the far building and the whole considered as one
building sewer.
 
   (e)    As public sewers become available as stipulated in Section
937.02(d), and connections are made to the same, existing building sewers will
generally not be approved for further use. The Superintendent shall, however,
have the authority to approve the use of existing building sewers
notwithstanding deviations from the requirements set forth in subsection (f)
hereof for new building sewers if, in his opinion, the existing sewers are of
unusually high construction quality and in all around excellent condition. An
additional permit and inspection fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be charged
for persons seeking approval of the use of all or part of existing building
sewers, regardless of subsequent approval or rejection of the same. The
property owner shall, in addition, pay for or perform any testing or exposure
of existing lines for inspection deemed necessary by the Superintendent.
   (f)    The building sewers shall be vitrified clay sewer pipe ASTM
specification C 13 or C-200 with joints conforming to tentative ASTM
specification C-425, or approved equal. This pipe is commonly referred to as O-
ring joint pipe and is considered premium joint pipe. No other premium joint
pipe having a lesser permissible joint deflection (seven degrees) shall be
acceptable. Joints shall be made tight and waterproof to the Superintendent's
satisfaction. Cast iron pipe with leaded joints may be required by the
Superintendent where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If
installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast
iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a
suitable concrete bed or cradle satisfactory to the Superintendent.
 
   (g)    The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than
six inches. The slope of such six-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth
inch per linear foot, and the general requirements shall be for a slope of one-
quarter inch per linear foot where circumstances permit.
 
   (h)    No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of
any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient
to afford protection from frost and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform
grade and in a straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction
shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings, and cleanouts shall
be built at all changes of direction of forty-five degrees or more, and in any
event at least every seventy-five feet along all straight lines.

prevent foreign objects from being introduced into the sanitary sewers. Tees
shall not be permitted in any part of the sewer service connection. In order to
protect the Municipality's sewer system, the plumbing for all buildings shall
be installed in accordance with the minimum requirements of the Federal Housing
Administration and any applicable standards established by the State of Ohio.
This requirement is primarily intended to apply to new building construction;
however, the Superintendent may require corrective work on the plumbing systems
of any existing building where serious violations of accepted good practice in
plumbing are observed. Such corrective action shall be completed prior to
connection of the building sewer from the affected structure to the municipal
sewer system.
   (l)    The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the Y branch provided for the lot on which the building is located. The
greatest of care shall be exercised to produce a watertight job and to assure
that alignment of the sewer main is not disturbed. This work may be done only
by a properly approved person as specified in Section
937.04(a) and the cost of the same shall be borne by the property owner.
 
   (m)    The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Superintendent or his designated representative.

Section
939.11 shall apply to all such loadings exceeding the limitations herein.
   (i)    Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
 
   (j)    When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property served
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
 
   (k)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (c), (d) and (g) hereof
shall be determined in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency
Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants (Ref. FR 10-
16-73, Vol. 38, No. 199, Part II), and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided for in subsection (j) hereof, or upon suitable samples taken
at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected, or other locations as determined by the Superintendent.
 
   (l)   When determined by the Director and/or the Superintendent that certain
wastes and/or limitations heretofore prohibited by this chapter can be accepted
without detriment to the wastewater treatment system, the Municipality may
enter into special agreements with industry for the discharge of such wastes
deemed acceptable.
   Any agreement entered into under the provisions of this section shall
stipulate the type and amount of pollutant and/or conditions permitted
thereunder, the conditions of permitting such discharges and the amount of
surcharge in addition to applicable user's charge that will adequately
compensate the Municipality for all costs associated with collecting, pumping,
treating and disposing of such discharges.

   (b)    Users shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon accidentally
discharging wastes in violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures to be
taken to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment system, treatment
processes and the receiving waters.
   This notification shall be followed, within fifteen days of the date of
occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the causes of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrence.
   Such notification shall not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss
or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant or treatment process, or for any
fines imposed on the agency on account thereof.
 
   (c)   In order that employees of users be informed of municipal
requirements, users shall make available to their employees copies of this
chapter together with such other wastewater information and notices which may
be furnished by the Municipality from time to time directed toward more
effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently
posted on the user’s bulletin board advising employees whom to call in case of
an accidental discharge in violation of this chapter.
 
   (d)   Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or
deleterious wastes to the user’s plumbing or drainage system shall be
eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable the user shall
appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes
in violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 188-6. Passed 1-3-77.)
937.07 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)   The Superintendent shall make and enforce rules and regulations
subject to approval of Council and/or the Service Committee as they may
require, establishing the types and characteristics of sanitary sewage and
industrial wastes and other matters not specifically covered in this chapter
which shall not be discharged into the public sewer system, and the types and
characteristics of sanitary sewage and industrial wastes admissible to the
public sewer system only after pretreatment. Such rules and regulations shall
be subject to appeal to Council which shall appoint three reputable and
certified persons to investigate the appeal and agree to affirm or reject the
ruling of the Superintendent.

939.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms
used in this chapter shall be as defined in Chapter
937.
   (a)   “User’s charge” means the charge to each recipient of waste treatment
services within the City’s service area representing a proportionate share of
the costs of operation and maintenance, including replacement, of all waste
treatment service provided.
   (b)   “User’s class” means the division of users within the City’s service
area by the origin of the sewage discharged and by the similarity of the
function of such users.
   (c)   “Operation and maintenance costs” means all expenses of collecting,
pumping, treating and disposing of wastewater.
   (d)   “Replacement costs” means expenditures for obtaining and installing
equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary during the service
life of the treatment works to maintain the capacity and performance for which
such works were designed and constructed. Unless specifically excluded, the
term “operation and maintenance” shall include replacement.
      (Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.02 NECESSITY FOR USER’S CHARGE.
   It is necessary to recover from all users of the sewerage system the cost of
operation and maintenance including replacement and the recovery of such costs
must be in compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency
rules and regulations, published in the Federal Register, August 21, 1973 (38FR
22523). Therefore, every person, firm or corporation whose premises are served
by a sewer connection which discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into sewage facilities
under the jurisdiction of the City shall be charged for the use of such
facilities and for the treatment of such sewage and wastes. The user’s charge
shall be applied to each and every premise discharging into the sewerage
system.
(Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.03 CHARGES MAY CONSTITUTE A LIEN.
   Each user charge levied pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a lien upon
the premises charged therewith, and if the same is not paid within ninety days
after it is due and payable, it shall be certified to the County Auditor who
shall place the same on the tax duplicate, with the interest and penalties
allowed by law, and shall be collected as other municipal taxes are collected.
(Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Service Committee shall make and enforce such rules and regulations, as
it deems necessary for the enforcement of the provisions hereof, for the proper
determination and collection of the rates and charges herein provided and for
the safe, efficient and economical management of the system. Such rules and
regulations, when not repugnant to existing ordinances of the City or laws of
the State, shall have the same force and effect as ordinances of Council.
(Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.05 EVIDENCE OF SEWER SYSTEM USE.
   Where a sanitary sewer is available to any lot, parcel of land, building or
premises which are improved, it is a conclusive presumption that sewage from
such lot, parcel of land or premises which are improved, is discharged into
such sewer, and the premises or property shall be billed for sewage service
charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel of land or premises abutting a
street, alley or easement in which there is a public sanitary or combined sewer
shall be deemed to have available access to a sanitary sewer.
(Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)

fully paid.
(Ord. 79-13. Passed 3-16-20.)
939.08 MEASUREMENT OF USER’S SEWAGE FLOW.
   (a)   For any premises having a connection with the Municipality’s sewer
facilities, or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into such sewers and which are supplied
solely by the Municipality’s metered public water supply, such metered water
flows shall be used as the basis for determining the volume of sewage
discharged.
   (b)   For any such premises having connection with the aforesaid sewer
facilities, or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into such sewers and which are supplied
in part or in whole by a private water supply, the Service Committee and/or the
Superintendent, based on a consideration of similar premises and uses,
engineering factors and other relevant matters, may estimate the monthly or
quarterly amount of water to provide adequate water service to the premises for
the purpose and period for which nonmetered water is consumed and such estimate
shall be the basis for measuring the volume of sewage discharged. If the owner
of such premises or other interested party elects to do so, he may install at
his own expense water meters satisfactory to the Service Committee and/or
Superintendent to the extent necessary to measure all such supplies of water
and the quantity of water consumed on such premises. The aggregate amount
disclosed by such meters shall be the basis for measuring the volume of sewage
discharged.
   (c)    In the event that the Service Committee and/or the Superintendent are
satisfied that a portion of the water from any source consumed upon any
premises does not and cannot enter the aforesaid sewers, then in such case the
owner or other interested party may, at the owner's or other interested party's
expense, install and maintain such separate metering devices as shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Service Committee and/or the
Superintendent that portion of the water so consumed which is discharged into
the aforesaid sewers and such portion shall be the basis for measuring the
volume of sewage discharged.
(Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.09 BASIS FOR USER CHARGE COMPUTATIONS.
   At least once each year the Superintendent, based on the previous year's
records of operation, flows, loads, costs and water consumption, shall compute
or cause to be computed the following:
   (a)    The total yearly volume of sewage collected, conveyed and treated.
Such total yearly volume of sewage shall consist of the volumes as measured at
the sewage treatment plant.
   (b)    The total yearly volume of measured sewage flows. Such total yearly
volume shall consist of the sum of all volumes measured as provided in Section
939.08, and expressed in thousands of gallons.
   (c)    The estimated yearly volume of unknown sources flow. This estimated
yearly volume shall represent the difference of the volumes computed in
subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    The estimated annual total of pounds of BOD and SS received at the
wastewater treatment plant for removal. Based on normal strength limitations,
these volumes shall be further divided into percentages of loadings resulting
from normal strength discharges and extra strength discharges, according to the
volume established in subsection (b) hereof.
   (e)    The total number of users connected in or otherwise discharging
wastewater into the Municipality's sewerage system.
   (f)    The total number of bills for sewer service issued during the
previous year.
   (g)    The total yearly administrative costs, which shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to:
      (1)    Administrative salary costs (direct plus fringe benefits);
      (2)    Consulting fees: engineering, legal and financial;
      (3)    Administrative overhead costs (rent, telephone, utilities,
billings, collections, records, etc.);
      (4)    Miscellaneous costs (supplies, travel and subsistence, tuition
reimbursements, mailing, printing, etc.).
   (h)    The total yearly sewer operation and maintenance costs, which shall
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)    Salary costs (direct plus fringe benefits);
      (2)    Administrative overhead costs (same as subsection (g)(3) hereof);
      (3)    Materials, equipment repairs and rentals, supplies, inspection and
surveillance devices (gas, oil, pipelines, etc.);
      (4)    Miscellaneous costs (same as subsection (g)(4) hereof).
   (i)    The total yearly wastewater treatment operation and maintenance
costs, which shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)    Salary costs (direct plus fringe benefits);
      (2)    Administrative overhead costs (same as subsection (g)(3) hereof);
      (3)    Treatment costs (power, materials, equipment repair and rentals,
devices, chemicals, supplies, etc.);
      (4)    Miscellaneous costs (same as subsection (g)(4) hereof).
   (j)    The total annual estimated payment to the Wastewater Treatment Plant
Rehabilitation and Replacement Fund.
   (k)   The total annual estimated payment to the Collection System
Rehabilitation and Replacement Fund.
   (l)    The total annual sewerage system expenditures, which shall be
represented by the sum of all of the costs and payments as computed in
subsections (g) through (k) hereof.
   (m)    The aggregate sum of the expenses established in subsections (i) and
(j) hereof shall be divided into three equal shares, one of which shall be
assigned to flow handling, one to BOD removal and the third to SS removal. The
flow handling share shall be further divided by taking sixty percent of the
percentage arrived at by dividing the value obtained in subsection (c) hereof
by the value obtained in subsection (a) hereof times the flow handling share,
the resulting sum to then be collected by a charge per connection. The
remaining portion of the flow handling share shall be recovered on a volumetric
rate basis. The BOD and SS removal shares each shall be further divided by
taking the percentage of each which is determined to result from normal
strength discharges as computed in subsection (d) hereof times their respective
shares, the sums of which shall be recovered on the volumetric rate basis. The
remaining amounts of each share shall be recovered through the extra strength
surcharges established herein.
   (n)    The aggregate sum of expense established in subsections (h) and (k)
hereof shall be assigned solely to flow handling, This sum shall be further
divided into two parts by the identical formula used to similarly divide the
flow handling share established in subsection (m) hereof, the two sums being
recovered by the respective means stated in (m).
   (o)    The aggregate sum of expense as established by subsection (g) hereof
shall be divided by the value determined in subsection (f) hereof, the quotient
of which shall be an incremental charge per monthly and/or quarterly bill.
   (p)    The aggregate sum of expense to be recovered on a connection basis as
established in subsection (m) and (n) hereof shall be divided by the value as

939.10 ANNUAL AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES REQUIRED.
   On or before February 1, 1978, and each year thereafter on or before
February 1, the Superintendent shall submit to the Service Committee a
recommended system of user charges for approval. If approved, the Service
Committee shall submit the sewer use charge schedule to the first regular
meeting thereafter of Council for ratification and incorporation into the
municipal ordinances. The system shall be in accordance with the following
requirements:
   (a)    The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of operation
and maintenance of the treatment works within the Department's jurisdiction to
each user class in proportion to such user's contribution to the total
wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance, including replacement costs to each user's class.
   (b)    The system of charges shall be reviewed annually and revised
periodically to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs.
   (c)    The system of charges shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the
costs of all treatment works operation and maintenance provided by the
Department and such other expenditures that may be authorized.
      (Ord. 179-6. Passed 11-15-76.)
939.11 ADDITIONAL SURCHARGE FOR EXTRA STRENGTH WASTES.
   (a)    Any person, firm or corporation served by a sewer connection which
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the
wastewater treatment system which are of unusual strength, volume or character,
but acceptable by the municipality for treatment, shall be subject to an
additional surcharge which shall be over and above the rates and charges
established by subsections (o),(p) and (q) of Section
939.09.
   (b)    The surcharge shall be effective if any or all of the following are
exceeded:
      (1)    A five-day BOD greater than 300 mg/l by weight.
      (2)    Suspended solids greater than 300 mg/l by weight.
   (c)    The surcharge shall be calculated annually as provided for in
subsection (r) of Section
939.09 to be effective January 1 of each year. Based on the results of tests
and measurements made by the Municipality during the preceding year:
 
Annual Surcharge =    (Bw X $0.0806) + (Sw X $0.0931)
Where:
   Bw =       The annual pounds of BOD discharged in excess of 300 mg/1; and
   Sw=       The annual pounds of suspended solids discharged in excess of 300 mg/l.
   (d)    When required by the Service Committee, the owner of any property
discharging such wastes shall install a suitable chamber with gauging and
sampling equipment in the building sewer to permit observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes from his premises. Such chamber and equipment shall
be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Service Committee and
shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him.
   (e)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of such
wastes shall be determined by the Municipality in accordance with the latest
edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage, as
prepared, approved and published jointly by the American Public Health
Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution
Control Federation.
   (f)    The strength of the wastes shall be determined from samples taken at
the aforementioned chamber at any period or time and of such duration and in
such manner as the Municipality may elect, or, at any place mutually agreed
upon between the owner and the Municipality. The results of routine sampling
and analysis by the owner may also be used in determining the amount of the
surcharge after verification by the Municipality. The strength so found by
analysis shall be used in determining the amount of the surcharge.
   (g)    The Municipality shall have the right to enter and set up, on company
property, such devices as are necessary to conduct a gauging and sampling
operation and to begin such operation without advance notice to the company.
While performing the work, the Municipality shall observe all safety rules,
applicable to the premises, established by the company.
   Where a company or premise has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into such company or premise
is granted, such company or premise shall either make the necessary
arrangements with their security guards that upon showing proper identification
personnel from the Municipality shall be permitted to enter, without delays,
for the purpose of obtaining grab samples of wastes being discharged at the
various sampling points; or the company or premise shall install suitable
gauging and sampling manholes outside the security limits which manholes shall
at all times be immediately accessible to municipal personnel.
   (h)   If a person, firm or corporation disagrees with the analysis on which
the surcharge is based, he or it may request, in writing, an additional
sampling and analysis which shall be conducted in a manner acceptable to the
Service Committee and or the Superintendent. The cost of such additional
sampling and analysis shall be borne in full by the requestor.

stormwater to the sewage system shall be disconnected above ground in a manner
approved by the Wastewater Supervisor. No sump pumps shall discharge any
unpolluted stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process water
to the sewage system.
(Ord. 25-13. Passed 12-16-24.)
   940.03 SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   The following described substances, material, waters or wastes shall
be limited to discharge to the City's sewage system to concentrations or
quantities which will not cause interference or harm to either the sewers,
sewage treatment process or equipment; will not have an adverse effect after
treatment on the receiving stream; will not cause violations of the NPDES
permit, requirements or regulations; or will not endanger the public's lives or
property or constitute a nuisance. The Wastewater Supervisor may set
limitations more severe than the following if such limitations are necessary to
meet the above objectives. These local limits may be found in the Upper
Sandusky Local Limits Document, the most recent technologically based local
limits evaluation as approved by the Ohio EPA. In setting these limitations to
the acceptability, the Wastewater Supervisor will give consideration to such
factors as the quantity of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities
in the sewers, materials or construction of sewers, the wastewater treatment
processes employed, the capacity of the Water Reclamation Facility and its
sludge recycling program, the degree of treatability of the wastes, and other
pertinent factors, including cost effectiveness.
      (1)   When limits in a Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms
in mass pollutant per limit of production, the Wastewater Supervisor may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutants discharged per day or effluent concentrations for purpose of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users
(IU).
      (2)   Any IU operating under an Industrial User Discharge Permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production based standard shall notify the Wastewater Supervisor within two (2)
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production
level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Failure to
adequately notify the Wastewater Supervisor will require the IU to meet the
mass or concentration limits in its Industrial User Discharge Permit that were
based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.
   (b)   The limitations included in this chapter or restrictions of materials
or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sewage system which
will not be violated without the approval of the Wastewater Supervisor are as
follows:
      (1)   Industrial wastes containing floatable oil, fat or grease. Any
water or waste containing non-emulsified fats, wax, grease or oils, in excess
of one hundred (100) mg/l or containing substances which may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees and 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
      (2)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
      (4)   Any wastewater which, by interaction with other water or wastes in
sewage system releases obnoxious gases, forms suspended solids which interfere
with the sewage system, or creates a condition injurious to structures and
treatment processes. The Wastewater Supervisor shall require all discharges to
conform to all NPDES permit requirements and any other applicable State or
Federal requirements.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes that create a hazard to humans or animals or
creates any hazard in the receiving waters of the Water Reclamation Facility,
or directly causes the City of Upper Sandusky to violate its NPDES permit.
         While direct limits for these wastes are usually included in a
Industrial User Discharge Permit, those users that are not required to have a
Industrial User Discharge Permit or that do not have a specific limit listed in
the Industrial User Discharge Permit shall not exceed background concentrations
of these wastes.
         These concentrations may be changed as necessary pursuant to
applicable promulgated limiting concentrations established by State or Federal
agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-lives or
concentrations to exceed State or Federal regulations and the following:
         Gross beta activity shall not exceed 1,000 picocuries per liter.
         Activity from dissolved strontium 90 shall not exceed 10 picocuries
per liter.
         Activity from dissolved alpha emitters shall not exceed three
picocuries per liter.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute "slug"
as defined in Section
940.01(a) (30).
      (8)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Wastewater Supervisor, as necessary, to meet the
requirements of state, federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for
such discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any gasoline, benzene, kerosene, hexene, naphtha, fuel oil or other
solid or gas, which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be
sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fires
or explosions or be injurious in any way to the waste water system. At no time
shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of
discharge into the wastewater system, be more than fifteen percent (15%) nor
any single reading more than twenty percent (20%) of the lower explosive limit
(L.E.L.).
      (10)   Any ashes, cinder, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, animal parts, whole blood, paunch manure, tar, plastics, wood or any
solid or viscous substance capable of causing obstructions to the flow in
sewers or other interference with the proper operation of the sewerage works.
      (11)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes
or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.
      (12)    Any waters or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement.
      (13)    Materials which exert or cause:
         Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as but not
limited to fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
         Excessive discoloration (such as but not limited to dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions).
      (14)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (15)   Any water or waste having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.0
or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment and personnel of the sewerage works.
      (16)   Any waste or wastewater classified as a hazardous waste by the

sewage system contains the substances or characteristics herein described, the
Wastewater Supervisor may:
      (1)   Suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or Industrial User
Discharge Permit when such suspension is necessary, in order to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, causes interference to the Water
Reclamation Facility or its sludge program or causes the City to violate its
NPDES permit. Any person or Significant Industrial User (SIU) notified of the
suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the Industrial User Discharge
Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of
failure of the person or SIU to comply voluntarily with the suspension order,
the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate
severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the sewage
system or endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the
Industrial User Discharge Permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written
statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be
submitted to the City within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition or acceptable
amount of contaminant before discharge into the sewage system;
      (3)   Require payment to cover added costs of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing charges;

945.02 PURPOSE.
   Council has adopted this chapter for the purpose of establishing feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of management and
conservation practices which will abate erosion of the soil and abate the
degradation of the waters of the State by soil sediment in conjunction with
nonfarm, earth-disturbing activities. It is the further intent of this chapter
to:
   (a)   Permit development without increasing downstream flooding, erosion or
sedimentation.
   (b)   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity
which may be caused by increase in the quantity and/or rate of water
discharged.
   (c)   Establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems which
will preserve the rights and options of both the dominant and serviant property
owners and help assure the long term adequacy of storm drainage systems.

the same person or their successor in title in the same immediate vicinity
either or both of which when combined with the current earth-disturbing
activities result in disturbing 5,000 or more square feet.
      (Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.06 WAIVERS.
   (a)   Certain earth-disturbing activities not automatically subject to
exemptions by Section
945.04 may exist for which the submission of a stormwater control plan serves
no real purpose. Such activity shall be eligible for a waiver from the
requirement of submitting a plan and/or other requirements of this chapter.
 
   (b)   To obtain a waiver, a person shall submit a written request to the
Consulting Engineer and Service Committee and/or Superintendent of Services.
This request shall include sufficient data to determine that granting a waiver
will not result in excessive stormwater runoff or rate of runoff.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.07 PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   The Service Committee shall review the stormwater management plan or
drainage plan within thirty days of receipt and indicate their approval or
disapproval to the person who filed the plan. Indication of disapproval shall
include the plan deficiencies and the procedure for filing a revised plan.
Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, earth-disturbing activities
shall not be allowed until the deficiencies have been properly addressed and an
acceptable plan has been filed and approved.
 
   (b)   During the plan review, the Service Committee may request
recommendations pertaining to the proposed plan from the Wyandot County Soil
and Water Conservation District, and the City Planning Commission. The City's
Consulting Engineer shall be responsible for review and approval of all
hydrological and runoff calculations as well as design and construction
inspection for all stormwater management facilities.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.08 PERMITS.
   (a)   Permit application forms will be made available at the Mayor's Office.

amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) or one percent (1%) of the
construction costs estimates for the stormwater management facilities,
whichever is greater, shall be paid to the City Auditor before issuance of the
stormwater management permit to offset the costs of plan review and field
inspection of such construction to assure its conformance with the plans.
 
   (b)   No permit fee will be required for nonfarm, earth-disturbing
activities which have been provided for in an already approved stormwater
management plan (i.e., home construction on a lot in an approved subdivision
with an approved stormwater management plan).
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.10 ASSURANCE OF COMPLETION.
   (a)   The assurance of completion of the stormwater drainage facilities and
control structures included in a stormwater management plan or drainage plan
which has been developed and approved under this chapter shall be satisfied by
the furnishing of a one hundred percent (100%) performance bond or other
satisfactory security. The Consulting Engineer and Service Committee and/or
Superintendent of Services shall approve the sufficiency of the bond and the
Law Director shall approve the bond as to form.
 
   (b)   Storm drainage facilities and control structures that are being
constructed as part of a subdivision subject to the subdivision regulations of
the City shall be considered as an improvement. As such they shall be subject
to the bonding requirements therein and this section of the Stormwater
Management Regulations shall be waived. The value of the stormwater drainage
facilities shall be included in the amount of the performance bond for the
subdivision improvements.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.11 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under provisions of this chapter nor compliance
with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from responsibility

liability upon the City for damage to any person or property.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
 
945.12 SURVEILLANCE AND COMPLIANCE.
   The Consulting Engineer and Service Committee and/or Superintendent of
Services shall inspect land disturbance areas during construction to determine
compliance with this chapter. If it is determined that a violation of this
chapter exists, the responsible person shall be notified of the deficiencies or
noncompliance in writing and by certified mail. If within one week after
receipt of the letter for compliance, the deficiency or noncompliance has not
been corrected or substantial steps taken to correct same, the deficiency or
noncompliance shall be reported to the Law Director for legal action.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
 
945.13 CALCULATING STORMWATER RUNOFF.
   One of the four methods described in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55, by the Soil Conservation Service of the United
States Department of Agriculture and its Ohio Supplement shall be used to
determine stormwater runoff. Such release is specifically incorporated within
this chapter by reference.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
 
945.14 STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL CRITERIA.
   Stormwater runoff control addresses both peak rate and total volume of
runoff.
   (a)   The peak rate of runoff from an area after development shall not
exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area before development for all
storms up to a 100 year frequency, twenty-four hour storm. In addition, if it
is found a proposed development will increase the volume of runoff from an
area, the peak rate of runoff from certain more frequent storms must be
controlled further. There are two reasons why increases in volume of runoff
require a control standard more restrictive than controlling just the
predevelopment conditions. First, increases in volume mean runoff will be
flowing for longer period of time. When routed through a watershed, these
longer flows may join at some point downstream; thereby creating peak flows and
the problem associated with peak flow (flooding). This is known as the "routing
problem". Second, longer flow periods of large runoff quantities place a highly
erosive stress on natural channels. This stress can be minimized by reducing
the rate of discharge. The permissible peak rate shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm occurring over the area before and after development.
      (2)   Determine the percent of increase in volume due to development and
using this percentage pick the critical storm from the following table:
 
If the percentage of increase   The critical storm for discharge
in volume of runoff is   limitation will be
Equal to   Less than
or
greater
than
-   10   1 year
10   20   2 years
20   50   5 years
50   100   10 years
100   250   25 years
250   500   50 years
500   -   100 years
   (b)   The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the
development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one-year frequency
storm occurring over the same area predevelopment conditions. Storms of less
frequent occurrence (longer return period) than for the same storm shall have
peak rate of runoff not greater than for the same storm under predevelopment
conditions. As an example, if the total volume is shown to be increased by
thirty-five percent (35%) the critical storm is a five year storm. The peak
rate of runoff for all storms up to this intensity shall be controlled so as
not to exceed the peak of runoff from a one-year frequency storm under
predevelopment conditions in the area. The runoff from a more intense storm
need only be controlled so as not to exceed the predevelopment peak rate from
the same frequency of storm.
   (c)   Storage volume does not have to provide for off-site upstream area.
Flow from such areas will be routed through the drainage system in the
development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the
on-site system.
      (Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.15 PREPARING A STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   (a)   A stormwater management plan is required for developments involving
5,000 square feet of earth-disturbing activity or more.
 
   (b)   The plan submission shall include but not necessarily be limited to a
one-inch = 100 foot scale topographic map with two foot contour intervals,
drainage pattern and major soil types information, complete predevelopment and
post development drainage calculations and detail engineering drawings,
specifications and estimates for the stormwater management control structures
and drainage facilities to be constructed as part of the development.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.16 MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER DRAINAGE FACILITIES AND CONTROL STRUCTURES.
   When stormwater drainage facilities and control structures are of permanent
nature the City may assume responsibility for such structures located within
the corporation limits once they have been constructed and accepted by the
City. Funding for the maintenance of these major facilities may be by
assessment of property owners in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code. The
maintenance of minor detention areas such as swales, etc. on individual parcels
or lots in new subdivisions shall be the responsibility of the individual
parcel or lot owners. Special provisions shall be written into the deeds for
the individual parcels or lots in new subdivisions so the owners are aware the
parcels or lots are used for temporary stormwater storage. The City will
require all of these stormwater drainage facilities and control structures to
be designed to minimize maintenance costs. The property owner or owners shall
provide all necessary easements and rights of way to the City in order to
permit the maintenance and repair of the required stormwater drainage
facilities and control structures.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.17 SEVERABILITY.
   If any clause, section or provision of this chapter is declared invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 122-9. Passed 2-21-94.)
945.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
each offense. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the remedy of any such
violation.

951.01 NECESSITY FOR COLLECTION SYSTEM.
   In order to comply with the laws of the State of Ohio and the rules,
regulations and directives of the State and local departments of health and to
utilize the services and facilities of the established landfill disposal
grounds made available through the office of the County Commissioners, it is
necessary to establish a collection system for the Municipality and for the
purpose of collecting and disposing of all garbage, refuse and waste materials
accumulating within the Municipality and to dispose of the same in the landfill
disposal grounds. The Service Department shall therefore acquire the necessary
disposal equipment for such collection service and cause the same to be
properly manned with personnel for door-to-door collection of such garbage,
refuse and waste materials.
(Ord. 231-5. Passed 9-16-68.)
 
951.02 TYPES OF SERVICE RENDERED.
   There shall be three general types of service rendered in the collection of
all garbage, refuse and waste materials:
   (a)   Regular service shall be that type of service provided on regular
routes to be traveled on certain designated days in the business and
residential districts as may be designated and defined by the Service
Department.
   (b)   Commercial service shall be that type of service provided to
commercial establishments on certain designated days of the week as agreed upon
between the customer and the Service Department.
   (c)   Special service shall be that service performed in addition to the
regular or commercial service and such service shall be performed by special
request at times most convenient to the collecting agency and under rates as
may be agreed upon or negotiated between the customer and the Service
Department.
      (Ord. 231-5. Passed 9-16-68.)
951.03 SERVICE OUTSIDE THE MUNICIPALITY; SURCHARGE.
   The Service Committee may, unless restrained by action of Council, permit
the collection service to be extended outside of the corporate limits of the
Municipality. Inasmuch as the service is established primarily for the benefit
of the residents of the Municipality, the right to discontinue nonresident
services upon reasonable notice is reserved by the Municipality.
(Ord. 231-5. Passed 9-16-68.)
951.04 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   Application for regular or commercial service and for special services where
needed shall be made at the office of the City Water Department and upon
subscribing for such services, the applicant agrees to abide by the rules and
regulations as approved by the Service Committee and to pay the established
rate for the regular and commercial services or the negotiated rate for the
special services.
(Ord. 231-5. Passed 9-16-68.)
951.05 WRAPPING GARBAGE; RECEPTACLES.
   (a)   All persons subscribing for the regular sanitation collection service
or the commercial service or desiring special sanitation service as defined in
Section
951.02 must provide metal or satisfactory plastic garbage containers with tight
lids as receptacles for all garbage and all such garbage must be wrapped in
paper or placed in sacks before being disposed of in such garbage cans or other
sanitary receptacles. All refuse or waste materials must be placed in baskets,
boxes or other satisfactory receptacles which are sufficiently constructed so
as to retain such materials without breaking and so as to be readily handled by
the refuse collectors and carried or lifted into the disposal truck.
 
   (b)   All persons subscribing for the regular sanitation collection service
shall on the day designated for the collection within their geographic
district, place such cans, baskets or boxes at the curb in front of their
respective residences in order that such collection may be made from the street
adjoining the customer's property or residence. Each commercial customer shall
place all garbage, refuse or waste materials so as to be readily available to
the satisfaction of the employees of the collection service.
 
   (c)   For the regular collection service, each family shall constitute a
single customer for the regular established service rate and shall be charged
on a quarterly basis. Each such customer shall be entitled to one twenty-gallon
garbage can and three bushel baskets or their equivalent of other refuse and
waste materials for each collection. Any customer having in excess of the above
quantity at any one collection shall be charged for such extra quantity as may
be determined by the employees in charge of the collection service.
 
   (d)   For the regular commercial service, each commercial business shall
constitute a single customer for which the regular established service rate
shall be charged and for the regular service charge, each such customer shall
be entitled to four thirty-gallon garbage cans and one cubic yard of other
refuse or waste materials. Any customer having in excess of the above quantity
on any one collection shall be charged for such extra quantity as may be
determined by the employees in charge of the collection service.
(Ord. 231-5. Passed 9-16-68.)

convenience to the applicant.

classification of property, now or hereafter established by this Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)

of property as shown on the Zoning Map, or requests for any change in the text
of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission at its

the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented with the
application. Applications for amendments initiated by the Commission or Council
shall be accompanied by its motion pertaining to such proposed amendment.
   (b)    Before submitting its recommendations on a proposed amendment to
Council, the Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which
shall be given at least fifteen days in advance of the hearing date by one
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area. The notice shall
state the place or places and times at which the proposed amendment to the

   (c)    In addition to the published notice as hereinbefore specified, the
Commission shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of public hearings
to be held by it on proposed amendments or supplements by mailing a postal card
or letter of notice not less than ten days prior to the date of hearing, to the
owners of all property lying within 200 feet of any part of the property
proposed to be changed. The failure to notify as provided in this section,
shall not invalidate any recommendation adopted hereunder, it being the
intention of this section to provide notices to the persons substantially
interested in the proposed change that an application is pending before the
Commission, to make a change in the Zoning Map or the regulations set forth in
this Ordinance. If more than ten parcels of land are affected by proposed
amendments, the requirements for notices in this section shall not apply.
   (d)    The Commission may recommend that the application be granted as
requested, or it may recommend a modification of the zoning amendment
requested, or it may recommend that the application not be granted. These
recommendations shall then be certified to Council within five days of the

Council within thirty days after receipt of the application or motion,
whichever is the case.
   (e)    After receiving from the Commission, the certification of the
recommendations of the Commission on the proposed amendment, and before
adoption of such amendment, Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, at
least thirty days notice of the time and place of which shall be given by one
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area.
   (f)    In addition to the published notice, the Clerk of Council shall by
first class mail give written notice of the public hearing to affected property
owners if the amendment involves ten or less parcel of land, as listed on the
tax duplicate. "Affected Owners" means those owners of property within and
contiguous to and directly across the street from the involved parcel. This
notice shall be mailed to the owners' addresses as they appear on the County
Auditor's current list or the Treasurer's mailing list, and any other lists as
required by Council. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate the decision of the Council regarding the amendment or modification.
   (g)    After completion of the hearing required in subsection (e) hereof
Council shall consider such recommendations and facts as it may have had
presented to it, and thereafter vote on the passage of the proposed amendment
or modification thereof. Council may overrule or modify the recommendations of
the Commission only as provided in Section
5.12 of the Charter.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)

CHAPTER 1135
Nonconformance
1135.01   Buildings.
1135.02   Abandoned service stations.
1135.03   Use of the land.
1135.04   Special uses.
1135.05   Nonconforming standards of conforming or nonconforming uses.
1135.06   Lot area, width and depth.
 
1135.01 BUILDINGS.
   (a)    The lawful use of any building which does not conform to these
regulations, whether by original adoption or by subsequent amendment, may be
continued after such adoption or amendment, under the conditions herein
specified.
   (b)    The addition to, enlargement or expansion of any such nonconforming
building may be permitted, provided such addition, enlargement or expansion
complies with all height, area, parking setback and other requirements of the
district in which it is located, and that total aggregate floor area of such
additions does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the floor area in such
building at the time it became nonconforming.
   (c)    A nonconforming building or structure which is damaged or partially
destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity, or the public
enemy, may be restored and the same use and occupancy continued or resumed,
provided that such restoration is started within a period of one (1) year and
is diligently prosecuted to completion. Any lot whose buildings are destroyed
beyond ninety percent (90%) of their total value, shall not be restored to its
original use and the land use by such buildings shall thereafter be used in
conformance with the district regulations.
   (d)    The use of a nonconforming building may be changed to a use of the
same or more restricted classification but shall not thereafter be changed back
to a less restrictive use.
   (e)    A nonconforming building, or portion thereof, which is or hereafter
remains vacant and unoccupied for a period of two years or more, shall not
thereafter be occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of
the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1135.02  ABANDONED SERVICE STATIONS.
   (a)    If any service station shall become abandoned, such service station
shall be presumed to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, property or general welfare of the community and shall be abated.
"Abandoned" is defined as a failure to operate such service station for a
period of one year.
   (b)    Whenever the Administrative Officer finds any service station to be
abandoned within the meaning of this section, he shall give notice in the same
manner as service of summons in civil cases, or by certified mail addressed to
the owner of record of the premises at his last known address, or to the
address to which tax bills are sent or by a combination of the foregoing
methods, to abate such abandoned condition within one hundred and eighty (180)
days either by placing the station in operation in accordance with the Zoning
Ordinance, adapting and using the building for another permitted business use
or by removing the pumps and signs, abandoning underground storage tanks in
accordance with accepted safe practice as prescribed by the National Fire
Protection Association in Appendix "C" to N.F.P.A. No. 30 under the supervision
of the City and filling depressions to the grade level of the lot. However, if
the station is in operation at the time notice is given and remains in
operation for ninety (90) consecutive days thereafter, the provisions of this
section shall not apply, and provided further, that if there should be declared
a national emergency which would curtail the operation of motor vehicles or if
Council should determine that there exists a state of general economic
depression, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
   Upon failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the notice to
abate such abandonment, the Administrative Officer shall take such action as
may be necessary to abate such nuisance.
   (c)    Inoperative service stations which do not come within the definition
of abandoned service station shall be maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance and the owner shall cut all grass and remove all
rubbish and woods from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles upon such
premises shall be prohibited and the owner shall place in the window of such
service station a sign of at least ten square feet in area notifying the public
of this fact. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, if the
Administrative Officer shall find that such notice is not complied with by the
public, he may order the owner of the premises on which any station is
inoperative for more than six months to install fencing or barricades which
will be sufficient to block motor vehicle access to such property.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1135.03 USE OF THE LAND.
   (a)    A nonconforming use of open land, where no primary building is
involved, shall not be expanded or extended into any other part of the lot or
adjoining property, nor shall the use be changed except to a conforming use.
   (b)    A nonconforming use of land, where principal buildings are involved,
shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of the lot or any
adjacent lot, and use of such land that exists at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance and any subsequent amendment may be changed only as specified for
changes in use of nonconforming buildings as specified in Section
1135.01, provided such change in use is due to a change in use of the principal
building.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1135.04  SPECIAL USES.
   Any use herein shown as a special use in the district use regulations shall
be considered nonconforming uses in the same manner as other uses specified in
Sections
1135.01 and
1135.03, and shall be legal uses, and may be expanded only after approval of
such expansion as a special use under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1135.05 NONCONFORMING STANDARDS OF CONFORMING OR NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any uses, whether conforming as to use regulations or not, that do not
conform to the regulations herein pertaining to yard requirements, lot
requirements, off-street parking, height regulations and other regulations,
shall be permitted to continue under such nonconforming conditions, except that
any enlargement, change of use or addition shall not cause the aggregate use to
violate the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance beyond such existing
nonconformance which exists at the time of adoption of the Ordinance or any
subsequent amendment.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1135.06 LOT AREA, WIDTH AND DEPTH.
   Any lot of record, existing at the time of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance,
or any subsequent amendment, where the required lot area, width and depth do
not meet the regulations herein, may be used for residential purposes, provided
that yard, coverage and other requirements are met, and provided that any
contiguous land in common ownership be required to be used to meet the district
lot area, width and depth requirements and that no portion of such be
transferred to other ownership, if such transfer reduces the lot below the
minimum requirements set forth in this Ordinance.

(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1136.03 PERIMETER LANDSCAPING.
   (a)    When Required.
      (1)   Landscaping as regulated herein shall be required in all new
building development and construction in any business, office, manufacturing,
or public facilities district.
      (2)    Such landscaping shall also be required when substantial additions
to an existing building or parking facility are made. "Substantial additions"
means an increase in size of the structure or parking facility in relation to
the size of the existing structure or facility per the following table:
 
When Existing       "Substantial Increase"
Structure Or          Is An Addition
Facility Is . . .         Of . . .
0 - 1,000 Sq. Ft.       50% Or Greater

applicable to the Upper Sandusky area.
   (c)    Deciduous trees used shall be of species having an average mature
crown spread greater than fifteen (15) feet in northwestern Ohio. When used in
areas requiring visibility, only those species which also have trunks which can
be maintained with over six (6) feet of clear wood may be used. A minimum
caliper (measured six (6) inches above the ground) of at least two and one-half
(2 1/2) inches at the time of installation shall be required.
   Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or
other works shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15) feet to such public
works, unless the tree root system is completely contained within a barrier.
The barrier should have a minimum interior being five (5) feet square and five
(5) feet deep and for which the construction requirements shall be four (4)
inches thick reinforced concrete. (A listing of acceptable deciduous trees can
be found in the
Appendix following this chapter.)
   (d)    Evergreen trees used shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height
with a minimum caliper of two inches at the time of installation.
   (e)    Shrubs and hedges used shall be at least two (2) feet in average
height when planted.
   (f)    Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of a
landscaping area not occupied by other landscape material. Grass of the fescue
or bluegrass family shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent
lawns in Northern Ohio. They may be sodded or seeded, except in swales or other
areas subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable
mulch shall be used.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
1136.05 LANDSCAPE PLAN SUBMISSION.
   (a)    A landscape plan illustrating fulfillment of these requirements shall
be submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission prior to the issuance

regulations shall be included on such site plan.
   (b)    The contents of the plan shall include the following:
      (1)   Plot plan, drawn to an easily readable scale no smaller than one
inch equals fifty feet, showing and labeling by name and dimensions all
existing and proposed: property lines; easements; buildings and other
structures; parking facilities, including parking stalls, driveways, service
areas, square footage, etc.; locations of structures of adjoining parcels where
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission; water outlets; landscape material,
including botanical name and common name, installation size, probable mature
size, on center planting dimensions (where applicable), and quantities for all
plants used; and all existing trees.
      (2)    Title block with pertinent names and addresses, property owner,
person drawing plan, scale, date, north arrow, and zoning district.
         (Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)

or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year or by the next
planting period, whichever comes first, while other defective landscape
material shall be replaced or repaired within three (3) months.
(Ord. 113-9. Passed 1-17-94.)
   (b)   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (b) was repealed by Ordinance 117-
13, passed August 16, 2021.)
APPENDIX A
RECOMMENDED AND UNDESIRABLE DECIDUOUS TREES
I.    Recommended Deciduous Trees.
   The following section is designed to encourage an imaginative selection of
landscape trees. Careful selection will prevent an over-dependence on a few
species. This compilation will be useful to residents, nurserymen,
horticulturists, landscapers, developers and landscape architects. Planting and
maintaining a diverse urban forest is the goal of Upper Sandusky's tree
programs. Therefore, the following table is to be used as a guide rather than a
mandatory planting list.
   The list is divided into three size categories: Large trees which mature at
a height of fifty (50) feet or more (Group A); medium trees reaching a mature
height between thirty (30) and fifty (50) feet (Group B); and smal trees which
range from ten (10) to thirty (30) feet at maturity (Group C). Tree lawn sizes
must accommodate the tree size planted: Group A, greater than seven (7) feet;
Group B, four (4) to seven (7) feet and Group C, three (3) to four (4) feet.
Use under utility lines is limited to small trees, although medium trees may be
planted as close as ten ( 10) later feet to utility lines.
   The approximate mature height and diameter of each tree's crown are given.
   Trees are alphabetized by their scientific name with the common name given.
Cultivars best suited to Northern Ohio are also provided. An asterisked (*)
entry indicates a tree which is unsuitable for planting within fifteen (15)
later feet of a sidewalk or bikeway.
   Habit refers to the three-dimensional form of the tree. Five (5) general
terms describe the characteristic shape of the trees:
GLOBULAR    OVOID    CONICAL    OBOVOID    IRREGULAR
   The tolerance category presents information from various sources. The tree's
relative tolerance to insects, diseases, pollution and soil conditions are
signified by either a "Y" meaning yes, it is tolerant; "N", meaning no, it is
not tolerant; or "--", meaning no information is available from these sources.
   The comments pertain to any other notable character of the tree.

1311.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   Public Nuisance. Any fence, wall, garage, shed, house, building,
structure, tree, pole, smokestack or any excavation, basement, cellar, well,
cistern or sidewalk subspace or part thereof shall be deemed a "public
nuisance" if it by reason of the condition in which the same is permitted to be
or remain, it endangers the health, life, limb or property, or causes any hurt,
harm, inconvenience, discomfort, damage or injury to any one or more persons in
the City in any one or more of the following particulars:
      (1)   By reason of being injurious to or a menace to the public health,
safety or welfare;
      (2)   By reason of being a fire hazard;
      (3)   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy, or use on, in, upon, about
or around the above premises;
      (4)   By reason of continued vacancy thereby resulting in lack of
reasonable or adequate maintenance of structures and grounds and causing
deterioration and blighting influence on nearby properties and thereby
depreciating the enjoyment and use of the property in the immediate vicinity to
such an extent that it is harmful to the community in which such structure is
situated; or
      (5)   By reason of being unsanitary.
   (b)   Unsanitary. Any structure or building, or any portion thereof, used
for human habitation shall be deemed to be in an unsanitary condition when:
      (1)   Any portion of such building is infected with a communicable
disease, or has no toilet facilities as required by law or ordinance, or by
reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or thereon; or
      (2)   It is unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or
harmful to the lives or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited
portion of the house being damp or wet or in such lack of repair, or has such
accumulation of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous
substances or liquids, or by reason of such defects in or lack of repair of or
improper use of the drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or due to the existence
on the premises of a nuisance or other condition as is likely to cause sickness
among the occupants.
   (c)   Unsafe. All buildings or structures or any portion thereof which are
structurally unsafe or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to
existing use constitute a hazard to health by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation or obsolescence are "unsafe buildings".
   (d)   Owner. "Owner" or "owners" means the owner of record in the premises
in fee or of a lesser estate therein, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, land
installment contract vendee, assignee of the rents, receiver, executor,

of a building or their duly authorized agents. Any such person thus
representing the owner shall be bound to comply with the provisions of this
chapter to the same extent as if he were the owner.

   (a)   Whenever the Building Inspectors suspect the existence in the City of
a public nuisance, as defined in Section
1311.01, they shall promptly cause the premises on which they suspect such
public nuisance exists to be inspected. Should the Building Inspectors
determine that a public nuisance does exist, they shall cause photographs of
such nuisances to be made and to file and to be kept in the Mayor's Office the
written reports of the findings of the aforesaid inspection.
   (b)   If the Building Inspectors find that a public nuisance does exist,
they shall give written notice to the owner or owners and to the persons
occupying such building or structure or portion thereof if they are not the
owners. The written notice shall specifically state the conditions and/or
defects that cause the building or structure or portion thereof to be a
nuisance and shall state that the work to eliminate such conditions and/or
defects shall commence within thirty days and the work shall continue, either
to complete the specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove
the building or structure or portion thereof within sixty days from the date of
the service of the notice as provided in Section
1311.03. However, if any additional time is needed to complete the work, the
Building Inspectors may, at their discretion, issue a written permit
authorizing any additional time for the completion of any work herein. Further
the owner or owners shall leave the premises in a clean, safe and sanitary
condition being subject to the inspection and approval of the Building
Inspectors. In cases of an emergency making immediate repairs necessary, the
Building Inspectors may order the changes or demolition to be made within a
shorter period of time. In case of emergency the notice shall require the
building or structure or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith by the
occupants, if any.
(Ord. 187-9. Passed 8-21-95.)

left with the person, if any, in possession of the premises on which it is
alleged the public nuisance exists or, if there is no person in possession,
they shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the premises. The
Building Inspectors shall cause a return of service in the form of an affidavit
to be made by the person who served it, which affidavit shall set forth the

   (b)   Adequate plans and specifications, as required by the Building
Inspectors, covering such repairs or replacements shall be furnished by the
owner or owners to the Building Inspectors within fifteen days after receipt of

owners shall effect and complete such repairs and/or replacements. The Building
Inspectors may grant an extension of the special building permit if the owner

(Ord. 187-9. Passed 8-21-95.)
1311.05 ORDER FOR VACATION OF PREMISES; SERVICE OF NOTICE.
   Whenever the health authority of the City ascertains, from examination or
reports of its inspectors or sanitary officers or otherwise, that a public
nuisance exists as defined in Section
1311.01, in or upon any structure or building or portion thereof, and is of the
opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate
vacation of the premises or such portion thereof, and serves notice upon the
owner of such house, or his lessee or agent, or the person in possession,
charge or control thereof directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the
unclean or unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by
the authority and specified in the notice, the owner, agent or person shall
abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever this abatement does not take
place within such time, or whenever in the opinion of the authority such
abatement is impossible or impracticable without an immediate vacation of such
building or structure or portion thereof, and such notices, either for
abatement of the nuisance or of vacation of the premises, are served upon the
tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the duty of such tenant or other
occupant to comply with the terms of such notices and to abate the nuisance or
vacate the premises accordingly. After any such notice or order of vacation, no
person shall occupy or permit the occupancy of such premises or portion thereof
until the nuisance has been completely abated and such building or structure or
portion thereof has been rendered clean and sanitary in accordance with the
terms of the notice by the health authority.

person so notified or ordered may appear for a hearing before the health
authority, or other officer issuing same, to show cause why such order or
notice of vacation should not be issued, and unless the health authority, the
inspector or other officer is present at its or his office at the time so
specified, which time shall be not less than twenty-four hours after the
service of the notice or order.
   (b)   When the notice or order of vacation is issued as provided in Section

specifies a time, not less than five days after the service thereof, when the
person so notified or ordered may appear for a hearing before the health
authority, the Inspectors or other officer issuing same to show cause why such
notice or order should not be enforced. Provided, however, if an emergency
exists which requires, for the protection of the health of occupants, the
vacation of the building or structure or portion thereof without a delay of
five days, then no such fixing of a time for a hearing shall be required. (Ord.
187-9. Passed 8-21-95.)

1311.01(a), exists. The hearing shall be held within ten days following receipt
of such written demand and at least two days' notice in writing of the hearing
shall be given to the owner or owners. Such hearing shall be conducted by the

1323.01 FLOOD HAZARD REVIEW.
   (a)   The Mayor’s office, or the Zoning Inspector, when same is appointed,
shall review all applications for zoning permits for new construction and
substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding. Such review shall include all matters under the
jurisdiction of the Zoning Ordinance which are located in the flood hazard
area. If a prepared building site is in a location that has a flood hazard, any
proposed new construction or substantial improvement must:
      (1)   Be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure;
      (2)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage; and
      (3)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damages.

   (c)   The Mayor’s Office, or Zoning Inspector when duly appointed, shall
require new or replacement water supply systems and sanitary sewage systems to
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system and discharge from the system into flood water, and require on-site
waste disposal systems to be located so as to impairment of them or
contamination from them during flooding.
   (d)   The zoning permit form now used by the City shall be amended to
include a statement which indicates that the permit is to be issued for land
located or not located in the flood hazard area. The Mayor shall adopt a form
to be used for all zoning permits, or other reviews issued for improvements,
construction and alterations made in the flood hazard area as designated by the
map attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. Such form is to be
used to certify that requirements of this chapter have been met.

hazards, adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement
provisions consistent with the criteria set forth in Section 1910 of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations;
   (b)   Vests the Mayor’s Office, or the Zoning Inspector, when same is
appointed, with the responsibility, authority and means to:
      (1)   Delineate or assist the Administrator, at his request, in
delineating the limits of the areas having special flood hazards on available
local maps of sufficient scale to identify the location of building sites;
      (2)   Provide such information as the Administrator may request
concerning present uses and occupancy of the flood plain;
      (3)   Cooperate with Federal, State and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map and identify flood plain or mudslide
areas, and cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to management of
adjoining flood plain and/or mudslide areas in order to prevent aggravation of
existing hazards; and
      (4)   Submit on the anniversary date of the community’s initial
eligibility an annual report to the Administrator on the progress made during
the past year within the community in the development and implementation of
flood plain management measures;
   (c)   Appoints the Mayor’s Office, or the Zoning Inspector, when same is
appointed, to maintain for public inspection and to furnish upon request a
record of elevations in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures located in
the special flood hazard areas. If the lowest floor is below grade on one or
more sides, the elevation of the floor immediately above must also be recorded;
and

1327.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District established by City
Council, the Design Review Board shall review any proposed alterations or
changes to property as herein defined. The Board's approval of such alteration
or change shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work
thereon. In reviewing proposed alterations or changes to property, the Design
Review Board shall use as evaluative criteria the ten federal standards
established by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance shall be recognized
and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.
      (Ord. 146-9. Passed 10-17-94.)
1327.05 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS, CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any structure
of significant exterior architectural feature thereof in any designated
Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness from the Design Review Board for the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any area, place, site, building,
structure, object, or work of art within a designated Preservation District
unless the application for such permit is approved by Design Review Board
through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in the manner
prescribed herein.
(Ord. 117-13. Passed 8-16-21.)
1327.06 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District intends to
construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any portion of a structure within the
District, he shall first apply for and secure a Certificate of Appropriateness
from the Design Review Board. The application for a Certificate shall be
deposited with the City's Zoning Officer, together with such plans,
specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board may from time to
time prescribe. The Zoning Officer shall immediately transmit such Application
to the Secretary of the Downtown Review Board.
   (b)   Within thirty (30) days of filing, the Board shall consider the
applications, plans and specifications, and determine whether any "exterior
architectural feature" is involved and whether a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be issued or denied. If the Design Review Board determines that no
architectural feature is involved, it shall cause the secretary to endorse the
Certificate of Appropriateness and return the application, plans and
specifications to the applicant. If the Board fails to act on an application
within thirty (30) days of filing, the application shall be deemed approved.
   (c)   In the event that the Design Review Board finds that an architectural
feature is involved, the Board shall determine whether the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition is appropriate or
whether it has an adverse effect upon the purposes of this chapter or the
Preservation District. In making such determination, the Board shall refer to
the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as quoted herein.
In the case of archeological properties, the Board shall refer to the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation's Treatment of Archeological Properties: A
Handbook.
   (d)   The Board may require any person applying for a Certificate of
Appropriateness or request any person whose interests appear adverse to those
of the applicant, to file with the Board prior to any hearing or determination,
information concerning the applicant's intentions, or such adverse person's
interests or intentions.
   (e)   If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition
is determined to have no adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does
not violate the spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board
secretary shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (f)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect on the
Preservation District, and does violate the spirit and purposes of these
regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of the Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (g)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the thirty
(30) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Zoning Department of such determination
and transmit to him a certified copy of the reasons for denial and
recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (h)   Upon denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall, impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both. The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within
thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is
accepted by both parties, the Board may henceforth issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (i)   In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meetings shall be held at least every forty-five (45) days after the initial
meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of
this Chapter, then and in such event, the secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed demolition.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative property use is developed or no offer to
save the structure is made by the applicant, the Board or a third party, then
the applicant may appeal the decision to City Council. City Council may affirm
or reverse the Board decision. If City Council affirms the decision, the denial
of Certificate of Appropriateness will stand.
   (j)   In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
construction, reconstruction, or alteration:
      (1)   The Board and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find an alternative
to incompatible new construction, reconstruction, or alteration within a
Preservation District. If the Board and applicant do not agree on an
alternative solution at the initial meeting, then they must continue to
undertake meaningful discussion for the purpose of seeking a compromise
solution, and such good faith meetings shall be held at least every forty-five
(45) days after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith in the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of
this Chapter, then and in such event, the secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction,
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision to City Council. City Council may affirm or reverse the Board
decision. If Council affirms the decision, the denial of Certificate of
Appropriateness will stand.
(Ord. 146-9. Passed 10-17-94.)
1327.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this Chapter or the application thereof is held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
Chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application
and to this end the provisions of this Chapter are hereby declared severable.
(Ord. 146-9. Passed 10-17-94.)
1327.08 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
