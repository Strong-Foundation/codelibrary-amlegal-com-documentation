EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

Passed 9-1-20.)
111.11 ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Every proposed ordinance and resolution shall be read first for information
on the day when introduced, which shall constitute the first reading of such
ordinance or resolution. The same shall be taken up at a subsequent meeting of
Council, when it shall be read a second time and may be amended. When amended,
it must be referred again to the committee, who will report it back to Council
in its amended form, and it shall again have a first reading. Unless otherwise
ordered by Council, it shall then lie on the table until subsequent meetings
for its second and third readings before its final passage or adoption. No
amendment shall be received for discussion at the third reading of any
ordinance or resolution, but it shall be in order at any time before final
passage or adoption to move to refer an ordinance or resolution to a committee
for amendment. Any ordinance or resolution so referred shall, when reported
back to such committee, be put on its first reading as hereinbefore set forth.
However, under suspension of the proper rule, an ordinance or resolution may be
put on its final passage or adoption at one meeting of Council. The practice of
the suspension of the rules to expedite the passage or adoption of ordinances
and resolutions shall not be abused, and other than emergency ordinances and
resolutions shall not be disposed of at one meeting of Council unless a real
advantage in so doing is shown to exist.

you removed from this meeting site, and if deemed necessary by the Sergeant-at-

calendar days after the written disconnect order is mailed or otherwise

false alarms; or
      (2)   If the disconnect order was based on failure to pay assessments
when due and all delinquent false alarm fees have been paid in full; or

was generated by their system.

mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise. Whenever “person” is

associations shall mean the owners or part-owners thereof, and as applied to
corporations, the officers thereof.
   (d)   “Rent” means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits

prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the
Treasurer, shall become final and conclusive, and immediately due and payable.
If an application is made, the Treasurer shall give not less than five days’
written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at
a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should
not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties
should not be so fixed. After the hearing the Treasurer shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written notice to the person in the

against all qualifying wages earned or accruing on or after that date.
   The Ordinance remains in effect until further legislative change but in no
way affects tax rates stated in any prior ordinance, resolution or tax
legislation ongoing or of limited duration in effect prior to January 1, 2004.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX - RESIDENT EMPLOYEES.
   In the case of residents of the City of Bucyrus, an annual tax of one (1)
percent is imposed on all qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and
other taxable income earned or accrued on or after January 1, 2004. There is
also imposed on these same earnings any additional amount of tax of limited
duration imposed by any prior ordinance or resolution for whatever time period
is stated in that ordinance or resolution. For the purpose of determining the
tax on the earnings of resident taxpayers, the source of the earnings and the
place or places in or at which the services were rendered are immaterial. The
tax, or taxes, shall be imposed on qualifying wages. All such earnings,
wherever earned or paid are taxable; however, if a taxpayer’s income includes
income against which the taxpayer has taken a deduction for Federal income tax
purposes for employee business expense, as reported on Form 2106, a deduction
in the same amount as shown on Form 2106 will be allowed for Bucyrus income tax
purposes. If the income against which this deduction is taken was taxed by
another municipality, credit for the tax paid to that city will be reduced in
accordance with the said deduction.
   The following are items which are subject to the tax:
   (a)   Qualifying wages and other compensation received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for
services rendered on and after January 1, 2004.
      (1)   As an officer, director or employee of a corporation (including
charitable and other non-profit corporations), joint stock association or joint
stock company;
      (2)   As an employee (as distinguished from a partner or member)of a
partnership, limited partnership, or any other form of unincorporated
enterprise owned by one or more persons;
      (3)   As an employee (as distinguished from the proprietor) of a
business, trade or profession conducted by an individual owner;
      (4)   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
State of Ohio or any of the political subdivisions thereof;
      (5)   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
United States Government or of a corporation created and owned, or controlled
by the United States Government or any of its agencies;
      (6)   As an employee of any other entity or person.
   (b)   Qualifying wages and other compensation received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for
services rendered on and after January 1, 2004.

corporations), governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, department, division, subdivision, section or unit, or any other
entity.
   (c)   Commissions received by a taxpayer whether directly or through an
agent and whether in cash or in property, for services rendered on and after
January 1, 2004 regardless of how computed, by whom or wheresoever paid.
If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the commissions earned, the tax
is paid on the gross amount received.
Amounts received from an employer by way of employee business expense and not
by way of compensation and used as such by the individual receiving them, are
not deemed to be compensation, whether or not the employer deducts these
amounts as an expense in determining his net profits.
      If such commissions are included in the net earning of a trade, business,
profession, enterprise or activity carried on by such individual and therefore
subject to tax under Section
185.02(c), they shall not again be separately taxed. In such case, such net
earnings shall be taxed as provided in Section
187.11.
   (d)   The receipt of fees and other compensation for personal services
rendered shall be deemed to be subject to tax under the Ordinance.
   (e)   Domestic servants are subject to tax under the Ordinance, but are not
subject to withholding provisions. That is to say, the Domestic will report
earnings and pay the tax directly to the Bucyrus Income Tax Department.
   (f)   Other compensation includes but is not limited to qualifying wages
paid by the employer for the purpose of health, rest, recuperation or other
rewards, regardless of label as sick pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, personal
days, severance pay, annual leave, longevity, bonuses, or wage continuation
plans.
   (g)   If a taxpayer has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and does
not receive said compensation as a result of the following, a refundable credit
will be allowed as provided in Section 718.021 of the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.04 IMPOSITION OF TAX - NON-RESIDENT EMPLOYEES.
   In the case of individuals who are non-residents of Bucyrus, there is
imposed an annual tax of one (1) percent, plus any additional tax of limited
duration imposed by the Ordinance or Resolution, already in effect at this
time, on all qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other
taxable income, earned or accruing on or after January 1, 2004 for work done or
services performed or rendered within the City of Bucyrus, whether such
remuneration or compensation is received or earned directly or through an agent
and whether paid in cash, property, or services. This section should not be
construed as levying a tax on income that is exempted under Section
187.31(a)(11).
   The items subject to tax under this Section are the same as those listed and
defined in Section
187.03. For methods of computing the extent of such work or services performed
within the City of Bucyrus, and cases involving compensation partly within and
partly outside of the City of Bucyrus, see Section
187.15.

percent plus any additional tax of limited duration imposed on income, whether
by the Ordinance or Resolution, already in effect on profits earned or accruing
on or after January 1, 2004.
   (b)   For the purpose of construing subsection (c) and (d) of Section
185.02, the term, "residents" in the phrase "conducted by residents of the City
of Bucyrus", will ordinarily be construed to have reference to the business
entity itself, as distinguished from the partners, proprietors or other
participants in its profits.
   (c)   Generally, a partnership, association or other unincorporated
enterprise owned by two or more persons will be taxed as an entity. However, in
the case of a non-resident partnership, association or unincorporated
enterprise which cannot be reached or taxed directly by the City of Bucyrus, or
if only part of its earnings may be directly taxed, then in either such case,
resident partners, co-owners, proprietors or other participants in the profits
thereof must include in their declaration and tax return or returns their
distributive shares of such profits, or portion thereof not taxed to the
business enterprise as an entity, and must pay the tax thereon. If such
earnings were taxable by another municipality in this State, credit for taxes
paid to said municipality will be granted. The amount of the credit shall equal
the lesser of the following amounts, subject to Section
185.04.
      (1)   The amount, if any, of tax paid by the partnership, association or
other unincorporated enterprise to another municipality in this state,
apportioned ratably according to the ownership interest of the taxpayer in
proportion to the ownership interest of all owners of the entity.
      (2)   The amount of tax that would be imposed on the partnership,
association or other unincorporated enterprise by the City if the said entity
conducted business in Bucyrus, apportioned ratably according to the interest of
the taxpayer in proportion to the ownership interest of all owners of the
entity.
   (d)   The tax imposed under Section
185.02(c) of the Ordinance is levied upon the entire net profits of the
resident trade, business, profession, other activity, enterprise, or
undertaking, wherever earned, paid or accrued and regardless of the fact that
any part of such business or professional activity may have been conducted at
or through a place or places of business located outside the City of Bucyrus.
Credit will be given for city income taxes paid to other municipalities as
prescribed under Section
185.04 of the Ordinance.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.06 NET BUSINESS PROFITS - NON-RESIDENTS.
   (a)   In the case of a non-resident individual, partnership, association,
fiduciary, or other entity (other than a corporation) engaged in the conduct,
operation, or prosecution of any trade, business, enterprise, undertaking or
other activity, there is imposed an annual tax of one (1) percent plus any
additional tax imposed by Ordinance or Resolution of limited duration, on the
net profits of such trade, business, profession, enterprise, undertaking or
other activity if, and to the extent, conducted in or derived from activity in
the City of Bucyrus.
   (b)   A non-resident entity within the meaning of subsection (e) of Section
185.02 of the Ordinance which has a branch or branches, office or offices, and/
or store or stores, warehouse, or other place or places in which the entity's
business is transacted, located in the City of Bucyrus, shall be considered to
be conducting, operating, prosecuting, or carrying on a trade, business,
profession, enterprise, undertaking or other activity to the full extent of the
sum total of all transactions originating or consummated in, by or through such
Bucyrus branch, office, store, warehouse or other place of business, including:
      (1)   Billings made on such transactions, or
      (2)   Services rendered, or
      (3)   Shipments made, or
      (4)   Goods, chattels, merchandise, etc., sold or
      (5)   Commissions, fees or other remuneration or payments earned.
   (c)   In the case of the partnership, association, or other unincorporated
business owned by one or more persons the tax, generally, shall be upon said
partnership, association, or business enterprise as an entity and not
ordinarily upon the partners or members thereof. However, the provisions of
Section
187.05 are applicable to render taxable against such resident partners or
members their distributive share of any profits of such non-resident entity not
taxable under the Ordinance.
 
   (d)   In determining the proportion or amount of the taxable net profits of
a non-resident business entity having a place or places of business within and
outside the City of Bucyrus, the net profits taxable to the City of Bucyrus
shall be determined using the Business Apportionment Percentage Formula
explained in Section
187.08.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.07 NET BUSINESS PROFITS - CORPORATION.
   (a)   In the case of a corporation doing business in Bucyrus, whether
domestic or foreign, whether in production, sales, service, or any facet of
corporate business, and whether domiciled in Bucyrus or elsewhere, there is
imposed an annual tax of one (1) percent, plus any additional tax of limited
duration imposed by any prior ordinance or resolution for whatever time period
is stated in that ordinance or resolution, on net profits earned or accruing on
or after January 1, 2004 of such corporation as a result of work done or
service performed or rendered, and business activities conducted in the City of
Bucyrus.
   (b)   The Provisions of Section
187.06(b) are applicable to such corporations.
 
   (c)   A corporation doing business both within and outside the City of
Bucyrus shall determine the Bucyrus net profits using the Business
Apportionment Percentage Formula explained in Section
187.08. (Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.08 BUSINESS APPORTIONMENT PERCENTAGE FORMULA.
   (a)   This section does not apply to taxpayers that are subject to and
required to file reports under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised Code. Net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the City
of Bucyrus shall be considered as having taxable situs in Bucyrus for purposes
of the Bucyrus Income Tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of the
following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in Bucyrus
during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the real and
tangible personal property owned and used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rent thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in Bucyrus to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed, excluding compensation described in Section
187.31(a)(11).
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in Bucyrus to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   (b)   As used in the preceding paragraph “sales made in Bucyrus” mean:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within Bucyrus
regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of goods
within Bucyrus;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within Bucyrus
regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point outside
Bucyrus if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the
solicitation or promotion of sales within Bucyrus and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place in
Bucyrus to purchasers outside such municipal corporation regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   If one of the factors (property, sales, or payrolls) is missing, the
other two (2) percentages are added and the sum is divided by two (2), and if
two (2) of the factors are missing, the remaining percentage is the business
apportionment percentage.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned entirely in or
outside the City of Bucyrus.
   
EXAMPLE 1:
Corporation having places of business in Bucyrus, Detroit and Cleveland.
Bucyrus real and tangible personal property $10,000. All real and personal
property (Bucyrus, Detroit and Cleveland) $100,000. Percentage: 10%.
Bucyrus sales $15,000. All sales $75,000. Percentage: 20%.
Bucyrus payroll $6,000. All payroll $20,000. Percentage: 30%.
Business Apportionment Percentage:
10% plus 20% plus 30% divided by 3 = 20%.
EXAMPLE 2:
Same corporation owning no real or tangible personal
property anywhere. Bucyrus sales $15,000. All sales $75,000.
Percentage: 20%.
Bucyrus payroll $6,000. All payroll $20,000. Percentage 30%
Business Apportionment Percentage:
20% plus 30% divided by 2 = 25%.
EXAMPLE 3.
Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in Bucyrus valued
at $10,000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside Bucyrus.
Other factors same as in Examples 1 and 2.
Business Apportionment Percentage:
100% plus 20% plus 30% divided by 3 = 50%.
   After determining such business apportionment percentage, the tax shall be
determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of the
taxpayer, wherever derived (thus arriving at the taxable net profit), and
computing one (1) percent plus any additional tax of limited duration imposed
by Ordinance or Resolution of the resultant taxable net profit.
Generally, the Business Apportionment Percentage Formula will result in a fair
apportionment of the taxpayer's net profits within and without the City of
Bucyrus. However, due to the peculiar circumstances of certain businesses, the
formula may result in an overstatement of earnings and tax in some cases or
result in a tax evasion in others, thus does not do justice to the taxpayer or
the City of Bucyrus. Accordingly, in such cases, the City Income Tax
Administrator may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and
proper apportionment in any case where the taxpayer has used the Business
Apportionment Percentage Formula.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)

187.10 FISCAL YEARS.
   Where the fiscal year of trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking and/or other activity differs from the calendar year the tax shall
be applicable to the net profits of the fiscal year. Any rate change in
subsequent fiscal years would be taxed on appropriate records or if it is not
possible, prorated. A fiscal year will only be recognized if it has been
approved by the Internal Revenue Service, and a short year will be considered a
full tax year.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.11 NET BUSINESS PROFITS.

for a taxpayer other than an individual shall be based on “adjusted federal
taxable income” as defined herein.

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code adjusted as follows:

and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the income and gain
directly relate to the sale, exchange or other disposition of an asset
described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         E.   Subsection (a)(1)D. hereof does not apply to the extent the
income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         F.   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
         G.   In the case of a real estate investment trust and regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions

      (2)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation and is not an individual,
the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal income as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation except:
         A.   Guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to
a partner, former partner, member or former member shall not be allowed as a
deductible expense; and
         B.   Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement
plan with respect to an owner or owner-employee of the taxpayer, amounts paid
or accrued to or for the health insurance for an owner or owner- employee, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for an owner or owner-employee
shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   (b)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2004, net profits
for a taxpayer who is an individual shall mean the individual’s profit required
to be reported on schedule C, schedule E, or schedule F.
      (1)   Rentals, as reported on schedule E, may aggregate profits and
losses for a net rental income but no net loss may be taken against other
income nor may it be carried either forward or backward.
      (2)   All other businesses may aggregate profits and losses of separate
businesses for a net business profit depending on if such profits and losses
are aggregated on schedule SE for federal income tax purposes, excluding the
profits or losses of resident partnerships, associations or other
unincorporated businesses taxed as entities as provided in Section
187.05(c) and the profits or losses of non-resident partnerships, associations
or other unincorporated businesses apportioned to Bucyrus.
      (3)   In no case may business losses or rental losses be taken against
wages or other compensation earned as an employee.
   (c)   All rentals of every description shall constitute a business or
profession regardless of the amount of gross rents or the form or compensation.

add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as allowing any
taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for the purposes of federal
self-employment tax.

187.12 STATUS OF LOSS CARRYOVER AND CARRYBACK IN INCOME TAX COMPUTATION.

may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.13 RECONCILIATION WITH FEDERAL RETURN.
   In a form satisfactory to the City Income Tax Administrator there shall be
submitted with each return filed by a taxpayer subject to the Federal Income
Tax, a reconciliation between the amount shown in the return filed with the
City Income Tax Administrator and the income reported to the Federal Internal
Revenue Service.
   If as a result of a change made in income by the Federal Internal Revenue
Service, or by a judicial decision, an additional amount will result as owing
to the City of Bucyrus, a report of such change shall be filed by the taxpayer
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the final notice of such change
from the Federal Authorities or after final decisions of a Court adjudicating
any such Federal Income Tax liability.
   If such decision or decisions result in a lessening of tax, a refund may be
applied for within a three (3) year period from the later of the filing date or
date of notice of reduction by authorities.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.14 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   On or before April 15th of each year, every taxpayer, eighteen (18)
years of age and older, subject to the provisions of Section
185.02(a) to (i) of the Ordinance shall, except hereinafter provided, make and
file with the City Income Tax Administrator a City tax return on a form
prescribed by and acceptable to the City Income Tax Administrator, whether or
not tax is due. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal
year or period.
      (1)   The annual withholding statement of an employer or employers,
showing the amount of tax deducted by said employer or employers from the
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other taxable income of a
nonresident employee, and paid by him or them to the City Income Tax
Administrator may be accepted as the return required of a nonresident employee
whose sole income, subject to tax under the Ordinance, is such qualifying
wages, commissions, other compensation and other taxable income.
      (2)   Any resident individual eighteen (18) years of age and older who is
permanently disabled or retired and has no income subject to the City Income
Tax may, with the approval of the City Income Tax Administrator, file a form
prescribed by the City Income Tax Administrator stating that he has no income
subject to the City Income Tax and state a return shall be filed upon any
change to his situation that would necessitate the filing of such a return.    
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for City purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable income
nor deductions included on the City return regardless of whether their federal
and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint City return is
made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income and the
liability with the respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the City Income Tax Administrator on a
form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon the request from the City Income
Tax Administrator, or on a generic form if the generic form, when completed and
filed, contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City’s
prescribed return and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic
form otherwise complies with all of the applicable provisions provided in the
Ordinance and herein.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations, who
are affiliated through stock ownership, if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant
to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless the
taxpayer files a written request to discontinue the filing of consolidated
returns and said request is approved by the City Income Tax Administrator.
   (e)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by the Ordinance and herein on such
earnings and profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of the
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the City
Income Tax Administrator may require.
   (f)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City Income Tax
Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request with the
City Income Tax Department. Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income
tax return may request an extension for filing a City Income Tax Return in
writing. The request for extension must be filed on or before the original due
date for the annual return. If the request is granted, the extended due date of
the City Income Tax Return shall be the last day of the month following the
month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The City Income Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for
extension if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a City Income Tax Return
does not extend the due date as provided in this chapter for the payment of the
tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period
of extension at the rate set out by Section
185.07 of the Ordinance. No penalty and interest shall be assessed in those
cases where either 90% of the tax due or 100% of the prior tax year’s liability
has been paid on or by the original due date.
   (g)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the City Income Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as
due. However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due, which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
187.15; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax, which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
187.19; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
185.04 of the Ordinance for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the provisions contained in Section
187.22 if a proper refund is called for on a City Income Tax Return, it shall
be paid within ninety (90) days of the filing date of the return or its due
date, whichever is later, or interest at the “going rate” will be paid on said
refund.
      (3)   As to the matter of final amounts due or overpaid, any amount under
$2.01 need not be remitted if owed, nor will these amounts be refunded or
credited if overpaid.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
these Rules and Regulations. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have
fifteen (15) days after notification by the City Income Tax Administrator or
duly authorized representative, to file the items provided by this paragraph.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.15 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer within, or doing business within, the
City who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other
compensation basis to deduct when such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside, the tax of one (1)
percent plus any additional tax of limited duration imposed by ordinance or
resolution of the qualifying wages due by such employer to such employee. The
tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
      (1)   All qualifying wages paid to employees who are non-residents of the
City of Bucyrus for services rendered, work performed, or other activities
engaged in to earn such qualifying wages within the City of Bucyrus; and
      (2)   All qualifying wages paid to employees who are residents of the
City of Bucyrus, regardless of the place where the services are rendered,
unless said services are rendered in another municipality levying a tax and the
employer is required to withhold tax from said wages for that municipality. In
which case, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Bucyrus
for only the difference, if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing
municipality and the tax imposed by the Ordinance on said qualifying wages.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock has been issued.
   (c)    The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received. The failure of an employer to remit to the City the tax
withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee
colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
   (d)   Commissions and fees paid to professional persons, brokers, and others
who are independent contractors and not employees of the payor, are not subject
to withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in
all instances file returns and pay tax pursuant to the provisions of Section
185.02 of the Ordinance. (See Sections
187.05 and
187.06).
   (e)   Where a non-resident employee receives compensation for personal
services rendered or performed partly within and partly without the City of
Bucyrus, the withholding employer shall withhold and remit from that portion of
the compensation which was earned within the City of Bucyrus, in accordance
with the following rules of apportionment, income tax of one (1) percent plus
any additional tax of limited duration imposed by ordinance or resolution of
said compensation:
      (1)   If the non-resident is a salesperson, agent, or other employee
whose compensation on the basis of commission depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by said non-resident, the deducting and withholding shall
attach to the portion of the entire compensation which the value of business
transacted by said non-resident within the City of Bucyrus bears to the total
volume of business transacted by said non-resident within and outside the City
of Bucyrus.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the City of Bucyrus bears to the total
number of working days employed within and outside the City of Bucyrus.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the City of Bucyrus of a non-resident
employee who performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the
City of Bucyrus, but enters the City for the purpose of reporting, receiving
instructions, accounting, etc., incidental to his duties outside the City shall
not be deemed to take such employee out of the class of those rendered their
services entirely outside the City of Bucyrus.
   (f)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise - but see subsection (g) below) where such advances are in
excess of commissions earned.
   (g)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided, that such expense must be of the kind and in the amount
recognized as deductible for Federal Income Tax purposes.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.16 RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   The deduction from salaries, wages and other compensation required to
be made by employers are to begin with compensation earned on and after January
1, 2004. The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deduction shall be made, filed and paid to the City Income Tax Administrator on
or before April 30, 2004.
   (b)   Each employer within the City of Bucyrus who employs one or more
persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other compensation basis shall deduct
at the time of the payment of such salary, wage, commission, or other
compensation, the tax of one (1) percent plus any other tax of limited duration
imposed by ordinance or resolution of qualifying wages due by the said employer
to the said employee and shall make a return and pay to the City Income Tax
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted as follows:
For the three (3) months ending March 31st, on or before April 30th;
For the three (3) months ending June 30th, on or before July 31st;
      For the three (3) months ending September 30th, on or before October
31st;
For the three (3) months ending December 31st, on or before the following
January 31st;
   The reporting periods referred to in the preceding paragraphs are elastic to
this extent: The employer will use the same quarterly accounting period for
reporting taxes withheld under the City of Bucyrus Income Tax Ordinance as he
uses in reporting quarterly taxes withheld to the Federal Government.
   (c)   Said return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtainable from the
City Income Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor by the City Income Tax Administrator.
   (d)   Commencing January 1, 2004, when the total amount of Bucyrus City
Income Tax deducted from salaries, wages and other compensation required to be
withheld by employers does not exceed $100.00 per month, or in those cases when
the account is a so-called “Courtesy” account where the employer is not
required by law to withhold from its employees, the return and payment of tax
withheld may be filed quarterly as prescribed above. If the total tax withheld
exceeds $100.00 per month, the employer must file the return and payment
monthly as prescribed in subsection (f) hereof.
   (e)   For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employers see
Section
187.22.
   (f)   Commencing January 1, 2004, when the total amount of Bucyrus City
Income Tax deducted from salaries, wages and other compensation required to be
withheld by employers exceeds $100.00 per month, a return and payment are
required to be filed on account of such deduction to the City Income Tax
Administrator on or before the last day of each following month in 2004, and
thereafter. (Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.17 LIMITATION ON CREDITOR FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the City of
Bucyrus, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall not
relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with these
Regulations respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes. (Res.
240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.18 STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the City of Bucyrus in
collecting and holding the tax required under the Ordinance to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds until
the same is paid to the City of Bucyrus.
   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source is
liable directly to the City of Bucyrus for the payment of such tax, whether
actually collected by such employer or not.
   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay
all such tax to the City in accordance with the provisions of Section
187.16. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the City in accordance with the provisions of Section
187.16, all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control
or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
filed or paid to the City as well as any related interest and penalties, and
are also liable under the provisions of Section
185.08 of the Ordinance. The dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an
officer’s, members, manager’s, employee’s or trustee’s liability for a failure
of the corporation, limited liability company or business trust to file returns
or pay said taxes. (Res. 240- 2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.19 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   An employee whose entire wages, salaries, or other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
187.15, whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his entire earnings for
such year by his employer, and who during such taxable year expects to derive
no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax under the
Ordinance, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
   (b)   All other taxpayers (as defined in the Ordinance and in these
Regulations) subject to the taxes imposed in Section
185.02 of the Ordinance, and every taxpayer who anticipates any income or net
profits not subject to total withholding as provided in the next preceding
paragraph, shall file with the City Income Tax Administrator a declaration of
his estimated tax as follows:
      (1)   On or before April 30th, 2004 every such calendar year taxpayer
shall file a declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable period beginning
January 1, 2004 and ending December 31, 2004.
      (2)   On or before April 15, 2005 every such calendar year taxpayer shall
file a declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable period beginning
January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2005.
      (3)   A similar declaration shall be filed by each such taxpayer on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of April each subsequent year during the life
of the Ordinance, as long as the conditions in subsection (b) hereof exist and
each declaration shall contain a statement of the taxpayer's estimated tax for
the full taxable year in which such declaration is filed.
   (c)   Taxpayers who, or which are permitted, pursuant to provisions of
Section
187.10, to file a return and pay their tax on a fiscal year basis shall file
their first declaration within four (4) months after the beginning of the first
fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2004. The declaration shall set
forth the taxpayer’s estimated tax for the full taxable year in which the
declaration is filed.
      (1)   For fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a
declaration shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth
(4th) month following the start of each fiscal year or period.
      (2)   Such taxpayers shall make quarterly payments as prescribed in
Section
187.20.
   (d)   The estimated tax for a calendar year taxpayer may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration or in equal installments as prescribed under
Section
187.20.
   (e)   The declaration so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the City Income Tax Administrator. In lieu of said form, a
generic form may be used provided it contains all of the information required
by the City Income Tax Administrator and the preparer of said form complies
with all of the applicable provisions provided herein. Any taxpayer who has
filed an estimate for Federal Income Tax purposes may, in making the
declaration, required hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein
contained are the same figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration
of his estimate for the Federal Income Tax. However, in addition to such
statement, any such taxpayer may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such
declared income so as to exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax
under the Ordinance.
   (f)   Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with Section
187.20. (Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.20 PAYMENT OF TAX INSTALLMENTS.
   (a)   At the time of filing each declaration (required by Section
 187.19) each taxpayer who is an individual shall pay to the Income Tax
Administrator twenty-two and one-half per cent (22.5%) of his estimated tax
liability for the current year. Thereafter, on or before the 31st day of July,
October and January, such taxpayer shall pay at least a similar amount.
However, if any such taxpayer shall, on or before any such payment date, file
an amended declaration showing an increase or decrease of the estimated tax,
the installments then and thereafter due shall be increased or diminished (as
the case may be) in such a manner that ninety percent (90%) of the estimated
tax liability shall be paid on or before January 31st through the payment of
quarterly installments of equal amounts during the quarterly periods remaining
from and after the filing of said amended declaration.
   (b)   At the time of declaration (required by Section
187.19), each taxpayer who is not an individual shall pay to the Income Tax
Administrator twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability for the current year. Thereafter, on or before the 15th
day of June, September and December, such taxpayer shall pay at least a similar
amount. For taxpayers on a fiscal year, payments shall be made on or before the
15th day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year.
However, if any such taxpayer shall, on or before any such payment date, file
an amended declaration showing an increase or decrease of the estimated tax
liability, the installments then and thereafter due shall be increased or
diminished (as the case may be) in such a manner that ninety percent (90%) of
the estimated tax liability shall be paid on or before December 15th or the
15th day of the twelfth month through the payment of quarterly installments of
equal amounts during the quarterly periods remaining from and after the filing
of any such amended declaration.
   (c)   Penalty and/or interest will not be assessed for the late payment or
non-payment of estimated tax liability in either of the following
circumstances:
      (1)   The taxpayer is a resident individual who resides in Bucyrus but
was not domiciled in the City on the first day of January of the current
calendar year.
      (2)   The taxpayer has remitted, pursuant to subsections (a) or (b)
hereof, an amount at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
taxpayer’s tax liability for the preceding year, provided that the return for
the preceding year reflected a twelve-month period and the taxpayer filed a
return for the preceding year.
   (d)   For final returns and final adjustments of tax due, see Section
187.14.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.21 RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under the Ordinance are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns
whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes paid or payable upon earnings
or net profits, or both and such records are to be preserved to enable the City
Income Tax Administrator, or any agent or employee of the City Income Tax
Administrator, to verify the correctness of the returns filed. Such records
shall be preserved three (3) years from the due date or date of filing
whichever is later. Omission of twenty-five (25) percent of gross income,
fraud, or failure to file extends this to six (6) years.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.22 COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   If, as a result of investigation conducted by the City Income Tax
Administrator, a return is found to be incorrect, the City Income Tax
Administrator is authorized to assess and collect any underpayment of tax
withheld at the source or any underpayment of tax owing by any taxpayer with
respect to earnings or net profits or both: If no return has been filed and a
tax is found to be owed the tax actually owed may be assessed and collected
with or without the formality of obtaining a delinquent return from the
employer or taxpayer.
   If the tax assessed was erroneously paid or withheld to another municipality
and if at the time of assessment the period allowed for refund from said
municipality has expired, a non-refundable credit will be allowed. Said credit
shall be calculated under the provisions of Section
185.04 of the Ordinance.
   (b)   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
City Income Tax Administrator, or through the medium of the filing of a claim
or petition for refund or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the
following guidelines shall apply:
      (1)   The claim must be made within three years from the date on which
such payment was made or the return was due, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied with
all provisions of the Ordinance and has furnished all information required by
the City Income Tax Administrator.
      (3)   Overpayments will either be refunded or credited to the taxpayer’s
current year’s liability at his or her option. Where no election has been made
by the taxpayer, overpayments of any year’s taxes shall be applied as follows:
         A.   To taxes owed for any year in the order in which such taxes
become due.
         B.   In the case of a business, any refund or credit may be applied to
an outstanding balance in the corresponding withholding account.
         C.   To his or her account in the form of a credit in the current tax
year.
      (4)   Credits of less than $2.01 will not be allowed and refunds of less
than $2.01 will not be paid.
   (e)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he may fail to withhold it from
the employee. If too much has been withheld, the excess shall be refunded by
the employer to the employee. The withholding agent (employer) will be expected
to maintain complete records of such adjustments with the employees and explain
the details of such adjustments in the withholding return either by schedule or
statement. A refund of over-withheld tax may be paid directly to the employee
provided the employer submits a statement to the City Income Tax Administrator
detailing the circumstances involving said overpayment and relinquishing the
right to have said funds directly refunded to them.
   (f)   In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer from
an employee and remitted to the City Income Tax Administrator, and there has
been a termination of the employee-employer relationship, the taxpayer
(employee) may obtain an adjustment by application to the City Income Tax
Administrator.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.23 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   All taxes imposed by the Ordinance remaining unpaid when the same have
become due, together with all interest and penalties thereon, become a debt due
the City of Bucyrus from the taxpayer, and are recoverable as other debts by
suit instituted by the City Income Tax Administrator, said Administrator’s
representative, or City Prosecutor.
   Employers who or which, although obliged under the Ordinance to withhold and
remit to the City Income Tax Administrator, the taxes required to be withheld
at the source (Section 187.15) shall if they fail to withhold and remit become
liable to the City of Bucyrus in a civil action to enforce the payment of the
debt created by such failure.
   When a final return is filed as described in Section
187.14 and a deficiency is determined to be due the City of Bucyrus, action to
collect the same must be brought within three (3) years after the tax was due
or the return filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud, failure
to file or the omission of twenty-five (25) percent or more of income required
to be reported and taxed prosecution may be commenced within six (6) years of
the later of commission of the offense, due date of return or date return was
filed.
   If any of the above circumstances occur and are discovered by the Federal
Internal Revenue Service or any other tax administering authorities, taxpayers
are required to notify the City Income Tax Administrator within 30 days and
satisfy the City of Bucyrus claim on such discovery.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.24 IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   Agents and employees charged with the duty of inspection or auditing of
records of employers and taxpayers will carry proper identification, which
shall be subject to examination by any person whose records are sought to be
examined.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.25 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter is inapplicable to any person or corporation upon whom or which
it is beyond the legal power of Council to impose the tax; it is likewise
inapplicable as to any property, income or profits (or part thereof) as to
which it is beyond the legal power of Council to levy the tax. (Res. 240-2003.
Passed 12-30-03.)
187.26 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein, is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such sentence, clause, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections, or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of the Council of the City of Bucyrus that this
chapter would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
sentence, clause, section or part thereof not been included herein. (Res. 240-
2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.27 SPLIT PAYROLLS.
   In the case of hourly employees where a pay period of one half (½) month or
less, encompasses two (2) different tax rate periods, said payroll shall be
considered a split payroll with the proper rate applied to each period’s
earnings. If the breakdown of said payroll would constitute an accounting
hardship on the employer, with the permission of the City Income Tax
Administrator, an equitable average rate of pro-rating of earnings, or any such
fair solution may be allowed.
   In the case of salaried employees paid on a calendar month, or less basis,
and said payroll encompasses two (2) different tax rate periods, said payroll
shall be considered a split payroll with the proper rate applied to each
period’s earnings. If the breakdown of said payroll would constitute an
accounting hardship on the employer, with the permission of the City Income Tax
Administrator, an equitable average rate of pro-rating of earnings shall be
allowed.
(Res. 240-2003. Passed 12-30-03.)
187.28 WITHHOLDING STATEMENTS.
   The Bucyrus Income Tax Department will require employers to file annual
employee earnings reports on forms similar to Federal Form W-2 or a substitute

municipal income taxes with quarterly withholding reports shall be filed with
the City Income Tax Administrator on or by February 28 of each year. A copy of
the wage and tax statement shall be furnished each employee by January 31.

corporations, or any other entity, located within or without the City of
Bucyrus, but doing business or any function of said business within the City of

deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.   .
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
189.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
189.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section 189.03 of this Chapter. To determine
whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
189.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    Intentionally left blank.

189.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
    (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino

      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose

agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and

whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)

189.061  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   “Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
189.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
189.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
189.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
189.062 of this Chapter.
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
189.03 (32) of this Chapter. (Ord. 43-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
189.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
189.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
189.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate

taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
189.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that

that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

189.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
189.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
189.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if

the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified

amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which

denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which

be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
189.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
189.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
189.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
189.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
189.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 46-2016. Passed 11-15-16.)
189.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-5.)
189.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section 189.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be

Section

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
189.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
189.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section 189.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

189.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
189.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H) Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 42-2015. Passed
12-1-15.)
189.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.134  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
189.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
189.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
189.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
189.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
189.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-15.)
189.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
189.15.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 42-2015. Passed 12-1-15.)
189.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
189.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
189.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
189.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
189.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
   (F)   Effective June 1, 2017, the City Tax Administrator may refer
collection of all Municipal Income Taxes, Fines, Penalties and Interest,
regardless of when the debt was incurred, to a debt collection entity. Any
Municipal Income Tax, Fines, Penalties or Interests referred to a collection
entity shall be immediately assessed a 33% collection fee upon referral to the
collection entity. If the collection entity is unable to collect the Municipal
Income Tax, Fines, Penalties and Interests, plus the collection fee, the Tax
Administrator at his/her discretion may then refer the matter for any other
civil or criminal prosecution as permitted under this chapter or Ordinance

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
transaction. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the
private property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   (b)   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)

the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right of way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle.
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;

   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section

continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules apply:
   (a)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
   (b)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for two-
way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
   (c)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting

directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the
roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that
portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
   (c)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such
vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as
to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane of
the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in that
lane.
   (d)   Markers, buttons or signs may be placed within or adjacent to
intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that
specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection,
and when such markers, buttons or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle
shall turn such vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required
by such markers, buttons or signs.
   (e)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

333.03 MAXIMUM SPEED LIMITS; ASSURED CLEAR DISTANCE AHEAD.
   (a)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle at a speed greater or less
than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and
width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall
drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of

same at a speed not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof. The end of every school zone may be marked by a
sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section or in the manual
and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §
3301-35-08, a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s
pupils certifying that the school meets state minimum standards for
nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to
the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;

County Engineer to create a school zone at the location of the school. Upon
receipt of such written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone
at that location by erecting appropriate signs;
            4.    Any preschool education program operated by an educational
service center that is located on a street or highway with a speed limit of
forty-five miles per hour or more, when the educational service center in
writing requests that the County Engineer create a school zone at the location
of that program. Upon receipt of such a written request, the County Engineer
shall create a school zone at that location by erecting the appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway. Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries. The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's
initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the
traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines,
except when those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A.
and C. hereof.

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;

bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

who has registered with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in accordance with
subsection (c)(5) of this section.
      (5)   A person who has received an affidavit under subsection (c)(3) of
this section stating that the person has a permanent or reasonably expected to
be permanent physical impairment that makes use of an occupant restraining
device impossible or impracticable may register with the Registrar attesting to
that fact. Upon such registration, the Registrar shall make that information
available in the law enforcement automated data system. A person included in
the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not required to have
the affidavit obtained in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section in
their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

or any portion thereof to be dropped or deposited upon any street, highway or
other public place to immediately remove the same or cause it to be removed.
339.09 SHIFTING LOAD; LOOSE LOADS.
   (a)   In addition to any other lawful requirements of load distribution, no

the vehicle to such an extent as to interfere with the safe operation of the
same.
 
   (b)   No motor vehicle or trailer shall be driven unless the tailboard or
tailgate, tarpaulins, chains (except ground or contact chains), ropes, stakes,
poles, and the like, or any part of the load, are securely fastened to prevent
dangling, flapping, swinging or falling from the side, end or top of the load

subsection (b)(1) hereof.
   (c)   This section does not apply to the use of tire chains when there is
snow or ice on the streets or highways where such chains are being used, or the
immediate vicinity thereof. (ORC 5589.081)
339.12 WEIGHING VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded. The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or State sealer with
the State standards or standards approved by the State and such scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to State standards or standards approved
by the State.
    At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determination.
   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable sealed
scale, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level,
or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle shall not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation in axles being weighed shall not exceed one-fourth inch
per foot of the distance between such axles. Whenever compact, self-contained,
portable sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways are used, the weights determined are not unlawful unless
they exceed by more than three percent the weight limitations set forth in Ohio
R. C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive.
   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact, self-
contained, portable sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less apart,
shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside
wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use of
compact, self-contained, portable sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   Whenever such officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R. C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, or, when compact, self-contained,
portable sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways, are used, to the limits permitted under Ohio R. C.
5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, plus two percent. (ORC 4513.33)

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

501.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in the Codified Ordinances, all terms shall have the meanings as set
forth under the Ohio Revised Code.
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00

Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to
this subsection (c).

505.07 ANIMAL BITES; RABIES.
   (a)    Every animal which bites a person shall be promptly reported to the

securely confined for clinical observation. After a laboratory confirmed case
of rabies has occurred within the last twelve months, such confinement shall be
for a period of at least twenty-one successive days at the owner's expense and
on the owner's premises under the supervision of the Animal Warden.
   (b)   Dogs having been vaccinated within three years with CEO (chick-embryo
rabies vaccine) or within one year with phenolized vaccine, may be confined on
the premises of the owner, isolated from all individuals other than the
immediate family. The animal must be examined by a practicing veterinarian on
the first and tenth days after the bite and a written report sent to the Animal
Warden. Confinement must also be on the premises of the owner as provided in
this subsection if there has been no laboratory confirmed case of rabies during
the past twelve months within the county.
   (c)   The owner, upon demand by the Animal Warden, shall forthwith surrender
any animal which has bitten a human being, or which is suspected of having been
exposed to rabies, for supervised confinement, the expense of which shall be
borne by the owner. Such animal may be reclaimed by the owner if it is adjudged
free of rabies upon payment of the actual costs incurred for such confinement.
   (d)   When rabies has been diagnosed in an animal confined for clinical
observation, when rabies is suspected by a practicing veterinarian, or if the
animal dies while under observation, the head of such animal shall be sent to
the Ohio State Health Department by the local health authorities for
pathological examination and the proper public health officer shall be notified
of reports of human contacts and the diagnosis.
   (e)   When a positive diagnosis of rabies has been made, the Animal Warden
shall recommend an area-wide quarantine for a period of ten days, during which
time all animals must be on a leash. All pets shall be under restraint of the
owner. During such quarantine, no animal may be taken or shipped away from the
Municipality without written permission of the Animal Warden. During this
quarantine period and as long afterward as he decides it is necessary to
prevent the spread of rabies, the Animal Warden may require that all dogs,
three months of age and older, shall be vaccinated against rabies by an
accredited veterinarian with a canine rabies vaccine approved by the Biologics
Control Section of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The types of approved
canine anti-rabies vaccine to be used and the recognized duration of immunity
for each shall be established by any qualified health officer or veterinarian.
All vaccinated dogs shall be restricted, by leashing or confinement on enclosed
premises for thirty days after vaccination. During the quarantine period the
health officer or veterinarian shall be empowered to provide for a program of
mass immunization by the establishment of temporary emergency canine rabies
vaccination clinics strategically located throughout the area of the health
jurisdiction.
   (f)   Dogs bitten by a known rabid animal shall be immediately destroyed. If
the owner is unwilling to destroy the exposed animal, strict isolation and

of at least ten days.

last twelve months in Crawford County, such confinement shall be at the City
Animal Shelter or, at the aninmal owner’s option and expense, in a veterinary
hospital of his/her choice.
      (2)   Dogs which have been vaccinated within three years with CEO or

animal must be examined by a practicing veterinarian on the first and tenth
days after the bite and a written report sent to the City Health Commissioner.
      (3)   Confinement may be on the premises of the animal owner as described

suspected of having been exposed to rabies shall, upon demand by the so-called

A written application shall be given to the Mayor, signed by a minor and by a
parent of such minor, if feasible, stating:
      (1)   The name, age and address of such minor;
      (2)   The name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof;
      (3)   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical
characteristics of such minor;
      (4)   The necessity which requires such minor be in or upon a public
place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; and
      (5)   The street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of
time involved by date and hour;
The Mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use by the minor of those
public places at such hours as in the Mayor’s opinion may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone, or other
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Mayor, or if unavailable, to the Police Chief.
   (h)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary
night-time activities of more minors that can be readily dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Mayor
permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of use of public places
permitted and the period of time involved, not to extend more than thirty
minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity.
   (i)   When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and place of employment and
his hours of employment. (Ord. 34-90. Passed 1-15-91.)

   (a)   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or by
inefficient control allow such minor to be in or upon any public place under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this portion of this chapter. “Knowingly” includes knowledge which a parent
should reasonably be expected to have concering the whereabouts of a minor in
that parent’s legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
   (b)   It shall be an affirmative defense to this section that such parent
within thirty days preceding the alleged violation filed, or caused to be
filed, a complaint against such minor under Ohio R.C. 2151.27.
(Ord. 34-90. Passed 1-15-91.)

cannot be returned to the seller in substantially as good condition as when
received by the buyer.
   (e)    If goods are to be returned to seller, the buyer shall tender
delivery thereof at the location where the seller made delivery to the buyer.

has afforded to the seller reasonable time and access to take possession.
   (f)    The right to cancel granted herein may not be waived by the parties

not want the goods or services, you may cancel this agreement by mailing or
delivering a written notice to the seller. This notice must say that you do not
want the goods or service and must be mailed, telegraphed or delivered before
midnight on the third calendar day after you sign this agreement. This notice
must be mailed, telegraphed or delivered to: (insert name and mailing address

sidewalk in front of their property, or in front or beside such real property
as the case may be, to permit the passage of pedestrian traffic.
(Ord. 2778. Passed 6-16-64.)
905.03 ASSESSMENT.
   If the sidewalks are not reconstructed or repaired within a period of not

assessed on all the property bounding or abutting thereon, as provided by Ohio
R.C. 729.01 et seq. (Ord. 8-2008. Passed 2-5-08.)
905.04 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   All sidewalks constructed in the City shall meet the following requirements:
   (a)    Location. Unless otherwise specified by resolution of necessity
enacted by Council pursuant to Ohio R.C. 719.01 et seq., or as otherwise
provided in the Bucyrus Codified Ordinances, the edge of the sidewalk closest
to the abutting property line shall be twelve inches from and parallel to the
property line. The subdivision developer or other person responsible for
installation of the sidewalk may request that the Planning Commission grant a
variance to the location of sidewalks within the subdivision or upon the
subject abutting property due to zoning requirements or unusual or unique
conditions within the subdivision or upon the subject abutting property. The
Planning Commission shall have discretion to move said sidewalk location
farther into the right of way toward the street and away from the abutting
property line. The developer or other person responsible for the installation
of the sidewalk shall have a right of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals on
any action taken by the Planning Commission regarding a variance requested
hereunder. This
      (Ord. 33-2006. Passed 12-19-06.)
   (b)    Width. All sidewalks constructed shall conform in width to the
sidewalks which have been constructed previously in the same block, but shall
not be narrower than four feet in width.
   (c)   Block Length. All sidewalks constructed shall be divided along their
length into blocks six feet long, except at closures where the block may be a
minimum of four feet long and a maximum of seven feet long.
   (d)    Thickness. All sidewalks constructed shall have a uniform thickness
of four inches for walks subjected to pedestrian traffic only, and six inches
for walks subjected to vehicular traffic.
   (e)    Grade and Slope. All sidewalks constructed shall be above and
parallel to the established top of curb grade of the street, and slope toward
the curb line of the street. The height that the sidewalk shall be above the
top of curb grade is determined as follows:
      (1)    All curb lawns shall slope up away from the curb at the rate of
one-half inch per foot from the curb to the walk.
      (2)    All sidewalks shall slope down toward the curb at the rate of one-
quarter inch per foot.
      (3)    At intersections the sidewalks shall blend with other walks and
curbs as directed by the Engineer.
   (f)   Subgrade. All sidewalks constructed shall be laid on a firm subgrade
uniformly graded so that the required thickness of sidewalk shall be obtained
over its entire surface.

earth, all loose dirt and organic matter shall be removed from the sidewalk
area before placing the concrete.
      (2)    Where the sidewalk is to be constructed on filled earth, the fill
shall be thoroughly compacted subsoil, free from roots and other organic
matter.
      (3)    No sidewalk or fill shall be placed until the sidewalk area has
been stripped of the topsoil.
   (g)    Drains. When new sidewalks are constructed or old sidewalks renewed
or relaid, all storm water drains now emptying onto the sidewalk area shall be
placed beneath the walk and drained into the gutter or to an available storm
sewer where possible.
   (h)    Forms. All sidewalks constructed shall be formed to the required line
and grade and slope by the use of either steel or wood forms properly secured
so that neither the placing of materials of construction nor the finishing of
the surface can disturb them horizontally or vertically.
    (i)    Material. Sidewalks constructed shall be constructed of concrete,
made with high quality ingredients in the approved manner and of the approved
proportions for such work. Other materials may be used only if approved by the
City Engineer and Service-Safety Director.
   (j)    Plans and Specifications. All sidewalks constructed shall be
constructed in conformity with the foregoing specifications and the plan (on
file in the Engineer's office) showing the details for sidewalk construction
and incorporated herein as if fully written and drawn herein, and together they
shall be the only guide for the construction of sidewalks. (Ord. 2778. Passed

thorn trees, catalpa or Callery pear and cultivars of Callery pear shall
henceforth be permitted to be planted upon any tree lawn in the City.
      (2)   Any silver maple, catalpa, poplar, basswood, box elder or willow
upon private property in the City in such close proximity to any public place
in the City as will permit the roots of the tree to penetrate through or under
the surface of any public place in the City, is declared to be a public
nuisance and shall be abated by the Service-Safety Director.
   (d)   Prohibited Manipulations of Plantings in or Adjacent to the Public
Way.
      (1)   Espaliers or topiary: Forms achieved through trimming or pruning
that are distorted or contrary to the natural shape of the species.
      (2)   Shrubs: Shrubs that typically grow taller than three feet, yet not
tall enough to be under trimmed to a height of six feet.
      (3)   Topped or dehorned trees: Trees with most of or the entire crown
removed.
   (e)   The plantings listed in subsections (a) through (d) above may be

Director's designee before a request for removal will be considered.
   (e)   A tree may be considered for removal if it is affecting other trees in
such a way that the growth needs to be thinned or if the branches are affecting
utility lines, is growing too close to a utility pole, or is growing too close
to another immovable obstruction (e.g., a flagpole).
   (f)   A tree that is a nuisance due to its natural state shall not serve as
the basis for removal, subject to the appeals procedure set forth in Section

   For the purposes of this chapter the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   Limited Access Street. A "limited access street" is a street
especially designed for through traffic, over which abutters have no easement
or right to access by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon such
street. Access may be allowed only after the approval of the legislative
authority granting such an easement.

   (a)   Pre-application Meeting.  The owner or owners of property wishing to
establish an easement onto a limited access street must first meet with the
City of Bucyrus Planning Commission or its designated representative prior to
submitting a formal request. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early
and informally the purpose and effect of these regulations, the criteria and
standards contained therein and to familiarize the owner or owners with the
comprehensive plan for the City.
   (b)   Pre-application Sketch Content. The owner or owners shall submit to
the Planning Commission a sketch plan, legibly drawn at a suitable scale and
containing the following:
      (1)    The size of the easement requested;
      (2)    The number of easements in the area, including distances from
requested easements;
      (3)    The expected amount of traffic on proposed easement;
      (4)    Name of owner or owners, address and phone number.
(Ord. 84-96. Passed 9-17-96.)
911.04 CRITERIA FAVORING APPROVAL BY BOARD.
   (a)   Combined driveway/street of various owners wishing to combine into one
easement;
   (b)   Proximity to another easement;
   (c)   Industrial/commercial property with corresponding greater use of the
easement by persons using this property;

   Once an application for an easement is established, the Planning Commission
must recommend approval or denial of the application. In the event of a denial,
the Planning Commission shall provide a written response to applicant to
explain its denial. Once the plan is submitted to the Planning Commission and
has been denied, an applicant can request a review of the decision by the
Platting Committee.
(Ord. 84-96. Passed 9-17-96.)
911.06 APPROVAL OF TRAFFIC COMMISSION.
   In the event of approval of the easement by the Planning Commission, the
applicant will submit his/her request to the Traffic Commission for their
recommendation. Once the Traffic Commission has made its recommendation the
matter will be submitted to the Platting Committee of City Council for final
determination and for decision of Council as a Whole.

914.01 EXTENSION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Water Line Extensions. The cost of water line extensions shall be paid
by the developer or individual requesting the water line, except where it is
determined by the City that extensions are essential to provide adequate water
circulation or fire protection, or are necessary to provide water service to
City property, or are necessary for potential expansion of City services.
   (b)   Larger Water Mains.
      (1)   When the City requires water mains larger than eight inches in
diameter to be constructed within the Municipality, the difference in the cost
of materials and the size of pipe over eight inches shall be paid by the City.
The difference in cost shall be determined by the City Engineer, based upon
project invoices and current City water works material invoices, as recorded in
the office of the Service-Safety Director.
      (2)   When the City requires water mains larger than the proposed project
requirements, based on assessments of potential future need, to be constructed
outside the corporate limits of the Municipality, the entire cost of the
extension shall be paid by the applicant-developer, except that the difference
in costs based on potential future City needs may be borne by the City.
   (c)   Extension of Water Lines. Water lines shall be extended the full
distance across the development, tract or lot that is to be serviced; i.e. to
farthest point of the lot line.
   (d)   Size of Water Line. The size of a water line shall be determined by
the City Engineer, based on requirements for the satisfactory servicing of
present and future areas to be serviced.
   (e)   Water Lines to Become City Property. All water lines after
installation, shall become the property of the City and all maintenance thereon
shall be the responsibility of the City.
   All connections thereto must have proper City approval. All property owners
shall be required to take out and pay for the necessary permits for making
connections to existing water lines.
   However, the City shall not issue permits for connections to properties for
which no owner has contributed to the cost of constructing the line to which
they are connecting until such owners have remunerated those who constructed or
had the line constructed in accordance with the following regulations:
      (1)   Within a period of ten years from date of construction, such
remuneration shall be paid to the person, persons or corporation responsible
for the initial construction of the water line.
      (2)   Such remuneration shall be based on one-half of the actual cost per
foot of the original construction of the water line; that is one-half per each
side of the street serviced. Payment shall be based on twelve inch diameter
pipes, or smaller.
      (3)   Evidence, in writing, must be furnished to the City that
satisfactory remuneration has been made before a permit shall be issued.
      (4)   In the event of a disagreement between the parties regarding the
amount of remuneration, the Engineering Office shall have the authority to
determine the amount of remuneration which must be paid before a permit shall
be issued.
      (5)   If the person or corporation responsible for the initial
installation of the water line is deceased, or if the corporation is dissolved,
their rights for remuneration shall cease to exist and shall not vest to their
heirs, successors and assigns.
      (6)   When the conditions or circumstances exist, as set forth in
subsection (e)(5) above, and when the ten year period has passed, the property
owner desiring to connect to water lines which he did not pay for shall be
required to remunerate the City at the rate of twelve dollars and fifty cents
($12.50) per front foot before a permit shall be issued.
      (7)   The remuneration as set forth in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(6)
hereof, shall apply as of the date of the water line extension.
   (f)   Costs. The entire cost of the installation and the cost of the fire
hydrant and materials, to be installed, shall be paid by the owner or developer
requesting the extension of any water line where a fire hydrant is required
according to the standards of the City, except where it is determined by the
City that water main or extensions are essential to provide adequate water
circulation or fire protection, or are necessary to provide water service to
City property, or are necessary for the potential expansion of City services.
   (g)   Extensions. Any extensions beyond the City limits must have the
approval of Council by means of the necessary and proper legislation before any
construction can be undertaken.
(Ord. 37-2017. Passed 8-2-17.)
914.02 CONNECTION CHARGE OTHER THAN BY ASSESSMENT.
   Where a connection is made into a water line, the cost of which is not paid

Charges to domestic users shall be billed and paid monthly. Charges to
commercial users shall likewise be billed and paid monthly. All bills provided
for herein shall be due and payable on the tenth day after the billing date.
Any bill not paid within ten days after it becomes due shall be subject to the
addition of a penalty charge of ten percent (10%) of the charges billed.
Billing shall be according to two cycles:
      (1)   Cycle One: Bills will issue on the fifteenth day of the month and
shall become due and payable on the twenty-fifth day of the month, and shall
incur the ten percent (10%) penalty if not paid within ten days of the due
date. If Cycle One bills are not paid by the tenth day of the following month,
the Service-Safety Director shall discontinue water service as of that date
until all unpaid water charges, both past due and currently due and owing for
such premises have been fully paid.
      (2)   Cycle Two: Bills will issue on the first day of the month and shall
become due and payable on the tenth day of the month, and shall incur the ten
percent (10%) penalty if not paid within ten days of the due date. If Cycle Two
bills are not paid by the twenty-fifth day of the month, the Service- Safety
Director shall discontinue water service as of that date until unpaid water
charges, both past due and currently due and owing for such premises have been
fully paid.
   Further, if water service is discontinued for non-payment under this section
for a unit in a multiple tenant unit building without separate outside shut-off
valves for each tenant unit, the Service-Safety Director shall cause notice to
be issued to the owner of the building to install individual outside shut-off
valves in accordance with subsection (c) hereof within thirty days from the
date of such notice. The Service-Safety Director shall include in such
notification to the owner of the building that failure to install individual
outside shut-off valves within said thirty day period shall be deemed an
election by the owner of the building to have a single billing for the
building’s public services to be billed directly to the owner. The Service-
Safety Director shall further notify the building owner in this notice that
failure to pay the charges as set forth in the single billing will result in
discontinuance of water service in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this subsection. Further, the Service-Safety Director shall issue copies of the
notice to the building owner as contemplated herein to all tenants of the
affected building.
(Ord. 29-2006. Passed 7-18-06.)

with a single billing directed to the building owner, on the one hand, or of
directing the installation of separate water/sewerage meters for each tenant’s
rented unit’s public service demands, with separate shut-off valves for each
meter installed outside of building, whether residential or commercial, within
a single building, with a direct billing to be sent to each individual tenant
for water/sewerage services provided to each. A separate domestic outside shut
off is required for any and all fire lines in order not to disrupt fire

whether located within or without the City, which has its own independent water
supply, but is connected at the same time to the City sewerage system.
   (e)   The minimum charge for water and sewerage service shall be based upon
the “going per rates table” for 200 cubic feet per meter, however, for all
family dwellings, both residential and commercial monthly rental units, each
with its own private bathroom or kitchen facilities, excluding common bathroom
used by more than one tenant, the monthly charge for water and sewerage service
shall be based, in accordance with the breakdown steps of the “going water
rates table” as if they were metered by one meter. This does not mean a minimum
rate charge per unit. (Ord. 32- 93. Passed 6-1-93.)
   (f)   In the event of a turn-off for nonpayment of a water bill, a
reconnection charge of not less than forty-five dollars ($45.00) shall be

imposed for services that are to be turned off for nonpayment of a bill and the
service employees are unable to shut off the service while there.
(Ord. 29-2006. Passed 7-18-06.)
   (g)   A multiple tenant building with one meter will not be entitled to the
volume usage discount established in the going water rates table until the

923.02 USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS; PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
   The discharge of nonacceptable industrial wastewater into the sewerage
system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater shall be
deemed nonacceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic substances in
the wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic or harmful
substances include those pollutants subject to the Clean Water Act and defined
in Section 307(a). Limits on toxic or harmful substances of this section are as
shown below:
 
Toxic or Harmful Substance Tolerable Limit
Barium                     4.91 mg/L
Cadmium                    0.04 mg/L
Chromium (total)           5.71 mg/L

   (Ord. 59-2008. Passed 12-16-08.)
 
   The preceding listing of allowable concentrations of toxic or harmful
substances is subject to revisions as required to meet current water quality
standards, effluent standards imposed by state or federal agencies, or the
requirements of Section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act. In special cases (low
volume users), the concentration of toxic or harmful substances in the
wastewater may be exceeded if it is determined by the City that the total
pounds of toxic or harmful substances discharged to the sewage system are not
harmful to or will not interfere with the sewage treatment process or will not
violate water quality or effluent standards.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, either directly or
indirectly to the sewerage system, any of the following described substances,
materials, waters, or wastes:
   (a)    Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees F;
    (b)    Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel, oil, mineral oil, or other
volatile flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas.
   (c)    Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance which, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, is capable of creating a public nuisance or
hazard to life or of preventing entry into the sewers for their maintenance and
repair.
   (d)    Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.0,
or having any other corrosive property of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment, or personnel of the sewerage system.
    (e)    Any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, punch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, lime
slurry, lime, chemical, or paint residues, cannery wastes, bulk solids, or any
other solid objects or viscous substance capable or causing obstruction to the
flow operation of the sewerage system.
    (f)   Any waters or wastes containing a toxic or poisonous substance in
sufficient quantity to injure or interfere with any sewerage treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, or create a hazard in the receiving
waters of the sewerage system.
    (g)    Any water or wastes containing emulsified oil or grease exceeding,
on analysis, an average of 50 milligrams of oil and grease per liter determined
as total soluble matter.
    (h)    Any garbage that has not been properly shredded to a degree that all
particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions of the sewer and
with no particle greater than ½ inch in any dimension.
    (i)    Any water or wastes containing suspended solids of such character or
quality that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials
at the sewage treatment plant, or having a chlorine demand greater than 25
milligrams per liter.
    (j)    Any waste containing substances that would result in a violation of
the NPDES permit.
   The above list is subject to revisions as required to meet current water
quality standards imposed by the state or federal agencies.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall limit the right of the City to
reject wastes, require the pretreatment of wastes, levy surcharges for the
treatment of wastes, or to contract for a special agreement or arrangement for
the treatment and disposal of wastes unless such actions are contrary to State
and/or Federal laws and/or regulations.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.03 NONACCEPTABLE WASTEWATER AND INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   The City shall make and enforce rules and regulations establishing the
types and characteristics of sewage, industrial wastes, and other matters which
shall be discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, the types and
characteristics of sewage and industrial wastes admissible to the system only
after pretreatment, requisites for pretreatment, and otherwise governing the
discharge of sewage, industrial wastes, and other matters into the system in
the interest of safety and efficient operation of the wastewater treatment
plant. Applicable industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial
pretreatment regulations, as promulgated under Section 307(b) of the Clean
Water Act and included in 40 CFR Part 403, are hereby incorporated in this
chapter and made a part hereof.
 
   (b)    An industry must, upon application for sewer service, present to the
City a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be discharged to
sewerage system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is not available, the
expected waste analysis based on similar processes now in operation. New
industries or industries with significant increases in discharge volume or
strength must submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval from the City before discharging to the sanitary sewer system.
 
   (c)    In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it will
damage the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the City shall compel such users to dispose of such
waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
 
   (d)    In cases where the character of the sewage or industrial waste from
any manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it
imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage collection, pumping, or
treatment works greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering the
sewerage system, the City may: compel such manufacturing or industrial plant,
building, or premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as specified by
the City before discharging it into the sewerage system; require flow control
or equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug" loads or excessive
loads that may be harmful to the treatment works; or require payment of a
surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works
to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and treating such wastes.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.04 INTERCEPTORS AND CONTROL MANHOLE.
   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the City, they are necessary for proper handling of liquid wastes containing
grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, and other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily removable
covers which when bolted in place shall be gaslight and watertight. Where
installed, all grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the
owner at his expense, in continuous efficient operation at all times.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.05 TESTS AND ANALYSES.
   (a)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater" published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples shall be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD, and/or COD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.
 
   (b)    When necessary by special contract or by this chapter, wastes which
have a strength exceeding 2100 pounds BOD per million gallons (250 mg/1) or
2100 pounds suspended solids per million gallons (250 mg/1) shall be subject to
a surcharge. The description and method of calculating the surcharge are as
outlined in Section
923.09.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.06 EQUIPMENT.
   (a)    Shut-off valves shall be installed on all industrial connections to
the sewer system at the expense of the industry making the connection. The
valve shall be controlled only by the Superintendent or his authorized
personnel.
 
   (b)    A non-clog type of measuring device shall be installed on all
industrial discharge lines connected to the sewer system and continuous type
recording devices (twenty-four hours) shall be installed at the Waste Water
Works and telemetering shall be provided for and maintained. The installation
and maintenance for this equipment shall be borne by the industry discharging
the industrial wastes.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.07 WASTEWATER MONITORING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewaters
to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of production
and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts and concentrations
of such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable state or federal pretreatment
standards or requirements.
 
   (b)    Such records shall be made available upon request by the City. All
such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made
available to officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
upon demand.
 
   (c)    If so ordered by the City, the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense a control manhole and suitable monitoring equipment to be used
for the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected.
 
   (d)    The control manhole and monitoring equipment shall be located and
maintained on the industrial user's premises outside the building. When such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may
allow such a facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way, with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of such right-of-way, and
located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping, or
parked vehicles.
 
   (e)    When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge.
 
   (f)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
 
   (g)    Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section
923.03 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour
period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the
City in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
 
   (h)    Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standards Methods",
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U.S. EPA,
or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA). In addition, all measurement, tests, and analysis of the characteristics
of wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the October 16, 1975
Federal Register (40 CFR Part 136) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants".
 
   (i)    Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination, with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in
Section
923.03, will be done at such intervals as designated by the City.
 
   (j)    Duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper credentials and
identifications shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
 
   (k)    Duly authorized City employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may
withhold information considered confidential provided that the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
 
   (l)    While performing necessary work for private properties, referred to
in subsection (j) hereof above, the City or duly authorized employees of the
City shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.08  SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.09 SURCHARGES ON ABOVE-NORMAL WASTEWATERS.
   When either or both the total suspended solids and BOD of acceptable wastes
or wastewater exceed the values ascribed to in Section
923.05(b), the excess concentration of either or both, as the case may be,
shall be evaluated volumetrically in terms of "Normal Waste" and be subject to
surcharge on the derived volume in accordance with the following formula:
 
         Sv = (Sw-2100)X 0.90 X F X 133,690
               2100
 
         Plus(Bw-2100) X 0.90 X F X 133,690
               2100
 
         which reduced to its simplest form is
 
         Sv = F [(Sw-2100) 57 Plus (Bw-2100) 57]
 
Sv = the derived volume of wastes subject
         to surcharge expressed in cubic feet
 
         Sw = the pounds per million gallons in the
         wastes as discharged denoting "suspended
         solids"
 
         Bw = the pounds per million gallons of the
         waste as discharged denoting "BOD"
 
         0.90 = factor allowance of 90% degree of
         removals
 
         F = the flow expressed in millions of gallons
         of the wastes as discharged
 
         133,690 = factor to convert millions of gallons
         to an equivalent in cubic feet
 
(Ord. 13-2001. Passed 2-20-01.)
 
923.10 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   (a)    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is part of the sewage works. Whoever violates
this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly
conduct.
 
   (b)    No person shall empty underground or other storage tanks containing

   (a)   Fee Established. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, each and
every Residential Developed Property, Non-Residential Developed property and
Vacant Improved Property, other than Exempt Property, and the owners and non-
owner uses thereof, have imposed upon them a stormwater Drainage Fee. In the
event the owner and non-owner users of a particular Property are not the same,
the liability for each the owner and non-owner uses for the Drainage Fee
attributable to that Property shall be joint and several. The Drainage Fee
shall be a monthly or annual service charge and shall be determined by the
provisions of this Chapter and the ERU and ERU rates which shall be established
and changed from time to time by City Council.
   (b)   Drainage Fee for Residential Developed Property. The Drainage Fee for
Residential Developed Property shall be the ERU Rate multiplied by the number
of individual Dwelling Units existing on the property. In the event of a newly
constructed Dwelling Unit, the charge for the Drainage Fee attributable to that
Dwelling Unit shall commence upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for that Dwelling Unit, or if construction is at least fifty percent (50%)

the ERU Rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
Impervious Area of a Non-Residential Developed Property by the number of square
feet in one ERU. The minimum Drainage Fee for any Non-Residential Developed
Property shall be equal to one ERU Rate. In the event of newly developed Non-

Director's designee determines in reasonable judgment that said development is
substantially complete or has been halted for at least three (3) months.
         (Ord. 62-2000. Passed 8-8-00.)
      (2)   The drainage fee for non-residential developed property shall be
the ERU rate ($4.00) multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing
the total impervious area of a non-residential developed property by the number
of square feet in one ERU (2,506 SF).
                     Impervious area SF
            ($4) Rate per ERU   X         =Fee
                     2,506 SF per ERU
      (3)   In the event of separately metered non-residential developed
property with joint users of common impervious areas, the Director shall
calculate and allocate the pre-rate drainage fee among the users. Any owner or
non-owner user disagreeing with the Director’s calculation or allocation may
appeal such determination to the Director as provided in subsection (e) hereof.
(Ord. 14- 2003. Passed 3-18-03.)
   (d)   Dwelling Unit and Impervious Surface Calculation. The Director or
Director's designee shall initially, and from time to time, determine the
number of Dwelling Units located on Residential Developed Property in order to
establish the Drainage Fee provided by paragraph (b) hereof. Non- Residential
Real Property in the City of Bucyrus shall have its square footage Impervious
Area calculated in order to establish the Drainage Fee provided by paragraph
(c) hereof. The Director or the Director's Designee shall make the initial
calculation and may from time to time change this calculation from such
information and date deemed pertinent by the Director or the Director's
designee. (Ord. 62-2000. Passed 8-8-00.)
   (e)   Appeal of Dwelling Unit and Impervious Surface Calculation. Any person
disagreeing with the calculations of the stormwater drainage fee as provided in
this chapter as follows:
      (1)   Any owner who paid his or her stormwater utility fees and who
believes the ERU component of his stormwater utility fee to be incorrect, may
submit an adjustment request to the City Service/Safety Director.
      (2)   Adjustments requested by an owner making the request shall be in
writing and set forth in detail the ground upon which relief is sought.
      (3)   The owner requesting the adjustments may be required at their own
costs to provide supplemental information to the Service/Safety Director or his
designee including but not limited to: survey data approved by an Ohio
registered Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) which presents the amount of
impervious area and non-compacted ground area on a parcel and/or engineering
reports approved by an Ohio registered Professional Engineer (PE). Failure to
provide such information may result in the denial of the adjustment request.
      (4)   The City Service/Safety Director or his designee will make
adjustments to the stormwater utility fee upon the granting of the adjustment
request in writing. The Service/Safety Director or his designee shall make
denials of adjustment requests in writing.
      (5)   Adjustment denials may be appealed to the Stormwater Utility
Appeals Board in writing within thirty (30) days after the denial has been
issued. The appeal must cite specific error by the Service/Safety Director and
the calculation that the party feels is correct. The appeal shall set forth in
full (or attach a complete copy of):
         A.   The interpretations, ruling or order appealed from and
         B.   The provisions of the City Code or related laws or ordinances.
   The appeal shall also state, with specificity, where in the interpretation,
ruling or order is erroneous. If the appeal is based upon a request for local
adjustment and/or system wide adjustment, the appeal shall specify the
provisions from which the adjustment is sought, and how the request otherwise
satisfies and does not significantly conflict with other requirements. The
Stormwater Utility Appeals Board shall review the record presented and enter
into a written decision as soon as practical. The Stormwater Utility Appeals
Board may request additional information from either party. The decision of the
Stormwater Utility Appeals Board is final.
(Ord. 14-2003. Passed 3-18-03.)
   (f)   Drainage Fee for Vacant Improved Property. The Drainage Fee for Vacant
Improved Property shall be based on the area of the Vacant Improved Property
and shall be equal to the fraction of the ERU rate which reflects the quantity
and quality of the stormwater runoff attributed to Vacant Improved Property in
the City as identified by Resolution of City Council.    
   (g)   Drainage Fee for Undisturbed Property. Undisturbed Property shall be
exempt from the Stormwater Utility fee. (Ord. 62-2000. Passed 8-8-00.)
927.07 STORMWATER DRAINAGE FEE COLLECTION.
   (a)   The drainage fee for metered property shall be billed and collected
monthly with the monthly City’s services utility bill for those properties
utilizing the City utilities and billed and collected separately as stormwater
drainage fees for those properties not utilizing other City utilities. The
Water Department shall render all such bills for drainage fees monthly. The
drainage fee for those properties utilizing City utilities is part of a
consolidated statement for utility customers, which is generally paid by a
single payment. In the event that a partial payment is received, the payment
shall be applied pro-rate to each account billed on the consolidated statement
in the proportion that an individual account bears to the total consolidated
statement of all current charges for all accounts. The drainage fee for
unmetered property shall be billed monthly. All bills for drainage fees shall
become due and payable in accordance with the rules and regulations established
by the Water Department pertaining to the collection of the drainage fees.
(Ord. 14-2003. Passed 3-18-03.)
   (b)   If the bill for the drainage fee is not paid in full within twenty-one
(21) days of the billing date posted on the bill received by the customer, the
gross charge will be due. This will be equal to the net charge plus 10%. The
City shall be entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in collecting
delinquent Drainage Fees. Any charge due hereunder which shall not be paid when
due may be recovered in an action at law by the City of Bucyrus. In addition to
any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the
City of Bucyrus, failure of any user of City utilities within the City of
Bucyrus to pay said charges promptly when due shall subject such user to
discontinuance of utility services and the Director or the Director's Designee
may enforce this provision as to any and all delinquent users. The employees of
the City shall, at all reasonable times, have access to any premises served by
the City for inspection, repair or the enforcement of the provisions of this
Chapter.
   (c)   All Drainage Fees assessed pursuant to this chapter shall be a lien
upon the property to which such fee is associated from the date said fee
becomes due until such fee is paid. The owner of every building, premises, or
house shall be obligated to pay the fee for all service provided for this
premises, which obligation may be enforced by the City by action at law or suit
to enforce the lien in the same manner as the foreclosure of mortgages. In the
event of such action, the City shall be entitled to recover all court costs and
reasonable attorney fees for such collection. In the case that a tenant in
possession of any premises or building shall pay said charges, it shall relieve
the land owner from such obligation and lien; but the City shall not be
required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for the payment
of such charges. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the
application of this chapter, and the failure of any owner to learn that he
purchased property against which a lien for Drainage Fees exists shall in no
way affect his responsibility for such payment. (Ord. 62-2000. Passed 8-8-00.)
927.08 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR REGIONAL STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   City Ordinance(s) may require, or may in the future require,
construction of on-site stormwater management facilities to control stormwater
quantity and quality in the event of development. Implementation of regional
stormwater management facilities may, in some cases, render construction of on-
site facilities unnecessary. For use in these cases, the City shall adopt
procedures and standards to require developers of land to provide a one-time
capital contribution toward construction of regional stormwater management
facilities in lieu of construction of on-site stormwater facilities. Such one-
time capital contribution shall not affect the obligation for payment of any
Drainage Fee assessed pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   The one-time capital contribution may be available to developments
which meet the following conditions:
      (1)   An adopted drainage basin study has identified an area within which
the stormwater management facilities normally required to be created on-site
are unnecessary; and
      (2)   The development is located within an area so identified; and
      (3)   Implementation of regional stormwater management facilities
required by the adopted drainage basin study is complete or under construction.
   (c)   For developments which meet the conditions specified previously in
this section, the Director, upon review of the development plans, shall require
a development agreement which shall be presented for final approval to City
Council.
   (d)   The amount of the one-time capital contribution shall be based upon
that percentage of the regional stormwater management facility capacity which
is to be allocated to the development. (Ord. 62-2000. Passed 8-8-00.)

the original amount, the developer shall replenish the balance to the amount
originally required within thirty (30) days of being notified to accomplish
same or forfeit the entire remaining balance. Likewise, if the amount of said
letter of credit or maintenance bond balance should be diminished after the
initial eighteen (18) month term to less than ten percent (10%) of the
estimated cost of curbs, streets and sidewalks during the period from eighteen
(18) months to twenty-four (24) months after the date of acceptance or
approval, or less than five percent (5%) of the estimated cost of curbs,
streets and sidewalks during the period from twenty-four (24) months to thirty
(30) months after the date of acceptance or approval, or less than two and one-
half percent (2.5%) of the estimated cost of curbs, streets and sidewalks
during the period from thirty (30) months to thirty-six (36) months after the
date of acceptance or approval, the developer shall replenish the balance to
the full amount of the respective percentage of estimated cost of said
improvements required by this declining balance formula within thirty (30) days
of being notified to accomplish same or forfeit the entire remaining balance.
   (f)   When the developer fails to correct and deficiency or failure in the
improvements covered by the maintenance guaranties set forth herein, then the
Municipality, after giving notice which it deems reasonable under the
particular circumstances, shall utilize such letter of credit or maintenance
bond to effect any necessary repairs.

1129.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulations in this chapter, shall control the manner in which streets,
lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land. These design
controls shall help insure convenient and safe streets, creation of usable
lots, provision of space for public utilities and reservation of land for
recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
   The Planning Commission has responsibility for reviewing the design of each
future subdivision early in its design development and shall insure that all
requirements of this chapter are met. (Ord. 70-74. Passed 10-15-74.)
1129.02 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform to appropriate Major
Thoroughfare Plans. Thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned plans
shall conform to the recommendation of the Planning Commission based upon
design standards set forth in Section
1129.03 to
1129.12, inclusive. No final plat of land within the area in which existing
zoning regulations are in effect shall be approved unless it conforms with such
regulation. (Ord. 70-74. Passed 10-15-74.)
1129.03 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage,
topography, inadequate water supply, schools, transportation facilities and
other such conditions which may endanger health, life or property and, if from
investigations conducted by public agencies concerned, it is determined that in
the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for the
purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving problems
that will be created by development of the land.
(Ord. 70-74. Passed 10-15-74.)
1129.04 STREET DESIGN AND STANDARDS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction and location
of all streets shall conform to all appropriate Major Thoroughfare Plans or
subsequent amendments thereto, and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, topographical conditions and public convenience
and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land
to be served by such streets. The street pattern shall discourage through
traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide within
the boundaries of the subdivision plat the necessary right of way for the
widening, continuance or alignment of such streets in conformity with Major
Thoroughfare Plans.
   The design and improvement standards contained in Table 1 herein are
suggested minimums. All streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with standards as specified.
   All thoroughfare entrances and exits to and from any new subdivision within
the City must have minimum right-of-way widths of fifty feet and minimum paved
surface widths of twenty-six feet. (Ord. 74-77. Passed 12-27-77.)

   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (a)    Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan and only if
a temporary turn-around satisfactory to the Planning Commission in design is
provided, and provisions for maintenance and removal are advanced. Temporary
dead-end streets longer than 200 feet shall not be permitted.
   (b)    Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
   (c)    Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street shall be designed, if the subdivision design is such that residential
lots would require direct vehicular access onto the arterial highway. Points of
access to the arterial street shall be spaced at a minimum of 1320 feet. A
planting strip having a minimum width of twenty feet shall be provided between
the pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access
street. The minimum width of the marginal access right of way shall be fifty
feet.
   (d)    Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions, except
where justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in commercial and

access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be twenty-five feet for the right
of way and twenty feet for the pavement width.
      (Ord. 70-74. Passed 10-15-74.)
1129.09 STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local
streets. The intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or
collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible
interference with traffic movement on the streets, and shall be located not
less than 100 feet from the intersection of an arterial or collector street
with any other street, and shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each

administration of this Ordinance may be taken by any owner of property with a
substantial interest in the matter who is adversely affected, or by a
governmental officer, department, Commission, or bureau. Such appeal shall be
taken within twenty (20) days after the date of the decision by the Zoning
Inspector, by filing with the Zoning Inspector or with the Service Director, a
notice of appeal specifying the decision of the Zoning Inspector from which the
appeal is being taken.
1147.02 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, filed as hereinafter provided, such variances from the
provisions or requirements of the Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
provisions or requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and
buildings involved. No variance from strict application of any provision of
this Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that all the
following facts and conditions exist:
(Ord. 7-2002. Passed 3-19-02; Ord. 35-2004. Passed 8-24-04.)
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
physical conditions specific to the land or building for which the variance is
sought, and such conditions do not apply generally to land or buildings in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such unreasonable and unnecessary hardship has not been created
by the appellant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance that would allow a use not permissible under this Ordinance in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Ordinance in said district.
1147.03 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE AND APPEALS.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning permit, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from the
decision of the Zoning Inspector. An application for a variance or appeal shall
be filed with the Zoning Inspector or Service Director on a form as specified
for that purpose. The Zoning Inspector shall forward a copy of the application
for variance to the Board of Zoning Appeals. In cases of appeal, the
application shall be processed by the Service Director.

contiguous to, and directly across the street from the property, as appearing
on the Crawford County Auditor's current tax list.

provisions of this Ordinance which apply.
   (f)   A narrative statement explaining the following:
      (1)   The use for which variance or appeal is sought.
      (2)   Details of the variance or appeal that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the variance or appeal should be granted,
as the case may be.
      (3)   The specific reasons why the variance or appeal is justified,
according to Section
1147.02 .
   (g)   A fee, as established by City Council.
1147.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section
1143.10.
1147.05 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing for consideration of
an appeal from a decision of the Zoning Inspector. The Board may hold a public
hearing for a variance unless a resolution is passed, by affirmative vote,
declaring that a hearing is not needed in the specific case being considered.
1147.06 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Any appeal or variance requested under part 11, Planning and Zoning Code
shall comply with the public notice requirements as set forth herein:
   (a)   Before holding the public hearing pursuant to Section

required of notice published in newspapers as specified above. Parties of
interest shall include owners of property within 200 feet from, contiguous to,
and directly across the street from the property being considered. Failure of
delivery of such notice shall not invalidate the findings of the Board, and
   (b)   The owner of the property requesting a variance or appeal, or the
applicant for the appeal or variance, shall clearly and conspicuously post a
sign providing notice of a public hearing on the property for which the appeal
or variance was requested, for a period not less than fourteen (14) days prior
to the scheduled hearing.
      (1)   The sign for such notice shall be in the format provided by the
City of Bucyrus. The required sign shall be available for purchase from the
City of Bucyrus for $10.00. Any second, or replacement sign, shall be made
available for $10.00.
      (2)   The sign shall provide the date of the hearing, the type of appeal,

rules shall require the Board of Zoning Appeals to reject the application for
Appeal, Variance or other relief. A violation of these notice rules does not
preclude the Applicant or property owner filing a new application, paying a new
filing fee and complying with the notice provisions.
   (c)   Any Applicant or property owner that moves, removes or intentionally
alters or obscures a posted public notice sign shall have their application
terminated pursuant to subsection (b)(4) hereof. Any party that removes, alters
or obscures a public notice sign shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the 4th
degree, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $250.00.

1147.07 ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS .
   Within sixty (60) days after the first regular meeting of the Board of
Zoning Appeals following submittal of an application filed pursuant to Section
1147.03, the Board shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions
as specified in Section
1147.04, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. If the application
is approved, or approved with supplementary conditions, the Board shall make a
finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of

structure. If the request for appeal or variance is denied, the reasons for
such denial shall be noted in writing. The Board shall transmit a written copy
of its decision and findings to the Zoning Inspector, who shall forward such
copy to the applicant by first class mail, or in person.

1149.01 PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances, a use which more intensely affects an area
than those uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may
nonetheless be compatible with permitted uses, if that use is properly
controlled and regulated. Such uses shall be listed as conditional uses within
the respective zoning districts. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant
conditional approval for use of the land, buildings, or other structures and
may allow such a use to be established where unusual circumstances exist and
where the conditional use will be consistent with the general purpose and
intent of this Zoning Resolution.
1149.02 APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an application
to use such property for one of the conditional uses provided for by this
Ordinance in the zoning district in which the property is situated. An
application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, who
shall forward a copy to the Board of Zoning Appeals. At a minimum the
application shall contain the following information:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant.
   (b)   Legal description of the property.
   (c)   Present zoning district.
   (d)   Description of existing and proposed uses.
   (e)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic circulation,
utilities and such other information as the Board may require to determine if
the proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this
Ordinance.
   (f)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining properties;
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, light, fumes and vibration
on such property and a discussion of the general compatibility of the proposed
use with adjacent and other properties in the area.
   (g)   The names and addresses of all property owners within 200 feet,
contiguous to, and directly across the street from the property, as appearing
on the Crawford County Auditor's current tax list.
   (h)   Such other information regarding the property, proposed use, or
surrounding area as may be pertinent to the deliberations of the Board.
1149.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for conditional uses as specified
in the district regulations, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of the proposed use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence that such use at the
proposed location meets all of the following requirements:
   (a)   The use is in fact a conditional use as established under the district
regulations.
   (b)   The use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as
to be harmonious and appropriate with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of
the same area.
   (c)   The use will not pose a discernible hazard to existing adjacent uses.
   (d)   The use will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools.
   (e)   The use will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons,
property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors.
   (f)   The use will be consistent with the objectives of this Zoning
Ordinance.
1149.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with the purposes and intent of this
Ordinance.
1149.05 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may hold a public hearing for the purpose of
receiving input on the specific case being considered. If a public hearing is
held, the requirements for public notice and notification of parties of
interest shall be the same as for appeals and variances, as specified in
Section
1147.05 and
1147.06.
1149.06 ACTION BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within sixty (60) days after the next regular meeting of the Board following
the submittal of the application pursuant to Section
1149.02 of this Ordinance, the Board shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1149.04, or disapprove the application as presented. If the application is
approved with supplementary conditions, the Zoning Inspector shall state on the
zoning permit the specific conditions listed by the Board for approval. If the
application is disapproved, the applicant may seek relief through the Court of
Common Pleas, pursuant to the guidelines and procedures specified in Section
1147.08.
1149.07 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION OF ZONING PERMIT ISSUED UNDER CONDITIONAL USE
PROVISIONS.
   The approval of the zoning permit issued in accordance with Section
1149.06 shall become null and void if such use is not carried out within one
(1) year after date of approval. The Board may revoke the zoning permit upon
written evidence by any residents of the City of violation of the Zoning
Ordinance and/or written terms and conditions upon which approval was based.
The Board is authorized to grant an extension of a zoning permit issued
pursuant to Section
1149.06, for an additional period of not more than one (1) year.

1151.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance, or amendments
hereinafter adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and
structure which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendments.
   Such uses and/or structures, provided they were lawfully existing as of the
effective date of this Ordinance, are hereby granted full protection of the
law, pursuant to Section 713.15 of the Ohio Revised Code. It is the intent of
this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue and to permit
reasonable extensions as allowed by law.
1151.02 WHEN PERMITTED.
   (a)   Existing Land or Buildings. Any use of land or buildings existing on
the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, even though such use
does not conform to the provisions herein, so long as such use was in
conformity with the zoning ordinance in effect in the City at the time that the
use or structure was established. No nonconforming building, structure, or use
shall be moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered,
except as specifically provided in this Ordinance.
   (b)   Construction Commenced. Any property purchased or acquired in good
faith for any nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, upon
which property the work of changing, remodeling or construction of such
nonconforming use has been legally commenced at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance, may be used for the nonconforming use for which such changing,
remodeling or construction was undertaken, provided that such work is completed
within two (2) years from the date of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment
thereto making said use nonconforming.
1151.03 SUBSTITUTION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow the nonconforming use of a building or
structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more
restricted classification, provided no structural alterations except those
required by law or ordinance are made. No additional signs or sign area
intended to be viewed from off the premises shall be allowed for any
nonconforming business use existing in a district where single-family homes are
a permitted use.
1151.04 EXTENSION.
   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, except as follows:
   (a)   The Board may permit, on a once-only basis, a building containing a
nonconforming use to be enlarged to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%)
of the ground floor area of the existing building or structure devoted to a
nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or at the time of
its amendment making the use non conforming. The Board except under conditions
of a variance pursuant to Chapter
1147, shall not authorize an extension which would result in a violation of the
provision of this Ordinance with respect to any adjoining premises, or which
would occupy ground space required for meeting the yard or other requirements
of this Ordinance.
   (b)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
   (c)   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a non- residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered provided it meets the requirements of the
adjacent or most proximate R- District.
   (d)   Any structure which is nonconforming due to its location or
configuration on the lot, resulting in lot coverage or yards inconsistent with
the requirements of the zoning district where it is located, may be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered in a manner that decreases or maintains its
existing degree of nonconformity, but in no case shall such structure be
enlarged, extended or structurally altered in a manner that increases its
degree of nonconformity.
      (Ord. 7-2002. Passed 3-19-02.)
   (e)   Legally nonconforming residential lots currently in zoning districts
that do not permit single-family structures are permitted to install, build or
construct accessory structures provided that the accessory structure meets
development standards for the adjacent or most proximate residential district;
including that district’s process for variances. (Ord. 50-2019. Passed 10-1-
19.)
1151.05 DISCONTINUANCE.
   (a)   A nonconforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be
returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered
abandoned whenever any one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of two
(2) years.
      (2)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
   (b)   Reinstatement. Properties which have fallen into discontinuance can
apply for reinstatement of a nonconforming use. Applications for reinstatement
of a nonconforming use may be submitted to the Planning Commission by at least
one (1) owner of property or his/her designated agent per the following
requirements:
      (1)   Contents of Application. An application shall be submitted by the
applicant to the Planning Commission via the Zoning Administrator and shall
contain, at a minimum, the following information:
         A.   Name, address, and phone number of the applicant.
         B.   Present use, previous use, and district.
         C.   Specific proposed nonconforming use and statement explaining how
the proposed reinstatement will impact adjacent and proximate properties.

and directly across the street from the parcel(s) proposing the reinstatement
and their address as appearing on the Crawford County Auditor's current tax
list.
         F.   A fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00).
         G.   Any other information as may be requested by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)    Recommendation by Planning Commission. Within thirty (30) days
after the first regular meeting of the Planning Commission after the receipt of
the proposed reinstatement, the Planning Commission shall recommend to City
Council that the reinstatement be approved as requested, approved with
conditions, or it may recommend that the amendment be denied. In formulating
such recommendation, the Planning Commission may seek input from interested
parties in the form of hearings, meetings, or other methods.
      (3)    Public Hearing. Before the proposed reinstatement may be approved,
the City Council shall hold a public hearing, and shall give at least thirty
(30) days notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. Written notice of the hearing shall be made by the
Clerk of Council, by first-class mail, at least twenty (20) days before the
date of the public hearing to the owners of property within 200 feet or
contiguous to, and directly across the street from such parcel or parcels
applying for reinstatement of the discontinued use. Additionally, a sign
providing notice of a public hearing will be posted on the property for which
the reinstatement was requested, for a period not less than fourteen (14) days
prior to the scheduled hearing. The failure of delivery of such notice shall
not invalidate such proposed reinstatement.
      (4)    Action by City Council. No such reinstatement which is in
accordance with the recommendation submitted by the Planning Commission shall
be deemed to pass or take effect without the concurrence of at least a majority
of the membership of the City Council. No such Ordinance which violates,
differs from, or departs from the recommendation submitted by the Planning
Commission shall take effect unless passed or approved by not less than three
fourths (3/4) of the membership of the City Council.
      (5)    Criteria. In reviewing the proposed reinstatement of nonconforming
use and arriving at its decision, the City Council shall consider the following
factors
         A.   Commercial history of property including but not limited to:
prior usage, date of last use, etc.
         B.   Specific nonconforming use requested
         C.   Characteristics of adjacent properties and neighborhood and the

and other residents of the City including available off-street parking, vehicle
access, traffic flow, hours of operation, signage, etc.
         D.   Feedback received from neighboring property owners.
      (6)   Properties which have received City Council's approval for
reinstatement of a nonconforming use become subject to the full requirements of
nonconformities ordinance (BCO Chapter

         (Ord. 20-2022. Passed 4-19-22.)
1151.06 DAMAGE AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR USE.
   When a building or structure, the use or location of which does not conform
to the provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God,
or the public enemy, it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such
nonconforming use, provided that the following conditions are met:
   (a)   The restoration or rebuilding is commenced within six (6) months of
the time of damage, and construction is completed within one (1) year, and
   (b)   The damaged or destroyed building was not located in such a manner so
as to encroach on adjacent property, and
   (c)   Such restoration or rebuilding would not extend or expand the existing
use.
   If any part of the damaged or destroyed building encroached on adjacent
property, the locations of the restored or rebuilt structure is subject to
approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals. If the restoration or rebuilding of
the structure involves extension or expansion of the use, then the provisions
of Section
1151.04 shall apply.
1151.07 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and
repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use as follows:
   (a)   When required by law.
   (b)   To convert to a conforming use.
   (c)   A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses may
be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height requirements or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.
1151.08 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling or accessory building if the lot is already occupied by a one-family
residence, may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date
of this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has minimum area of 3,000 square feet and at least thirty five (35) feet of lot
width with frontage on a public street; and further provided the following
conditions are complied with:
   (a)   If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property and did not
own adjacent property at the time this Ordinance became effective:
      (1)   In any district where dwellings are permitted, two (2) inches may
be deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four (4)
inches from the required minimum width of both side yards for each foot that
the lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than three (3) feet.
      (2)   For lots having a depth of less than 110 feet, the depth of the
rear yard need not exceed 25 percent of the total depth of the lot, but shall
not be less than twenty (20) feet.
   (b)   If the owner of such lot owns adjacent property, or owned such
property at the time this Ordinance became effective, the modification of lot
area and yard dimensions as set forth above shall not apply, except as follows:
In order to erect a dwelling or dwellings thereon, the owner of two (2) or more
adjacent lots fronting on the same street shall redivide the lots in such a
manner that they conform with the lot area and yard requirements for a single-
family dwelling in that district where the lots are located. However, if the
average width of the lots resulting from such redivision would exceed the
required lot width for a single family dwelling by more than fifteen (15) feet,
such redivision, if any, may be made so as to provide one (1) more building lot
than would otherwise be permitted. In such case, the provisions of subsection
(a) hereof relating to the reduction of side and rear yards shall apply.

   (c)   Accessory Uses. An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use or
structure clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted building
or use, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use.
Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in accordance with the specific
district regulations, and the requirements of Chapter
1187.
   (d)   Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, in addition
to the development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity.
   In making such determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals may seek the input
of interested parties, including but not limited to adjacent property owners,
at public meetings or hearings established for that purpose. If such hearings
are held, the notification requirements shall be the same for variances as
specified in Chapter
1147.
   (e)   Similar Uses.
      (1)   Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses permitted by
right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of the district
and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use found similar
shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that district.
      (2)   Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in
the permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this Section,
shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)   Within thirty (30) days after such submittal, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses
permitted in the specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
         A.   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in
another zoning district.
         B.   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the district to
which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other
district.
         C.   Such use creates no danger to health and safety, creates no
offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other
objectionable influences, and does not create traffic congestion to an extent
greater than normally resulting from uses listed in the classification to which
it is to added.
   (f)   Development Standards. Development standards set forth shall be the
minimum allowed for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
   (g)   Development Plan.
      (1)   For particular uses in specific districts, a Development Plan will
be cited as required. In such cases, the Development Plan shall be submitted by
the applicant at the time of the application for a zoning permit, or at such
time when the property is rezoned into that district. The Development Plan
shall contain a site plan for the property, drawn to approximate scale, showing
all property lines and building outlines, access drives, parking areas, and
other notable physical features. The Development Plan shall also show the size,
design, materials and location of all signage proposed for the development. The
Development Plan shall contain a narrative description of the proposed use, and
how such use will impact adjacent residential property.
      (2)   The Development Plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission
and must be approved as a condition for the issuance of a zoning permit. In
approving a Development Plan, the Planning Commission shall find that the
following criteria have been met:
         A.   The proposed building or use shall have sufficient yard space to
provide for adequate parking and screening of adjacent residential areas in
accordance with this Article.
         B.   The Development Plan for the proposed facility identifies the
range of potential alleviate adverse impacts on adjacent residential areas and
incorporates measures to alleviate or significantly lessen such impacts and to
protect the residential character of such areas.
   (h)   Essential Services. Essential Services, as defined and specified in
Chapter
1139, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts within the City.

provisions of this R-3 District. It is the intent of this Ordinance, and this
district in particular, to protect and preserve the basic property rights of
such existing nonconforming uses. Specific provisions are made for the
continuance, substitution and extension of such use, pursuant to Chapter
1151 of this Ordinance and Section 713.15 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1179.01 PURPOSE.
   The GI and LIC Districts are established to provide for a range of
industrial as well as other employment-generating activity which may be
industrial/commercial in nature. Two (2) separate industrial districts are
established.
   (a)   GI - General Industrial District. This district provides areas where
most industrial and industrial-related activities may locate. Non-industrial
activities are limited and residential uses are prohibited. The district is
primarily intended for areas which are undeveloped, having larger lots and
irregular block patterns, but may also be utilized to encourage the adaptive
reuse of existing older industrial areas.
   (b)   LIC - Limited Industrial / Commercial District. This district provides
areas for a wider range of employment opportunities. The district allows for a
more restricted range of industrial activities, but a wider range of office,
business and retail uses. This district is particularly intended for areas
having high exposure to expressways or other arterial highways.
1179.02 PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL ACTIVITIES.
   Permitted and conditional activities in each district are as shown on the
following table. Descriptions and characteristics of activity categories listed
are contained in Section

include a salesperson, member of the clergy, lawyer, engineer, architect, real
estate consultant, accountant, artist, computer or telecommunications worker or

spaces shall be provided for all employees of the establishment.

1320.01 PROCEDURE.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86 (C) and (D), whereby no insurance company doing business within
the State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)    When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the company
equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on
all fire policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26 (F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds
to the Fire Chief in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim; or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured and the insurance company, the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate. Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro
rata basis by all companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy
proceeds remaining after the transfer to the City shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms. The named insured may submit a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the
amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured, provided
that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or
other structure.
      (Ord. 14-81. Passed 4-7-81; Ord. 65-99. Passed 9-7-99.)
   (b)    Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing the building
or structure incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261. When
transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof, an insurance
company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named insured
whereupon the City shall contact the same, certify that the proceeds have been
received by the City and notify them that the following procedures will be
followed:
    The fund shall be returned to the named insured when repairs, or removal or
securing of the building or other structure has been completed and the required
proof received by the designated officer, if the City has not incurred any
costs for such repairs, removal or securing. If the City incurs any costs for
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer
the remaining funds to the named insured. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the ability of a municipal corporation to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the municipal
corporation and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits
the transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition
of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (c)    The Fire Chief is hereby designated as the officer authorized to
carry out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a certified
copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State. (Ord.
14-81. Passed 4-7-81.)
1320.02 SPECIAL FUND ESTABLISHED.
   There is hereby established a new City special fund to be known as the
"Derelict Building Liability Fund" as the receptacle for funds received by the
City from insurance companies insuring premises within the City suffering fire
losses, as provided in this chapter.

1321.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Bucyrus, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Bucyrus has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplains;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling, filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which these Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Bucyrus as identified in Section
1321.01(f) including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Bucyrus. (Ord. 55-2003. Passed 12-16-03.)
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   “Flood Insurance Study Crawford County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” and “Flood Insurance Rate Map Crawford County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas”, both effective January 19, 2011.
         (Ord. 26-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Bucyrus as required by Section
1321.04(c) entitled Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Engineer's Office of the City of Bucyrus.
(Ord. 55-2003. Passed 12-16-03.)
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not intend to impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
(Ord. 6-2008. Passed 1-2-08.)
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Bucyrus, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 55-2003. Passed 12-16-03.)
1321.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

there is no practicable alternative. (Ord. 55-2003. Passed 12-16-03.)
   (9)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the Agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 6-2008. Passed 1-2-08.)
   (10)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (13)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths
are determined.
Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (15)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (17)   “Floodway” means a floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase
in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a
designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot
at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   “Historic Structure” means any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register.
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   “Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means a Letter of Map Change is an
official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance
Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional letter of Map Revision (CLOMP) means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   “Manufactured Home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   “Manufactured Home Park” means as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of
land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means the NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   “New Construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Bucyrus Flood Insurance Rate Map dated July 3, 1986 and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (28)   “Recreational Vehicle” means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single
chassis, (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (29)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (30)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (31)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (32)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   “Start of Construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvements to a structure which is considered “new
construction”.
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)    “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 55-2003. Passed 12-16-03.)
 
1321.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Zoning Administrator
is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and is

boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Bucyrus suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Bucyrus has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard.
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source;
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator;
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations;
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceeds the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1321.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damage structures; coordinating with other federal, state
and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing
owners of damaged structures materials and other information related to the
proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist
owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance
insurance claims.

            4.   Description of the existing use;
            5.   Description of the proposed use;
            6.   Location of the floodplain;
            7.   Description of the variance sought;
            8.   Reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the City of
Bucyrus.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations do not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages;
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1321.05(d)(3)A. - K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases;
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (f)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath;
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses;
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance;
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance;
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel;
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal;
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance;
      (8)   The Board shall prepare findings of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
   (g)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

to meet a requirement of this chapter, the City may order compliancy by written
notice of violation to the responsible person. If abatement of a violation and/
or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to
the violator. Such notice may require without limitation:
   (a)    The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

   (a)   In addition to any other remedies, should any person fail to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, City may, after giving notice and
opportunity for compliance, have City personnel or authorized representative
complete necessary work. The project or property owner shall be required to
promptly reimburse the City for all costs of such work. If the amount due is
not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the City or
the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this article shall become liable to the town by reason of such
violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal
payments. Interest at a rate of one percent (1%) per annum shall be assessed on
the balance beginning on the first day following discovery of the violation.
   (b)   In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized
by this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator

   1333.20 SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM.
   (a)    Suspension Due to Emergency Situations. The City may, without prior
notice, suspend storm drainage system discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm drain system or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, town may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the storm drain system or waters of the United States, or
to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm drain system in violation of this chapter may have
their storm drain system access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The City will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city and/or
permitting officer for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (c)    §53.805 Corrective Action. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City from taking such other lawful action as may be necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person
or persons responsible. Costs include, but are not limited to, repairs to the
storm drain system made necessary by the violation, as well as those penalties
levied by the EPA or OEPA for violation of the City's NPDES permit, attorney
fees, and other costs and expenses.
(Ord. 24-2022. Passed 6-21-22.)
   1333.21 APPEALS.
   (a)    Any person to whom any provision of this chapter has been applied may
appeal in writing, not later than thirty (30) days after the action or decision
being appealed from, to the City the action or decision whereby any such
provision was so applied. Such appeal shall identify the matter being appealed,
and the basis for the appeal.
   (b)    The City shall consider the appeal and decide whereby it affirms,
rejects or modifies the action being appealed. In considering such appeal, the

the terms of this chapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the
action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements
are satisfied:
      (1)    The application of the chapter provisions being appealed will
present or cause practical difficulties for a development or development site;
provided; however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need for
the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses to comply with this
chapter; and
      (2)    The granting of the relief requested will not substantially
prevent the goals and purposes of this chapter, nor result in less effective
management of stormwater runoff. (Ord. 24-2022. Passed 6-21-22.)
   1333.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person found in violation of any provisions of this chapter shall
be responsible for a civil infraction and subject to a maximum fine of five
thousand dollars ($5,000) for a first offense, and a maximum of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) for a subsequent offense, plus costs, damages, and expenses.
Each day such violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate offense
and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for each day.
The rights and remedies provided for in this section are cumulative and in
addition to any other remedies provided by law. An admission or determination
of responsibility shall not exempt the offender from compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (b)    Any person who aids or abets a person in violation of this chapter
shall be subject to the penalties provided in this section.
   (c)    For the purposes of this section, "subsequent offense" means a
violation of the provisions of this chapter committed by the same person within
twelve (12) months of a previous violation of the same provision of this
chapter for which said person admitted responsibility or was adjudicated to be
responsible.
