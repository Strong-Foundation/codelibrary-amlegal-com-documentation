EDITOR'S NOTE
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (b)   Effective January 1, 2024, the Village Fiscal Officer shall perform
those duties provided by law and any other consistent with the nature of the

shall not be limited to, the attached exhibit of originial Ordinance 2021-3,
incorporated herein by reference.
   (c)   The Fiscal Officer need not be an elector of the Village, and any
requirement that the Fiscal Officer be a resident of the Village is hereby
waived.
(Ord. 2021-3. Passed 2-7-22.)
133.02 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST POLICY.
   The records request policy establishes procedures for responding to requests
for public records. This policy supersedes any and all previous records request
policies.
(a)   Mission Statement. It is the policy of the Village of Haskins that
openness leads to a better informed citizenry, which leads to better government
and better public policy. Consistent with the premise that government at all
levels exists first and foremost to serve the interests of the people, it is
the mission and intent of the Village of Haskins to at all times fully comply
with and abide by both the spirit and the letter of Ohio’s Public Records Act.
   (b)   Defining Public Records.
(1)   All records of the Village of Haskins are public unless they are
specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code, or are
confidential attorney-client work product or communications.
(2)   All records must be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying.
(3)   Public records are defined to include the following: Any document –
paper, electronic (including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format –
that is created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of the Village
of Haskins that documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.
(4)   Documents in electronic mail format are public records when their content
relates to the business of the Village of Haskins.
(5)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this Village are
required to copy their e-mails that relate to public business to their business
e-mail accounts and retain them in accordance with applicable records retention
schedules.
   (c)   Records Custodian. The Clerk-Treasurer is the official Public Records
Custodian of all records which are centrally maintained by the Village of
Haskins. Department heads are the official custodians of all records maintained
within their departments. However, all public records requests must directed to
the Clerk-Treasurer or the Village Administrator.
   (d)   Public Inspection.
(1)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular business
hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must be made
available for inspection promptly.
(2)   In processing a request for inspection of a public record, the Clerk-
Treasurer, Village Administrator or a designee must accompany the requester
during inspection to make certain original records are not taken or altered.
   (e)   Request for Record Copies.
(1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it is not
clear what records are being sought, the office must contact the requester for
clarification, and should assist the requester in revising the request by
informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps its records.
(2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and does
not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. It is the general policy of the Village of Haskins that this
information is not to be requested.
(3)   If a request is for records that may be exempt or prohibited from
disclosure, or if the request presents a high probability of litigation or any
other unique issue, the Clerk-Treasurer, Village Administrator or a designee
must contact the Village Solicitor as the request is being processed.
(4)   Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable
period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of
records requested; the proximity of the location where the records are stored;
and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
(5)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time required
to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be satisfied
immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are not limited
to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
(6)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing within three business days following the office’s
receipt of the request.
(7)   In processing the request, the Village of Haskins does not have an
obligation to create new records or perform new analysis of existing
information. An electronic record is deemed to exist so long as a computer is
already programmed to produce the record through simple sorting, filtering, or
querying. Although not required by law, the office should accommodate the
requestor by generating new records, in order to make otherwise public records
available and protect records that are legitimately exempt from disclosure,
when it makes sense and is practical under the circumstances.
   (f)   Denial or Redaction of a Request.
(1)   If the requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for public records, the request may be denied,
but the denial must provide the requester an opportunity to revise the request
by informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained and
accessed by the office.
(2)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If the initial request was made in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
(3)   If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt
portions are to be redacted and the rest released.
(4)   All redactions shall be plainly visible. If there are redactions, each
redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal
authority.
   (g)   Copying and Mailing Costs.
(1)   Those seeking public records may be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, not labor:
   .   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page.
   .    The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
(2)   A requester may be required to pay in advance for costs involved in
providing the copy.
(3)   The requester may choose whether to have the record duplicated upon
paper, upon the same medium in which the public record is kept, or any other
medium on which the record can be duplicated.
(4)   If a requester asks that documents be mailed to them, they will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies. There is no charge
for documents emailed.
(h)   Retention Schedule. The Village of Haskins Records Commission shall
establish a Records Retention Schedule which is available for inspection at the
Village of Haskins Town Hall.
   (i)   Policy Posting. Notice of the Village of Haskins's Public Records
Policy will be posted in a conspicuous place at the Town Hall as well as on the
Village's official website. All employees of the Village of Haskins will be
advised of such postings as well as how they may download a copy of the most
recent edition of the Ohio Sunshine Law Manual.
   (j)   Failure to Comply. The Village of Haskins recognizes the legal and
non-legal consequences of failure to properly respond to a public records
request. In addition to the distrust in government that failure to comply may
cause, failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the
Village of Haskins to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney’s
fees and damages.
      (Ord. 2008-4. Passed 6-16-08.)
133.03 LAW ENFORCEMENT TRUST FUND.
   (a)   There is hereby established a Law Enforcement Trust Fund, to be
managed jointly by the Chief of Police and Village Clerk Treasurer.
   (b)   The Chief of Police is hereby directed to establish written internal
control policy standards, governing the receipt, management, spending and
accounting of all moneys deposited into the Law Enforcement Trust Fund. Such
policy standards shall comply with the mandates of the Ohio Revised Code,
including, but not limited to, Ohio R.C. 2981.11, 2981.13 and 2925.03.
(Ord. 2017-3. Passed 2-6-17.)
133.04 CREDIT CARD USE POLICY.
   (a)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall be responsible for the maintenance,
reissuance, and use by authorized Village employees, officers and elected
officials of all Village-issued credit cards. Such cards shall be used for
Village-approved expenses only. Examples of Village- approved expenses, by
means of illustration and not by limitation, include Village-approved travel
expenses, (fuel, meals, and tips, and overnight stays), purchases of goods and
services needed for the efficient operation of the Village, (tools, parts and
equipment), registration fees for seminars or conferences, and service
contracts that require credit card payments.
   (b)   Only the following persons shall be permitted to use a Village-issued
credit card:
      (1)   Village Administrator
      (2)   Village Clerk-Treasurer
      (3)   Mayor
      (4)   Chief of Police
      (5)   Currently-serving Councilmembers
      (6)   Other employees then-serving, with the consent of not less than two
of the above.
   (c)   All authorized users of a Village-issued credit card shall complete a
Credit Card User Agreement before issuance and use of a Village-issued credit
card. Upon satisfactory evidence that the requested use has been properly
authorized, the Clerk-Treasurer shall provide to the authorized user a Village-
issued credit card. The Fiscal Officer shall maintain all signed Credit Card
User Agreements pursuant to the Village Records Retention Policy. All users of
a Village-issued credit card shall notify all vendors or merchants of the
Village’s sales tax exemption and shall have available the necessary sales tax
exemption forms to present to the vendor or merchant, and shall submit to the
Clerk-Treasurer itemized receipts for all credit card purchases, along with the
Village-issued credit card used for such purchases. The Clerk-Treasurer shall
attach such receipts to the signed Credit Card User Agreement for that use, and
shall confirm the expenses are consistent with the authorization given and
these policies. Monthly, the Clerk- Treasurer shall reconcile the itemized
receipts with the monthly credit card statement, and present such
reconciliation to the Village Council at a regularly scheduled meeting. And
annually, the Clerk-Treasurer shall report to the Village Council a report
detailing all rewards received based on the use of the Village-issued credit
card.
   (d)   Purchase of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, e-cigarette
products, adult- oriented products or services, financial services (ATM), and
personal-use (not Village-related) purchases, are prohibited.
   (e)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall be responsible to ensure that all
Village-issued credit cards are authorized by Village Council and are current,
that interest rates and available balances are consistent with these policies,
that all monthly billing statements are paid timely, and that all authorized
users comply with the policies herein. The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall cancel
any and all credit cards as required by direction of the Village Council, by
reason of fraud or misuse, or as the result of a lost or stolen credit card.
   (f)   No Village-issued credit card shall carry an interest rate greater
than 18% per annum, nor carry an available balance greater than $10,000.
   (g)   Any person that learns of a lost or stolen Village-issued credit card
shall report the lost or stolen credit card to the Village Clerk-Treasurer, or,
if the Clerk-Treasurer is not immediately available, to the Village
Administrator or Mayor, within one hour of learning of such lost or stolen
credit card. Any person learning of the misuse of a Village-issued credit card
by an authorized user or any other person shall report the misuse to the
Village Clerk-Treasurer immediately upon learning of such misuse. Upon learning
of a lost, stolen or misused Village- issued credit card, the Village Clerk-
Treasurer shall immediately take all action necessary to limit losses to the
Village, including, but not limited to, cancellation of the card and reporting
fraud to the credit card issuer.
   (h)   Misuse of a Village-issued credit card shall include losing a Village-
issued credit card, failure to submit itemized receipts of purchases, use of a
Village-issued credit card beyond the scope of given authority, failure to
present a tax exemption certificate at the time of purchase, or any other use
or omission not authorized by or inconsistent with these policies. Upon
learning of the misuse of a Village-issued credit card, if such misuse is by an
authorized user, said user shall be prohibited from further use of Village-
issued credit cards, and shall be subject to discipline as determined by his or
her immediate supervisor, the Mayor, or Village Council, as the case may be,
including repayment of all losses to the Village, (including, but not limited
to, sales tax reimbursement), termination of employment, and criminal
prosecution. Upon separation from employment all employees or officials subject
to discipline for misuse of a Village-issued credit card shall not receive his
or her final pay or accrued benefits until reimbursement is made, or if
reimbursement is not made within fourteen days of separation from employment,
the employee’s final pay and accrued benefits shall be used to offset losses to
the Village resulting from the employee’s misuse of the Village-issued credit
card. The remedies available herein are not limited.
   (i)   “Credit Card” and “Credit Card Account” shall have the same meanings
as in Ohio R.C. 717.31(H). (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 12-3-18.)

   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer of client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer.
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section

performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location " means one of the following:

periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (J)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the location
that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer mav
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpaver is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(J)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (J)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (J)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be situated to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (J)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be situated to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (J)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be situated to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (J)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
181.04 of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)

business in the Village of Haskins shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village of
Haskins. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
181.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
181.01(B)(1), of [1.0]%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer

employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.

deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
municipal corporation in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded
two hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Haskins. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
          (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Haskins as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
          (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the Village of Haskins income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
         (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or
other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                  (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the Village of Haskins the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the Village of Haskins income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Haskins until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
                  (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village of Haskins during the preceding calendar year;
                  (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;

which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during

with respect to such employee;
                  (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax

          (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
          (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Haskins income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
           (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section

municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.

employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Haskins only if the employee spent more time performing services for
or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Haskins than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
          (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this
section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends
performing personal services in the Village of Haskins exceeds the 20-day
threshold, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Haskins
for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village
of Haskins.
                  (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Village of Haskins under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to
withhold tax for the Village of Haskins for the first 20 days on which the
employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed
in the Village of Haskins.

employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
181.02 , the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the

the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Haskins, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the passthrough entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit situated to the
Village of Haskins;

commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one

payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of

           (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under this ordinance and shall be credited and distributed to
the village in accordance with R.C. 718.83.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of combined tax liability shall be due
to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be added
to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:

one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Haskins under Section
181.05 for that year.

entered on the document. (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
181.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
           (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
           (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
           (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
           (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.21 .
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
           (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
           (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
            (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
 181.18 (A)(4).
   (F)    In the event the taxpayer has made the election pursuant to Section
181.27 of this ordinance or R.C. 718.80, an application to refund to a taxpayer
the amount of taxes paid on any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax
under this ordinance, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division A of R.C. 718.90. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (G)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based onteh amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with R.C. 5703.70.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. 718.83.
   (H)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. 5703.47 from the ninety-first
day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On
an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from
the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the
refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Haskins, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Haskins as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Haskins is subject to recovery by the
Village of Haskins. If the Village of Haskins's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the Village of Haskins shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Haskins claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Haskins' tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village of Haskins's tax rate. However, if the Village of Haskins's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Haskins, along with
any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Haskins changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Haskins. The amended return shall be filed
on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.12  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
Section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Haskins. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.09 .
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Haskins tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Village of Haskins return showing
income subject to the Village of Haskins income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional the Village of Haskins income tax shown due thereon or make a claim
for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten
dollars.
(Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and

filed, whichever is later; or
                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
                   (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of
this section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
           (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                  (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                 (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Haskins does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
           (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.09 , with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.09 .
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village of Haskins income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
           (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest (Ord. 2023-10.
Passed 12-18-23.)
181.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
           (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
           (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
                (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the Village of
Haskins official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person
to whom the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
           (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person
was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address;
or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the Village of
Haskins official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Haskins that arises pursuant to the Village of Haskins's
income tax imposed in accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
           (1)    Compromise a claim;
           (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a
claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)
181.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or as provided in R.C. 4123 .271 or
R.C. 5703.21. The tax commissioner or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this Ordinance and other related tax
information to the internal revenue service, the tax commissioner, and tax
administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Haskins from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
   (C)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
the Village tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the tax commissioner under this ordinance and that
had municipal taxable income apportionable to the village under any ordinance
for any prior year.
      (1)    The taxpayer's name, address and federal identification number
      (2)    The taxpayer's apportionment ratio for, and amount of municipal
taxable income apportionable to, the village pursuant to this Ordinance.

by the taxpayer.
      (4)    Whether the taxpayer requested that any overpayment be carried
forward to the future taxable year.
      (5)    The amount of any credit claimed under R.C. 718.94.
   (D)    Not later than thirty days after each distribution made to municipal

village a report stating the name and federal identification number of every
taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to the village and
the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (E)    The information described under division (C) and (D) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the village
tax administrator under R.C. 718.83(D).
   (F)   (1)    The village expects that the tax commissioner will, pursuant to
R.C. 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it receives in the
performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in this ordinance or R.C. 718.80. The
tax administrator shall review these returns and information, as well as the
information received pursuant to divisions (C) and (B) of this section, and has
discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the tax commissioner. Such
referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall
include any information that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 2023-10. Passed 12-18-23.)

Chapter 718 of the Revised Code fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make an assessment against a taxpayer more
than three years after the later of the date the return subject to assessment
was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time limit may
be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in writing to the
extension. Any such extension shall extend the three year time limit herein for
the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment
against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment as
required herein, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give
the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing in the
petition.
   (I)    Unless the taxpayer assessed the files with the tax commissioner
within sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally
or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the
authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the
assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable
from the taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the
taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if
received by the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final
determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall
proceed under section 5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (J)    After an assessment becomes final, if any po1tion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code form the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (K)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (L)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
comt of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of filing of the entry with the clerk. The
total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (M)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state dies not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer, its
assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all
of the information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima-
facie evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of

prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.

the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be lawfully
occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time shown on the
meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established maximum time
limit.

   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and who, as a consequence thereof, is confined in the Wood County
Jail, shall reimburse the Village of Haskins for its expenses incurred by
reason of his or her confinement, including but not limited to, the expenses
relating to the providing of food, clothing, medical care and shelter.
   (b)   The Solicitor is authorized to institute any appropriate civil suit
for the recovery of the expenses referred to in subsection (a) hereof, the
amount of the reimbursement to be determined by the Court pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.15. (Ord. 272. Passed 11-18-85.)

prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.

conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its

901.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Conditions Precedent to Improving Streets. No department of this
Municipality shall accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, curb or light
any street or other way, unless the street or way has been accepted or opened
or otherwise has received the legal status of a public street or way prior to
the effective date of this chapter; or unless the street or way corresponds in
location and extent with a street or way shown on a recorded plat which has
been legally accepted by Council.
   (b)   Opening Permit Required. It shall be unlawful for any person, other
than an authorized Municipal official or the authorized employees or agents of
such municipal official, to make any opening in any street, alley, sidewalk, or
public way of the municipality unless a permit to make the opening has been
obtained prior to commencement of the work.
   (c)   Application and Cash Deposit. Each permit for making an opening shall
be confined to a single project and shall be issued by the Mayor or other
proper municipal officer. Application shall be made on a form prescribed by
Council, giving the exact location of the proposed opening, the kind of paving,
the area and depth to be excavated, and such other facts as may be provided
for. The permit shall be issued only after a cash deposit sufficient to cover
the cost of restoration has been posted with the Mayor or other proper
municipal officer, conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory refilling of
excavations and restoration of all surfaces disturbed.
   (d)   Restoration of Pavement.  
      (1)   The opening and restoration of pavement or other surface shall be
performed under the direction and to the satisfaction of an authorized
Municipal official, and in accordance with rules, regulations, and
specifications approved by Council.
      (2)   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee satisfactorily to fill the
excavation, restore the surface, and remove all excess materials within the
time specified in the permit or where not specified therein, within a
reasonable time after commencement of the work, the Municipality may proceed
without notice to make such fill and restoration, and the deposit referred to
in subsection (c) hereof shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon, the deposit
shall be paid into the street repair fund of the Municipality, except such part
demanded and paid to the permittee as the difference between the deposit and
the charges of the Municipality for restoration services performed by it. If
the amount of such services performed by the Municipality should exceed the
amount of the deposit, the Clerk or other proper municipal officer shall
proceed to collect the remainder due from such permittee.
   (e)   Barriers Around Excavations. Any person engaged in or employing others
in excavating, or opening any street, sidewalk, alley, or other public way
shall have the excavation or opening fully barricaded at all times to prevent
injury to persons or animals.
   (f)   Warning Lights. Any person engaged in or employing others in
excavating or otherwise in any manner obstructing a portion or all of any
street, sidewalk, alley, or other public way, at all times during the night

be securely and conspicuously posted on, at, or near each end of such
obstruction or excavation, and if the space involved shall exceed fifty feet in
extent, then at least one additional lamp for each added fifty feet or portion
thereof excavated or obstructed.

ice accumulated thereon within a reasonable time, which will ordinarily not
exceed twelve hours after any storm during which the snow and ice has
accumulated.
   (l)   Ramped Curbing for Persons With Disabilities. All new curbs that are
authorized by the Municipality, and all existing curbs which are part of any
reconstruction, shall have a ramp with nonslip surface built into the curb at

or an inspection fee in excess of one dollar ($1.00) per installation.

conferred upon the Municipality under Ohio R.C. 727.01 to construct sidewalks,
curbs or gutters and levy an assessment therefor, Council may require the
construction or repair of sidewalks, curbs or gutters within the Municipality
by the owners of lots or lands abutting thereon, and upon the failure of such
owners to construct or repair such sidewalks, curbs or gutters within the time
prescribed in the resolution adopted under subsection (b) hereof, may cause

bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods. If it appears by
the return of service or the return of the certified mail notice that one or

facie evidence of the service of notice under this section. The notice shall
also set forth the place where the specifications governing the construction or

narrowed or the name thereof changed. Council may include in one ordinance the

or narrowing a street or alley, or any part thereof, and that such vacation or
narrowing will not be detrimental to the general interest, it may, by ordinance
and without petition therefor, vacate or narrow such street or alley or any
part thereof.
   (c)   Notice; Exception. Notice of the intention of Council to vacate any
street, alley, avenue, or part thereof shall be given as provided in subsection

the Municipality, by posting the notice in three public places therein six
weeks preceding such action. Action thereon shall take place within three
months after completion of the notice.
   (e)   Effect of Order of Vacation. The order of Council vacating or
narrowing a street or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the
proprietor thereof shall, to the extent to which it is vacated or narrowed,
operate as a revocation of the acceptance thereof by Council, but the right-of-
way and easement therein of any lot owner shall not be impaired by such order.

highway, or a portion thereof, is vacated or narrowed by the Municipality

sewer lines, steam lines, pipelines, gas and water lines, tracks, or other
equipment or appliances of any railroad or public utility, whether owned
privately or by any governmental authority, located on, over or under the
portion of the street, alley, or highway affected by such vacation or
narrowing, is not required for purposes of the Municipality, including urban
renewal, any affected railroad or public utility shall be deemed to have a
permanent easement in such vacated portion or excess portion of such street,
alley or highway for the purpose of maintaining, operating, renewing,
reconstructing, and removing such utility facilities and for purposes of access
to such facilities. (1998 Code Secs. 94.40 to 94.45)

Practice, deems necessary to support receipt and subsequent distribution of
capacity and energy from the DGR.
2.2.    Point of Interconnection shall mean the point at which the DGR
interconnects with the Municipal Utility's Electric System and the point at
which ownership of electric facilities and/or equipment transitions from
Municipal Utility to Owner/Operator, as specified in Appendix A.
2.3.    Transmission Owner shall mean the entity that owns and maintains
transmission facilities.
III.    Establishment of Point of Interconnection.
3.1.    Municipal Utility will evaluate the capability of the existing

Municipal Utility's sole discretion, a system study may be required to
determine the adequacy of the distribution system to interconnect a DGR. Owner/
Operator is responsible to all costs for the system impact study is completed.
Municipal Utility reserves the right to disallow the interconnection of the DGR
if in its sole discretion the DGR will adversely impact Municipal Utility's
distribution system.
3.2.   Determination of the Point of Interconnection is at Municipal Utility’s
sole discretion. Municipal Utility and Owner/Operator agree to interconnect the
DGR at the Point of Interconnection in accordance with Municipal Utility’s

as defined herein.
   (h)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge of the receiving waters.
   (i)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes in
the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended solids which
interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-15-97.)
921.16 AUTHORITY FOR CONTROL OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES.

921.15 , and which in the judgment of the engineer, may have a deleterious
effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, including violation of applicable water quality standards, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the engineer
shall, may reject the wastes; require pretreatment to an acceptable condition
for discharge to the sewers; require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge and/or require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes.
   (b)   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations,

unless such standards conflict with regulations promulgated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, in which case the regulations promulgated by
the Environmental Protection Agency shall govern. Sampling methods, location,
times, duration and frequencies shall be determined on an individual basis
subject to approval by the Superintendent. All costs incident to sampling and
analyses shall be borne by the owner. Such costs incurred by the Village shall
be billed annually to the owner, based on actual cost to the Village, plus
reasonable overhead. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-15-97.)
921.20 SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the Village for treatment, subject to possible payment therefore by the
industrial concern for subsequent treatment. Any industrial concern may appeal
to the Council and determination made by the engineer in the enforcement of
this chapter. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-15-97.)
921.21 SUBMISSION OF BASIC DATA.
   Within thirty days after passage of this chapter, each person whose
operation entails the discharge of industrial waters to a public sewer shall
prepare and file with the engineer a written statement setting forth the nature
of the operation contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of
water required for use, the proposed point of discharge of said wastes into the
wastewater collection system of the Village, the estimated amount to be so
discharged, and a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial,
physical, chemical, and other known characteristics of said wastes. Within a
reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of the
Village to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the judgment
of the engineer may be necessary to adequately guard against unlawful uses of
the Village’s wastewater system. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-15-97.)

meter readings maintained by the Village except as herein provided in this
section. If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the Village
water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the
person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type
approved by the engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water.
The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers may install and
maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the volume of waste
being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial waste surcharge
would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type acceptable to the
engineer. The engineer may require the installation of the devices for
measuring the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records. Any metering device for
determining the volume of waste discharged to the public sewer shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person responsible for its discharge.
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the
consent of the engineer.

wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may be deemed necessary by
the engineer but in no case less than two (2) 24- hour composite samples per
month. The owner shall be responsible for the collection and testing of the
aforementioned samples. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the
engineer or his authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the sample was taken. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-
15-97.)
921.26 INDUSTRIAL ANALYSES.
   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes shall be
those set forth in the latest edition of “Standard Methods”, Section
921.19 . However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes
may be used subject to mutual agreement between the engineer and the person
responsible for its discharge. Determination of the character and concentration
of the industrial wastes shall be made by the person responsible for the
discharge, or his qualified agent as approved by the engineer. The results of
the analyses shall be reported to the Village on a monthly basis on forms
provided by the Village. The Village shall make its own analyses of the wastes,
and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances in the following paragraph. In case the analyses performed by the
industry and the Village result in substantially different values, an effort
shall be made by the industry to collect samples at the same time the Village
collects its own samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected
by the Village and the industry shall be compared using the same testing
procedures as outlined in the latest edition of “Standard Methods” and the
differences negotiated. (Ord. 386-1997. Passed 12-15-97.)

ADJUSTMENTS AND BILLING CATEGORIES:
Haskins Village reserves the right to make justified adjustments to the
Table of Unit Billing. The Village Administrator will make the
determination as to the assignment of billing categories per Property
Owner and any appeals for special consideration must be made in writing to
the Haskins Village Council. Property Owner types not herein defined shall
be charged on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Streets and
Utilities Committee of the Haskins Village Council. Sewer rates and
charges are subject to annual review as in the overall rate structure
Ordinance for the Waste Water Treatment Facility debt retirement,
maintenance and operation.
ISSUANCE OF BILLS:
The Haskins Utilities Bill will be issued to the Property Owner. However, in
the event that the property is occupied by an individual or entity other than
the Property Owner and the individual or entity registers with the Haskins
Village to have any portion of the Haskins Utilities Bill issued to them, the
Haskins Utilities Bill will be issued to the registrant. The Property Owner of
record at the time the sewer charges are incurred is responsible for payment of
all such charges, regardless of who occupied the property at the time such
charges were incurred.
ADJUSTMENTS TO UNIT BILLING FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USERS:
In those cases where the unit billing is based upon the number of enrolled
persons in a school, the enrollment shall be verified by the Village
Administrator twice annually, once at the beginning of each school year and
then again at the end of the school year (to determine out of session
enrollment). Adjustments in enrollment shall be applied at the next billing
cycle or otherwise at the discretion of the Village Administrator. For those
instances where enrollment in an Elementary School exceeds or is less than the
quantifier of 100, the sewer charge shall be
increased or decreased at the rate of $0.95 per student, per month. For those
instances where enrollment in a High or Junior High School exceeds or is less
than the quantifier of 100, the sewer charge shall be increased or decreased at
the rate of $1.89 per student, per month. In the case of a day care facility,
enrollment shall be verified once annually. All schools and day care facilities
are however subject to a minimum monthly charge of 1 unit, or Set Monthly Rate
(See Rate Chart).
In those cases where the unit billing is based upon the number of employed
persons, such number shall be verified annually by the Village Administrator.
Any increases above the quantified of 1 unit per 20 employees shall be charged
at the rate of $3.15 per employee, per month. Due to the fact that a minimum
charge of 1 unit, (See Rate Chart), is applicable, there cannot be any
deductions from the rate in those instances where there are less than 20
employees.

   The Village shall determine, based on service requested, the schedule to be
assigned to each customer.
   The above rates are net if all accounts for this service are paid in full
within fifteen (15) days from date of bill. If not so paid, the gross rates
shall apply which are ten percent (10%) in excess of the above net rates. (Ord.
2023-9. Passed 9-18-23.)
929.14 DEMAND DETERMINATION.
   (a)   Customers demand shall be taken monthly, or by test at any time during
the month to the highest registration of a fifteen (15) minute integrating
demand meter or indicator, or the highest registration of a thermal type demand
meter. The monthly billing demands will be based on sixty percent (60%) or the
highest measure of KVA demand reading during the preceding eleven (11) months
or actual demand of current month; whichever is highest. Where energy is
delivered through two or more meters, the monthly billing demand will be taken
as the sum of the two demands separately determined. Demand meters shall be
used for all customers in Schedule B and C.
   (b)   The utility and/or Village reserves the right to install such demand
meters as it, in its sole discretion, may deem reasonable and/or proper. In
lieu of the installation of a demand meter, the utility and/or Village may
estimate the demand of the customers.

supply service to welders, xray machines, etc. will be five dollars ($5.00) per
kilovoltampers of installed transformer capacity.
   (b)   This schedule is also available to customers having other sources of
energy supply, but who desire to purchase energy from the utility. Where such
conditions exist, the customer shall contract from the maximum amount of demand
in KW which the utility might be required to furnish, but not less than three
(3) KW.
   (c)   The utility shall not be obligated to supply demands in excess of that
contracted for. In the event that the customer's actual demand as determined by
demand meter or indicator in any month exceeds the amount of his then, existing
contract demand, the contract demand shall then be increased automatically to
the maximum demand so created by the customer. Where service is supplied under
the provisions of the paragraph, the billing demand each month shall be Five
(5) KW or the contract demand, whichever is greater, and the minimum charge
shall be as follows instead of the minimum charge set forth under paragraph
"Minimum Charge" above:

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
